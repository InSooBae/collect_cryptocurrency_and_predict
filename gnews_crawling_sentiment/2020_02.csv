2020-02-11,"Bitcoin is largely believed the be the most popular cryptocurrency.

The crypto coin made national news in 2017 when its value unexpectedly skyrocketed to $19,873 per share, highlighting the general idea of cryptocurrency and blockchain on a global scale before it was largely being considered as an alternative currency option.

6 REASONS BITCOIN HAS NEARLY TRIPLED IN 6 MONTHS

""The most popular crypto is Bitcoin ... because it was the first one to be widely used and is generally considered the safest to own,"" Alex Mashinsky, CEO at Celsius Network, a crypto lending and depository company, told FOX Business. ""Bitcoin is up 9 million [percent] in the last decade, outpacing Wall Street top performer Netflix, which returned 4,000 [percent] during the same time.""

One Bitcoin is worth nearly $10,000 as of Feb. 8, according to Google Disclaimer.

WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF CRYPTOCURRENCY?

Mashinsky noted that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular because they ""bypass all the fees and tolls banks [that] credit cards and financial platforms charge us today. These new rails enable new services and products to be created that act in the best interests of the user and the community and not the banks and Wall Street.""

""The young crypto community is trying to create these new services and convince hundreds of millions of users to move their assets to the new rails,"" he added.

Richard Dennis, founder and CEO of a cryptocurrency called TemTum, noted that while the ""speed of settlement, which takes several days on the traditional banking system,"" it takes only about an hour with cryptocurrency, and banking hours are not an issue.

“The popularity of cryptocurrencies is clear to see,"" he said, adding that benefits include ""greater security, faster payments and audible qualities"" that have ""made the industry take notice of cryptocurrencies so much so that national states and central banks and frantically working on trying to catch up and deploy this technology for their people.""

Other popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Litecoin, Monero and EOS. Even Facebook announced plans to start a cryptocurrency called Libra --- an idea that came under strong government scrutiny and quickly lost support.","FinTech magazine explores the future market for cryptocurrencies, including Libra, Bitcoin and CryptoKittie.

This year, the fate of cryptocurrencies hangs in the balance. Thankfully, there are several indicators that this may also be the year that the industry finds its footing.

All new technologies start out in life as immature, limited versions of themselves that nevertheless brim with possibilities. Inventions and new applications tied to a new technology are often less focused, less predictable, and more likely to disappear into the mists of history - like using those newfangled round stones with a hole in the middle as hats instead of putting them on the bottoms of wheelbarrows (one assumes) and, more recently, Betamax.

As technologies develop successful use cases and markets begin to develop, they reach maturity. Then, anywhere from a decade to a few centuries later, they’re about as prone to radical evolution as a sea sponge, or the pushbike.

Plenty of technologies don’t make it to maturity. As investors get impatient and customers are distracted by the next big thing, the race to demonstrate a technology becomes increasingly frantic.

Digital ledger technology - known as blockchain - first appeared as a verification list or record used to track cryptocurrency transactions. Invented in 2008 by a person (or group of people) going under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto, blockchain technology was initially tied completely to the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and has become closely linked with other blockchain-powered forms of digital currency as well. This symbiotic relationship is somewhat unusual.

According to Lorenzo Pellegrino at CoinTelegraph, it’s rare to find a sector where “the value of the underlying technology is often perceived in line with market capitalisation.” That’s like if the scooter manufacturer Vespa went under and everyone started selling off their stock in Carnival Cruises because both use combustion engines. Crazy, right?

Perhaps not. Cryptocurrencies are the flagship (read: most mature) application for blockchain technologies. While there are more and more promising applications for digital ledger technology popping up all the time, from supply chain track and trace to buying, breeding and trading little cartoon cats for as much as $113,000 - but more on that in a minute - the success of cryptocurrencies is responsible for a large part of the confidence and investment in blockchain.

Back at the outset of 2018, leading economist Nouriel Roubini wrote that “blockchain, which has existed for almost a decade, and still has only one application: cryptocurrencies. Blockchain’s boosters would argue that its early days resemble the early days of the internet, before it had commercial applications.

But that comparison is simply false. Whereas the internet quickly gave rise to email, the World Wide Web, and millions of viable commercial ventures used by billions of people, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin do not even fulfil their own stated purpose.” Two years on, has the good ship Crypto been righted?

Well, 2019 was a mixed year for cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underpins them. As the industry emerged from the ‘crypto winter’ in the wake of 2017’s Bitcoin high point of almost $20,000, and the 2018 market meltdown, some authorities argued that, this year, cryptocurrencies failed to deliver on expectations. Vinny Lingham, co-founder and CEO of Civic Inc said last month that “when the crypto community looks back at 2019, it will be remembered as the lost year.

This is not unexpected because 2017 was such a milestone year. I like to say that the bigger the party, the bigger the hangover. We’re still dealing with the hangover.” According to co-founder of cryptocurrency tracking and tax software company Accointing Alex Lindenmeyer, “2020 will be a put-up-or-shut-up moment for cryptocurrency. Either coins start to prove their merit, or they will start to disappear.”

It appears that 2020 is the year that the fate of cryptocurrencies hangs in the balance. Thankfully, there are several indicators that this may also be the year that the industry finds its footing. Cryptocurrencies are finding support and investment from big players in both the public and private sectors, as well as finding new use cases that allow it to tap into new markets.

Here are the three cryptocurrency trends that FinTech Magazine thinks will make or break the industry over the coming 12 months.

Halvening the Bitcoin

A lot of what’s going to happen to cryptocurrencies this year is speculation, but one event that’s almost a concrete certainty is slated to occur around May. The rate at which the Bitcoin blockchain awards crypto miners with pieces of currency is about to be cut in half. This happens every time 210,000 blocks have been mined from the blockchain - which equates to roughly every four years - until all the Bitcoins have been mined.

The process is an important part of stabilising the world’s first cryptocurrency, and making sure that Bitcoin is healthy is essential. In the same way that the fate of blockchain as a technology is manacled to cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies themselves are bound to their poster child.

Bitcoin halvings are important events for crypto traders as they reduce the number of new bitcoins being generated by the network as we draw closer to the day when there are no new coins to add into circulation. This limits the supply of new coins, so prices could rise if demand remains strong.

Keeping Bitcoin stable in this fashion could be a key step in preventing any more crashes and volatility - a necessary goal if cryptocurrencies want to attract the kind of positive attention that will allow them to ramp up adoption.

Libra and company

One thing that’s expected to direct massive amounts of attention towards cryptocurrencies this year is Facebook’s launch of its own digital currency. Libra has a mission “to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people,” according to the project’s white paper. The currency has backing not only from Facebook, but from more than a dozen companies across the financial, e-commerce, tech and telecommunications industries.

Libra is being billed as a ‘stablecoin’ which will have a value that is linked to several global currencies, including the US Dollar, the Euro and the Yen. Another way in which Libra plans to create stability is by running in a centralised fashion.

Whereas Bitcoin allows anyone with a computer to run it as a node on the blockchain, Libra will initially only run on servers of the companies that are backing the currency: Ebay, Uber, Paypal, Facebook. The white paper said that Facebook has plans to decentralise Libra over the next five years, but for now the extra speed that centralising the process generates is a necessary step.

Bringing a stable cryptocurrency to the 2-and-a-bit billion Facebook users - particularly those in underbanked nations - may be a massive adoption driver for the technology. Depending on how well Libra’s first year goes, it could mark cryptocurrency’s entry into the true mainstream.

Expensive hats, cats and crypto loot

Virtual goods - everything from powerful weapons to Hello Kitty robes for your wizard - are already a $50bn industry. However, a gamer that shells out money for an item doesn’t really own that item. If they delete the game, or have their account frozen, or any number of other issues, that asset is gone forever.

For the last few years, companies like Forte and Animoca have been working to use blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to turn these pixelated designs and files into permanent assets.

Remember earlier when I mentioned the $100,000 cartoon cat? Well, we’re back to that. Launched in December 2017, the game CryptoKitties is, according to TechCrunch, “essentially like a digital version of Pokemon cards but based on the Ethereum blockchain.” The game allows users to use Ethereum, one of the leading cryptocurrencies, to purchase a digital cat with certain genetic traits.

By breeding that cat with other digital cats, you create new, even cuter (or usually weirder) looking cats and then sell them to other players in exchange for more Ethereum. Or you just collect the cats because you think they’re cute and humans will pay money to collect anything.

Anyway, CryptoKitties went viral a few years ago and, while it’s really just a proof of concept wrapped up in some super cute artwork, the point was well made: cryptocurrencies and blockchain encryption can play a major role in legitimising in game transactions. With the video gaming industry generating more than $150bn in 2019, and an estimated 2.5bn gamers around the world, if cryptocurrencies are going to find real world applications anywhere this year, it’s going to be here.

If you’re one of the many people looking to get into bitcoin for the first time, it doesn’t have to be hard. There are more than a few easy routes to acquiring cryptocurrency and this article aims to outline five of them. By way of these simple avenues for purchasing bitcoin you can be stacking and spending satoshis in no time.

Getting Into Bitcoin

As the crypto market is alive with gains recently, renewed interest in bitcoin has taken hold yet again. For those new to crypto, the first step can be the hardest: simply “getting in.” While there is definitely a learning curve to some aspects of crypto, buying, storing and using bitcoin doesn’t need to be complicated. Below we’ll cover five easy ways to buy bitcoin. Before moving forward, though, it’s important to know what kind of bitcoin you want to buy. Information on the difference between bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC) can be found here.

Face to Face

One of the more rewarding, direct, and private ways to buy bitcoin is through a direct transaction with a seller. This could be a trusted friend or acquaintance living nearby, or someone at a bitcoin meetup looking to sell crypto for cash. Local bitcoin meetups are great places to connect with other crypto enthusiasts, and often members like to trade while in attendance. If this is the route you choose to take, be sure to learn about some best practices and tips for safe trading in person, first.

Use a P2P Trading Platform

Another way to buy directly is to connect with a seller via a peer-to-peer platform like local.Bitcoin.com where buyers can select a variety of payment methods including Paypal, bank transfer, and cash-in-person. You can even trade goods for crypto via the site. Each user has different offers and charges different rates, so be sure to choose a seller with a good reputation, fair price, and history of completed trades.

Local.bitcoin.com focuses exclusively on bitcoin cash (BCH), but there are other platforms that provide similar peer-to-peer services for buying bitcoin core (BTC), like Localbitcoins. Each platform for buying crypto peer-to-peer requires different amounts of identification to make a trade. For example, local.Bitcoin.com only requires an email address and is extremely private, while other platforms can require extensive details via their know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) policies.

Use a Credit Card

A very easy way to buy some bitcoin is to use a credit card. This can be done at buy.Bitcoin.com, and users can choose to purchase either bitcoin cash or bitcoin core.

Once you click the buy button, there’s a prompt to enter a bitcoin wallet address. For users without a bitcoin wallet, there are instructions linked via the “Need a wallet?” option that can provide assistance in downloading one for free. Though this buy option charges a set service fee, the trade-off is that it’s very convenient and quick. Also, all that is required is an email address.

Use a Bitcoin ATM

Bitcoin ATMs are popping up all over the place and provide a convenient means for investing in cryptocurrencies. Due to applicable regulations, this option is typically not as private as a direct, peer-to-peer trade, but for buyers comfortable with sharing some personal information, these machines can provide an easy on-ramp to the world of crypto.

The site Coinatmradar site is a good resource for locating a machine near you. Users can select their location, the type of crypto they wish to buy or sell, and find an ATM nearby. The service also provides info on the individual ATMs submitted by providers and users regarding the machine’s current status. For buyers in California, U.S., many popular Coinstar kiosks now feature a bitcoin buy option as well.

Buy Bitcoin on an Exchange

An established and reputable cryptocurrency exchange can be a relatively simple and convenient way to buy bitcoin with credit card or via bank account. As with peer-to-peer trading platforms, each exchange will have different KYC/AML requirements, fees, capabilities and special offers, so it’s important to research any potential choice carefully before making a decision.

Crypto exchanges for beginners which are very popular include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Bitcoin.com now also has its own crypto exchange. Mainstream exchanges usually provide the option to buy bitcoin with a credit card or through bank account deposit.

An important thing to note about exchanges, however, is that if your bitcoin is stored custodially (meaning you don’t have the private keys) and the exchange is hacked or experiences problems, you may lose your money. This is why it is advisable to move funds to a private, non-custodial wallet as soon as possible after purchasing bitcoin, and to only keep the bare minimum of what’s needed to transact on a centrally managed exchange.

FILE PHOTO: A delegate talks on his phone at the Delta Summit, Malta's official Blockchain and Digital Innovation event promoting cryptocurrency, in Ta' Qali, Malta October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi

Last year’s losses were up nearly 160% from 2018’s total of $1.74 billion.

Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering bitcoin, is a shared database maintained by a network of computers.

Cryptocurrency user and investor losses due to fraud and misappropriation in 2019 increased by more than five times, while hacks and thefts fell by 66%, the report showed.

“We noticed a significant uptick in malicious insiders scamming unsuspecting victims or leaching on their users through Ponzi schemes,” Dave Jevans, CipherTrace chief executive officer, told Reuters. “Attacks from the inside of organizations lead to significant exits with major consequence to the crypto-ecosystem.”

Since bitcoin’s launch more than 10 years ago, governments and regulators around the world have grappled with the opaqueness and lack of transparency in the cryptocurrency market that has led to massive losses for investors.

Two large losses early last year were the main drivers for the surge, CipherTrace said.

Users and customers lost roughly $3 billion from an alleged Ponzi scheme involving crypto wallet and exchange PlusToken.

The other significant loss was the almost $135 million that customers lost from Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX following the unexpected death of its co-founder, according to CipherTrace.

The CipherTrace report also found illicit cryptocurrency money service businesses - including crypto exchanges - have transmitted funds on the payment networks of almost all the top 10 U.S. retail banks.

Analysis further revealed that a typical large U.S. bank processes billions of dollars annually in undetected cryptocurrency-related transfers.

“These clandestine operations create AML (anti-money laundering) compliance risks because criminals must find ways to launder ill-gotten crypto profits,” CipherTrace said in the report.

CipherTrace research found that banks globally paid more than $6.2 billion in AML fines in 2019.","Trump Views Crypto a Threat, Proposes Countermeasures in New Budget

The White House released the Budget of the U.S. Government on Monday, outlining some proposals to increase cryptocurrency oversight which President Donald Trump views as priorities. The budget proposes giving the Treasury more power over crypto and requests funding for FinCEN to expand its efforts to combat threats including from cryptocurrency.

Increased Crypto Oversight

Trump’s new budget has a few proposals concerning cryptocurrency. The 138-page Budget of the U.S. Government for the Fiscal Year 2021 is his fourth proposed budget to Congress. Regarding cryptocurrency, it proposes returning the U.S. Secret Service to the Department of Treasury. Established in 1865, the federal law enforcement agency was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. Trump’s budget states:

Technological advancements in recent decades, such as cryptocurrencies and the increasing interconnectedness of the international financial marketplace, have resulted in more complex criminal organizations and revealed stronger links between financial and electronic crimes and the financing of terrorists and rogue state actors.

The document further reads: “The budget proposes legislation to return the U.S. Secret Service to Treasury to create new efficiencies in the investigation of these crimes and prepare the nation to face the threats of tomorrow.”

Cybercrime is under the purview of the Secret Service, which includes illicit activities involving cryptocurrency, such as cryptojacking and installing crypto mining software, the agency’s website details.

More Power to FinCEN

Trump’s budget also requests $127 million for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the Department of the Treasury. Its mission is to combat money laundering and safeguard the country’s financial system from illicit use.

The budget document explains that the bureau “links law enforcement and intelligence agencies with financial institutions and regulators, leading to the discovery and prosecution of money-laundering schemes and other crimes that cause lasting harm to Americans and the economy,” elaborating:

These resources would enhance FinCEN’s protection of data collected under the Bank Secrecy Act, which would increase its value to law enforcement agencies, and expand its efforts to combat emerging virtual currency and cybercrime threats.

FinCEN has already been strictly enforcing its rules on crypto service providers operating money service businesses, including exchanges. Its “travel rule” requires crypto exchanges to verify their users’ identities, identify the original parties and beneficiaries of transfers of $3,000 or higher, and transmit that information to counterparties if they exist.

Furthermore, the Cryptocurrency Act of 2020 proposes that FinCEN regulates cryptocurrencies, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates crypto-commodities and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates crypto-securities.

Just What Trump Wants

While many are criticizing Trump’s new budget, the media reported that it is dead on arrival and largely a political document. During a speech on the Senate floor on Monday, Senate Budget Chairman Mike Enzi said that he will not hold a hearing on Trump’s $4.8 trillion budget, Politico reported. The chairman added that he did not hold a hearing for former President Barack Obama’s budget either. “Nobody has listened to the president in the 23 years that I’ve been here,” the Wyoming Republican was quoted as saying. “Congress doesn’t pay attention to the president’s budget exercise. I don’t know why we put him through that.”

Trump has always been skeptical of cryptocurrency. “I am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” he tweeted in July last year. “Unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.”

Bitcoin's broader uptrend is still valid despite Monday's sudden move lower from $10,200. The weekly chart shows scope for a test of the October high of $10,350.

A deeper pullback to support below $9,600 may be seen before the return of the rally, as the short duration charts are indicating buyer exhaustion.

A UTC close under $9,075 (Feb. 4 high) would invalidate the bullish setup.

Bitcoin’s broader bullish trend is intact despite Monday’s sharp retreat from a 3.5-month high over $10,000.

The cryptocurrency ran into offers near $10,200 and fell to levels near $9,730 during the Asian trading hours on Monday and spent the rest of the day trading in the narrow range of $9,750–$9,900.

Prices closed Monday (UTC) with a 3.18 percent loss, the second-largest daily decline of 2020 – the first being a 3.2 percent slide seen on Jan. 23, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Some observers are disappointed bitcoin’s break above $10,000 was short-lived. “Disheartening to see BTC reject us not even 24 hours after breaking 10K,” derivatives trader John Wick tweeted earlier on Tuesday.

According to Wick, the speed of bitcoin’s ascent (or bullish momentum) has slowed. After all, Monday’s drop completely engulfed the price gains seen on Sunday – a sign of buyer exhaustion.

However, the broader uptrend from January lows below $7,000 is still intact because prices are hovering well above the base (higher low) of $9,075, established on Feb. 4.

As long as that support stays intact, the path of least resistance will remain to the higher side. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $9,796, representing a 0.58 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.

Daily chart

Bitcoin has carved out a bearish engulfing pattern, marking a negative follow-through to Sunday’s bullish “marubozu” candle.

A failed marubozu at multi-month highs often paves the way for deeper price pullbacks.

Hourly chart

Bitcoin breached the head-and-shoulders neckline support during the Asian trading hours Tuesday. So far, the downside has been contained near $9,700.

The breakdown, however, could yet encourage selling and lead to a stronger move to the downside. The cryptocurrency looks set to revisit former hurdle-turned-support at $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) in the short term. Acceptance below that level would expose the Feb. 4 low of $9,075.

The immediate bullish case would be revived if prices rise above $10,010, invaliding the lower-highs setup on the hourly charts, as discussed yesterday.

Building a base?

It’s worth noting that corrections are a normal occurrence in bull markets and often end up recharging engines for the next leg higher. “If I was climbing a rock wall I would want to constantly re-anchor. Same idea with assets, build a base,” popular trader Cantering Clark tweeted Monday.

For instance, bitcoin fell from $9,188 on Jan. 19 and revisited the former hurdle-turned-support of $8,200 five days later, before rallying above $10,000.

While the ongoing correction may be extended, the crucial support at $9,075 will likely hold as the longer duration charts are reporting strong bullish conditions.

Weekly chart

Bitcoin has risen strongly over the last few weeks, having witnessed a falling channel breakout in early January.

The MACD histogram is printing higher consecutive bars above the zero line, a sign of the strengthening of bullish momentum. The five- and 10-day averages are also trending north in favor of the bulls.

Overall, the weekly chart is aligned in favor of a rally to the October high of $10,350.","Grayscale says ‘real growing’ effort is under way to move activity away from China, which dominates digital coin mining.

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency asset manager said on Tuesday that it was seeing efforts to shift bitcoin production to North America from China, which dominates digital coin mining.

“What I have seen recently, probably over the past three to six months, is a real growing shift towards attempts to move a lot of that activity outside of China into specifically the United States and Canada,” said Barry Silbert, founder of New York-based Grayscale Investments, in an online presentation to investors. Silbert did not specify why the shift was happening.

Many mainstream investors such as pension funds or asset managers have been reluctant to embrace bitcoin, concerned at its volatility, security breaches and lack of transparent markets.

Bitcoin, heavily favoured by enthusiasts and retail investors since it emerged more than a decade ago, has gained increasing interest from hedge funds and trading firms. Many are drawn to its potential for high returns in an era of rock-bottom interest rates.

Miners in China currently control two-thirds or about 66 percent of the power of all computers around the world that are hooked up to the bitcoin network, according to a report by digital asset manager CoinShares. Chinese firms such as Bitmain have become among the world’s biggest miners and manufacturers of bitcoin mining hardware. Another maker, Canaan, launched an initial public offering in November.

That dominance has allowed Chinese miners to produce greater numbers of coins, and has also stoked demand for mining gear produced in the country. However, crypto-mining remains a highly opaque sector, with little reliable data on the bitcoin network or bitcoin miners.

Bitcoin miners draw on huge amounts of computing power as they battle against others to solve complex mathematical equations to earn new coins. The higher the hashrate, the more power is needed to produce bitcoin.

At Tuesday’s bitcoin price of around $10,300, miners produce bitcoin worth around $6.7bn every year.

The lucrative activity often takes place in cold climates or sparsely populated areas, such as Scandinavia and Quebec, because of the vast amounts of heat it produces.

Grayscale, which oversees around $3.1bn worth of cryptocurrencies, has been striving to attract larger investors to digital coins.

Last month, it became the first digital currency investment vehicle to attain the status of reporting company at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it said on Tuesday. This subjects its crypto-products to the same reporting standards as those traded on major exchanges.","The best nonprofits and charities are efficient, effective and engaging. They channel donations to where they’re most needed, they make significant improvements to people’s lives, and they inspire donors and supporters to continue giving. Achieving all of these goals is a challenge for even the largest organization, and that’s why I founded my own Bitcoin charity, BitGive, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. I knew then and have grown even more confident that blockchain and cryptocurrency can improve charitable giving — and, therefore, improve the world.

Because the Bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger, it offers unique opportunities for transparency in charity. Anyone can track the movement of cryptocurrency from wallet to wallet; and it makes auditing and accounting easier for nonprofits. In a more efficient, blockchain-powered world, funds once earmarked for fees and administration costs or lost in delays can be redirected toward fulfilling the nonprofit’s mission. Furthermore, end-to-end transparency incentivizes efficiency and honesty by making the charitable record universally auditable and rewarding those nonprofits that make efficient use of their resources.

Instant Accountability

BitGive created the donation tracking GiveTrackplatform so that donors, potential donors and even cryptocurrency skeptics could see the power that blockchain can bring to charitable giving. Tracking makes a persuasive case for cryptocurrency and blockchain; it also makes the case for renewed giving. If you can see your donation has been put to good use, you’re more likely to make further donations. You’ve seen proof; you don’t have to rely on hope and faith that your assets have been put to good use.

Even better, blockchain offers a vision of instant accountability. With blockchain accounting, there’s no need for donors to wait for quarterly or biannual reports to see what their funds have accomplished since a real-time record is available.

Faster Delivery of Resources

Bitcoin travels faster than regular donations; it bypasses bureaucracies and moves swiftly around the world. It’s the same everywhere, no matter what kind of government a country has or what currency it uses. In China, blockchain has already begun making charities more transparent and traceable. The anti-plastic Empower project makes individual impacts on the environment trackable. As its founders explain, “You sponsor cleanups around the world, you leave a positive footprint, and help create paid work for the people who need it.”

While we’ve made huge strides increasing the speed at which donations are funneled from donors to NGOs, the ease with which funds are contributed and the traceability of every gift, there remains growth opportunities for bitcoin-based charities. To reach their full potential, blockchain projects, including nonprofits, need to continue strengthening end-to-end transparency.

In the end, nonprofits will ensure transparency from the donor wallet to the last foot of the last mile. Existing technology gives us access to just about everywhere in the world, but there’s still room for improvement. As we continue to grow mainstream adoption and continue to invest in ecosystem development and interface upgrades, access will grow easier everywhere — but particularly in developing countries.

The Future of Bitcoin Charity

What do I think the future holds for blockchain charity? I believe that ease of use will continue to improve and that advances in mainstream bitcoin acceptance will smooth the way for many charities now forced to transact in fiat currency. The Bitcoin blockchain has incredible potential for making the world more efficient and for improving lives around the world. Our initial work with BitGive has proven this; the coming years’ work will prove it again.

It’s important to remember the stated goals of Satoshi Nakamoto in the original Bitcoin white paper. Satoshi saw centralized institutions like the major banks fail the people they ostensibly served. Bitcoin was intended to help people — making the world better is one of crypto’s basic values. That’s why I think bitcoin charity will continue to grow, to expand, and to change the world.

","North Korea’s top leaders appear to be intensifying efforts to mine cryptocurrency as a way to evade international sanctions, according to a new report

State-sponsored crypto-crime: The report by Recorded Future, a US company that analyzes cybersecurity threats, details the efforts of Kim Jong-un’s regime to use cybercrime and cryptocurrency to get around sanctions meant to curb the nation’s nuclear weapons program. The United Nations recently estimated that North Korea has stolen as much as $2 billion using “widespread and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks” on financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges. Both the UN and Recorded Future had reported previously that in addition to stealing cryptocurrency, the regime had also started mining it. The new report adds more details about the mining effort and suggests that North Korea is expanding this particular operation.

A steady buildup: In July of 2017, Recorded Future published one of the first reports suggesting that North Korea’s government was mining Bitcoin. A year later the company noted that North Korea’s interest in and use of cryptocurrencies had “exploded.” Besides pulling off a number of successful robberies of South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, the regime had begun mining a privacy-oriented currency called Monero. Unlike Bitcoin, whose public transaction record makes it possible to track money flows, Monero uses cryptography to hide transaction information from public view and make the flow of money very difficult to trace. The authors of the new report say that North Korea’s Monero mining efforts appear to have increased tenfold since 2018.

A “valuable tool”: Considering this development and the country’s successful exchange hacks and other crypto-related thefts, the authors conclude that “cryptocurrencies are a valuable tool for North Korea as an independent, loosely-regulated source of revenue generation, but also as a means of moving and using illicitly obtained funds.”

2020-02-12,"Several big things just happened with cryptocurrencies, and they all seem bullish.

Bitcoin (BTC) closed above $10,000 for the first time since September. Ethereum (ETH) also ripped through resistance around $224. Meanwhile, Google search data show interest in the market almost doubling this year to a six-month high.

“Every major central bank is currently taking a deep look” at cryptocurrencies, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress yesterday. “We’re working hard on it, and we have a lot of projects going on right now.”

While those comments lit a fire under BTCUSD halfway through the morning, other stories have also boosted sentiment. Last Friday, for example, the German newspaper Handelsblatt reported 40 ordinary banks are seeking regulatory approval to provide cryptocurrency services.

IOV Labs also released a new “interoperability bridge” letting users transact in BTC and ETH at the same time. Developers see this as a step toward a functional crypto-based financial system.

Bitcoin Halving on the Horizon

These stories come when investors are already anticipating major events for the two largest cryptocurrencies.

BTC, the biggest crypto, has its “halving” in May. That will reduce the supply of new tokens — a scarcity mechanism established by its mythical creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The previous two halvings in November 2012 and July 2016 lifted prices.

Second, ETH’s developers plan to release a major upgrade called Ethereum 2.0. That could make it faster and more efficient for its intended use as a decentralized financial platform. July is the expected timeframe.

Finally, “altcoins” like ETH and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are rising faster than market leader BTC. It’s pushed BTC’s “dominance” to the lowest since last summer. The recent shift is also reminiscent of early 2017 when cryptocurrencies began a significant run higher. It’s essentially like breadth in the stock market, when investors widen their buying from a few large companies to smaller names.

In conclusion, money is trickling back to blockchain assets as price action, news reports and coming events give the market reasons for hope.

The world’s top cryptocurrencies have shot up in price and prompted hopes that a boom is on the way.

Back in 2017, the financial world was stunned when the value of Bitcoin shot up to $20,000 – but then watched with dismay as it plunged over the course of 2018.

Now it’s hoped that the good old days are coming back again.

Over the course of the past month, the price of Bitcoin has rocketed from $8,000 to $10,000, whilst Ethereum has shot up from just over $220 to a high of more than $250.

The surge may be driven by positive news from big financial institutions.

JP Morgan, for instance, is rumoured to be planning to merge its own blockchain unit Quorum with a Brooklyn-based startup called ConsenSys.

This would be an enormous vote of confidence from a big bank and represents the sort of institutional support which could shore up the notoriously volatile crypto markets and push the digital currencies towards mainstream adoption.

It’s also hoped the rumoured link-up will cause a ‘bull market’, which means a market that’s growing and experiencing price rises.

On Twitter, the respected crypto-focused account Satoshi Flipper wrote: ‘So why is this so bullish for Ethereum?

‘Because cash is king and JPMorgan has much of it.’

Earlier this week, the US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said he was looking into ‘the costs and benefits’ of developing a digital currency.

This revelation comes as China prepares to unleash its own digital yuan which could allow it to dominate the growing cryptocurrency sector.

However, last year President Donald Trump made his distaste for cryptocurrencies clear in a tweet which said: ‘I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behaviour, including drug trade and other illegal activity.’

So we’ve got a long way to go until crypto takes its place in the mainstream – but this in itself is an opportunity, because every rumour about established banks or authorities adopting the digital dosh is likely to spark a price rally.

The overlying Fibonacci retracement indicator shows that the important 61.8% retracement is closer to 11K.

The volume is also an interesting factor. We would want to see the volume rising as the price moves higher so the market needs more confirmation.

Ethereum is steaming ahead today as crypto sentiment skyrockets again.

The ETH/USD pair is trading over 10% higher and could now hit some important resistance zones.

272.00 has provided some support in the past and therefore could act like a resistance area this time out.

Beyond that closer to 360.00 is the next target and if this momentum keeps up it might just get there.

Litecoin price is trading in positive territory by 3.20% in the session on Wednesday.

LTC/USD is breaking out of a temporary four range, a period of consolidation that was seen.

A barrier can be observed at $80, the high of 18 September, before sellers kicked in.

The San Francisco-based exchange said Wednesday in a blog post its new “margin trading” feature provides leverage up to three times or “3x” for individual investors in 23 U.S. states. The leverage is also available to institutional traders in 44 states and nine countries.

The 3x leverage matches Coinbase’s previous margin offering from 2017. Coinbase, led by CEO Brian Armstrong, briefly offered margin trading at the time, but suspended the service later in the year. Executives had been signaling since early 2019 that they were considering reviving the effort.

The resurgent push by Coinbase comes as competition heats up among the world’s crypto exchanges and the biggest players are scrambling to attract customers and transaction volumes with new digital-token listings and features including better trading technology, more leverage and more-secure custody options.

“Margin has been one of our most requested features,” Coinbase said in the blog post.

Several big non-U.S.-based exchanges, including Binance, BitMEX and Deribit, offer leverage of 100 times or more on futures contracts and other derivatives, but many of those offerings are off-limits to American customers. While U.S. traders can get leverage to buy regulated bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts on the CME and Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt division, those venues require special accounts to trade commodities.

Leverage is considered risky in trading because it boosts the chances of losses alongside the enhanced potential for gains.

In an example of how Coinbase’s new offering will work, traders could put $100 down and borrow up to $200 of bitcoin from the exchange for trading, increasing the potential size of the bet to $300 worth of bitcoin. If bitcoin’s price climbs by 33 percent, traders would double their original investment to $200; but if the price falls by 33 percent, they’re wiped out — known as “rek’t” in the slang of the crypto industry.

In the blog post, Coinbase said the borrowed funds can be used to trade other cryptocurrencies, in addition to tripling down on a single digital asset like bitcoin: ” If deployed as part of a responsible trading strategy, margin trading doesn’t just increase your position in a specific trade but can also help diversify your portfolio, allowing you to hedge or arbitrage across multiple positions without depositing additional capital.”

Coinbase is notable because it is one of only a few big cryptocurrency exchanges based in the U.S., submitting to the nation’s strict regulations in exchange for access to customers from the world’s largest economy. Started in the early years of the crypto industry in 2012, Coinbase has long been used by cryptocurrency newcomers as an “on-ramp” into bitcoin and other digital assets from dollars and other government-issued money. The company now claims to have more than 30 million users.

Kraken, the second-biggest U.S. crypto exchange, also based in San Francisco, offers margin trading with up five times leverage, or “5x,” but unlike Coinbase the exchange isn’t licensed to operate in New York.","After playing down the risks of cryptocurrencies at the beginning of Mr. Trump’s term, Mr. Mnuchin said over the summer that they posed a national security threat. He also said that he had “very serious concerns” about Libra, the digital currency that Facebook is developing.

President Trump has also expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies, declaring last year that he was “not a fan” and that their value was volatile and “based on thin air.” He warned at the time that Facebook must seek a banking charter and follow all bank regulations if it wanted to be in the digital currency business.

As part of his effort to more closely police cryptocurrencies, Mr. Mnuchin has been pushing to relocate the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department from the Department of Homeland Security. In the budget proposal the White House released this week, the administration cited the importance of the Treasury Department and Secret Service working together to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies, which it cited as “an emerging threat.”

The United States is also exploring the costs and benefits of developing its own digital currency. While Mr. Mnuchin said on Wednesday that he did not believe one was necessary in the next several years, Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said at a separate Senate hearing that the central bank had been studying what one would look like.

“The benefits would include perhaps greater financial inclusion, lower costs, more convenience,” Mr. Powell said, noting that there would also be a risk for more fraud and reduced privacy. “There’s a lot to weigh and a lot to work on there. Every major central bank in the world right now is doing a deep dive on digital currencies, and we think it is our responsibility to be at the very forefront of knowledge and thinking about a central bank digital currency.”","The Block’s research analyst Matthew Yamamoto pointed out that Canaan’s stock might be underperforming compared to the Chinese stock market

Over 11 million shares have traded hands, compared to the average trading volume of 250,000 prior to today

Canaan, the bitcoin miner manufacturer that's listed on the Nasdaq exchange, saw its stock price soar by more than 80% on Wednesday.

Canaan's stock, CAN, closed at $8.04 per share at the end of the trading day, representing an increase of 82.73%. The stock price began the day's session at $4.42 and hit a high of $8.69. according to data from Yahoo! Finance.

More than 11 million shares traded hands, compared to the average daily trading volume of 250,000 prior to today.

The China-based miner manufacturer's stock performance had been underwhelming since it debuted on Nasdaq in Nov. 2019. Before the market opened today, CAN had declined by 50% since its IPO and at once hit a $4.31 all-time-low.

In an op-ed published this morning, The Block's research analyst Matthew Yamamoto pointed out that Canaan's stock might be underperforming compared to the Chinese market, while the market signal also appears bullish for mining equipment manufacturers

Indeed, as the miners anticipate their mining reward being halved in May, many have been cycling out their old mining rigs, generating high demand for equipment that has a higher hash rate and better energy efficiency produced by manufacturers like Canaan, Bitmain, and MicroBT.

Recently Bitcoin price rally may also encourage more miners to scale their operations by purchasing newer rigs.

""As noted by The Block, mining equipment prices change dynamically based on bitcoin price movements. With bitcoin prices up, this should prove to be a bullish signal for Canaan as their equipment fetches higher price tags,"" Yamamoto wrote in this morning's post.

Meanwhile, shares of publicly-listed mining farms such as Hut 8, Bitfarms, and Argo Blockchain have also risen substantially since the start of the calendar year, climbing by 76%, 90%, and 28% respectively.

However, other market participants take a more precarious view of Canaan's price skyrocket. The coronavirus outbreak in China has impacted most of the China-based mining hardware maker ecosystem, causing delays in their production and shipping schedule.

Given that Canaan is listed on Nasdaq, they have to record their revenue after machines are delivered, meaning that a delay in delivery would lead its recorded quarterly revenue to take a dip as well.

""There’s still a lot of time in the quarter but if they don’t get these units shipped out prior to 3/31 they can’t record deposits etc as revenue under US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). So it doesn’t make sense for why CAN is skyrocketing (unless there is news of them closing a large deal or rumored buyout),"" U.S.-based mining rig broker Blockware Solution CEO Matt D'Souza said.","The blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies or virtual currencies. This is a blockwork methodology that is used to create virtual currencies and use them in the markets. Cryptocurrencies are considered an investment since the value they have depends on the market situation.

This technology is also possible to introduce e-commerce. As they are coins, we can use them as a payment method in the online store.

The blockchain as a payment method in e-commerce

The payment methods available for e-commerce are varied. The choice of payment way depends on the conditions offered by the financial provider, the security it provides, the acceptance that customers have, and other aspects related to technical items.

Being a payment method, it is also possible to include it in e-commerce whose structure is virtual, like cryptocurrencies.

The popularity of cryptocurrencies has changed the mode of buying and selling on the net. The blockchain technology can generate virtual coins whose value depends on the market.

Benefits of integrating cryptocurrencies in the online store

The cryptomonads are a growing trend, increasingly used as a means of investment. If our clients have these currencies, why not allow them to play with them?

The technology behind virtual currencies gives security to this payment system. The blockchain provides reliability and truthfulness to all transactions made electronically.

Types of virtual currencies as a payment method in e-commerce

Among the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin stand out. But there is a wide range of virtual currencies as they are generated independently through algorithms and encryption systems. It is supposed that there are about 1,500 virtual currencies.

What cryptocurrency to use in the online store? Each of them has different characteristics and, most importantly, a different market value. It is advisable to use those best known as it guarantees that there are users who own this currency.

As with the bills or coins with which we pay for the products or services we need, it can also be done with cryptocurrencies. However, not all of them will have the same value. Whether they have a greater or lesser amount will depend on the law of supply and demand for them. Discover the different types of cryptocurrencies that can be used as a payment method in e-commerce.

How many types of cryptocurrencies exist?

Over time, several types of cryptocurrencies have emerged, each of them having their value and characteristics. You likely have a basic concept of what a cryptocurrency is. However, would you be able to differentiate between the different types of cryptocurrencies that can be used as an e-commerce payment method? Because, apart from Bitcoin, which is the first type of cryptocurrency that comes to mind, there are many other alternatives to it, and that is equally interesting.

1) Bitcoin

This type of cryptocurrency is used as an exchange currency on the Internet. There is much e-commerce that already supports it as a payment method, apart from the traditional ones: credit or debit card, bank transfer, cash on delivery, Paypal.

One of the great advantages of using cryptocurrencies as a method of payment for e-commerce is that it is a very secure system, with the codes used in transactions illegible.

2) Ethereum

This type of cryptocurrency is characterized in that it has been programmed in such a way that it complements Bitcoin. It is an operating system that allows us to go beyond purely financial or economic use, and users can create applications based on virtual currencies. For example: create custom crowdfunding platforms, digital companies, etc.

The currency itself is called Ether, while Ethereum refers to the operating system that controls said cryptocurrency. And, with it, users can make payments, either to other people or businesses, as well as execute operations reliably.

3) Litecoin

This type of cryptocurrency is another of the e-commerce payment methods that have emerged. One of the main advantages of this type of cryptocurrency is that transaction confirmation times are faster than with any other cryptocurrency. Also, its operation is very simple, so it is ideal for those users who must move small amounts of money and quickly.

Conclusion: Bitcoin is the most famous coin of all because it was the first to appear on the market. It is also the most used worldwide and therefore the most interesting for our e-commerce. Some platforms facilitate the integration of bitcoin in online stores with the objective that the client can undermine their currencies through the purchase of online products.","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) should – but won’t – clarify how taxes are levied on cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency transactions in the U.S., the government’s top auditing institution said Wednesday.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO), a U.S. Congress watchdog, published a report in response to a request from Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), evaluating the IRS’s existing approach and public guidance surrounding cryptocurrencies.

The office had three recommendations for the U.S. tax collector, as well as an additional related recommendation for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department. Notably, one of its recommendations was to clarify that some of the IRS’s recent guidance is not binding or authoritative – and the agency rejected this recommendation.

“Part of the 2019 guidance is not authoritative because it was not published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB). IRS has stated that only guidance published in the IRB is IRS’s authoritative interpretation of the law. IRS did not make clear to taxpayers that this part of the guidance is not authoritative and is subject to change,” the report said.

Wednesday’s GAO report was reported earlier by Bloomberg Tax.

The IRS’s 2019 guidance answered some questions around the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies but “prompted new concerns among virtual currency stakeholders,” the report said. Complying with tax requirements may be difficult, and the GAO report suspects that trading activity may be underreported due to a lack of clarity around what should be reported.

A further complication comes from foreign account reporting requirements, the GAO said. Specifically, it is unclear whether foreign bank account reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reports apply to cryptocurrencies.

Indeed, even the wording around cryptocurrencies is vague. The IRS and other elements of the federal government have been referring to cryptocurrencies as virtual currencies, but as noted by Coin Center’s Jerry Brito, the term can also refer to digital monies used in video games (UPDATE: The IRS modified this language to exclude video game currencies late Wednesday).

The term “convertible virtual currency” may more specifically refer to cryptocurrencies, and has appeared in White House publications and IRS documentation (though not its 2019 FAQ).

The GAO recommended the IRS add a note saying its 2019 FAQs are not binding guidance, clarify third-party reporting requirements and clarify the reporting requirements around FATCA. The GAO also recommended FinCEN, in coordination with the IRS, share more information about applying foreign account reporting requirements under the BSA.

The IRS agreed with the second recommendation but disagreed with the first and third, the GAO report said. FinCEN also agreed to share more information.

“We continue to believe that including such a statement would provide more transparency and help taxpayers understand the nature of the information provided in the FAQs,” the GAO said.","North Korea is stepping up mining of the privacy coin monero as the regime continues its efforts to circumvent sanctions.

U.S. cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said in a report Sunday that network traffic for monero (XMR) mining that had originated from North Korean IP ranges had increased by “at least tenfold” since May 2019, making it the most popular digital asset to mine and surpassing the regime’s mining activity for bitcoin (BTC).

The report attributes the changing preference for monero to the fact XMR mining can take place on non-specialized machines, such as conventional computers, which lowers operating costs and negates the need to import mining rigs from abroad.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Monero transactions are also anonymous, making it easier for North Korea to “evade attempts to track funds” as well as circumvent sanctions imposed on the regime by the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, according to Recorded Future.

“We assess that cryptocurrencies are a valuable tool for North Korea as an independent, loosely regulated source of revenue generation, but also as a means for moving and using illicitly obtained funds,” its report reads.

Recorded Future’s report said the regime’s mining activity had been obfuscated with proxy IP addresses, meaning analysts could not determine the share of the XMR hashrate for which North Korea was responsible.

Although a U.N. study previously suggested a branch of the North Korean military was responsible for the regime’s crypto mining activity, Record Future’s study was not able to say which entity was responsible based on the data it collected.

Monero has been used by North Korea since at least August 2017 when operatives involved in the WannaCry attack exchanged extorted bitcoin into monero. The regime’s bitcoin mining activity has remained relatively static over the past two years, according to the report.

Monero is the preferred cryptocurrency for many illicit and criminal organizations. A Japanese cybersecurity firm reported this week the mysterious hacking group Outlaw had developed a range of sophisticated crypto mining bots that can infiltrate enterprise computer systems to covertly mine monero."
2020-02-13,"Larry Harmon was arrested earlier this week for allegedly participating in a money-laundering conspiracy worth more than $300 million in cryptocurrency involving darknet marketplace AlphaBay. However, the family of the Coin Ninja CEO claims he was never involved with AlphaBay.

Harmon’s case raises pressing questions about developer liability in the crypto industry.

In addition to the crypto media site Coin Ninja, Harmon created the bitcoin (BTC) mixer Helix, which sends transactions out in mixed batches so individual payments are harder to trace. In its indictment, Department of Justice prosecutors refer to Helix as a “money transmitting and money laundering business.”

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

“Helix enabled customers, for a fee, to send bitcoins to designated recipients in a manner which was designed to conceal and obfuscate the source or owner of the bitcoins,” the indictment continues. “This type of service is commonly referred to as a bitcoin ‘mixer’ or ‘tumbler.’”

In a statement Thursday, Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski made the department’s views on bitcoin mixers clear. “This indictment underscores that seeking to obscure virtual currency transactions in this way is a crime,” he said.

Harmon’s brother and Coin Ninja coworker, Gary Harmon, said Helix did not directly partner with AlphaBay and the darknet market recommended the mixer without Larry’s permission or input. (Helix shut down in 2017; AlphaBay was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in July 2017.)

Since the arrest, Larry’s wife Margot has received threatening phone calls and texts from unknown numbers saying the harasser knows the location of her home and she is no longer safe there, Gary told CoinDesk in an interview.

“Now our family is getting threatened because the FBI decided to tell the world that there might be money hidden with us somehow,” Gary said. “They have no proof of this and are now putting our family in danger.”

Gary said all his brother’s assets have been frozen and he was denied bail over flight-risk concerns. As such, the family has started a GoFundMe campaign for its expenses during the trial.

”Our address is on it,” Margot Harmon said of the indictment. “At the bond hearing they alleged that he may have had some more bitcoin. So that put us at risk.”

Gary said the authorities have already confiscated all of his brother’s hardware wallets and Margot doesn’t have any more bitcoin at home.

The Department of Justice says it worked with the Belize National Police Department to search Harmon’s timeshare in Belize as well. Gary said the police “trashed” both of his brother’s homes.

Major implications

Many bitcoin experts are concerned this could establish a precedent where simply creating a bitcoin mixer is seen, in itself, as a money-laundering conspiracy.

Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo tweeted that if this accusation was upheld by the federal court in Washington, D.C., it would be “the beginning of the end.”

Margot said her husband was interested in privacy technology, not criminal activity. She offered the example of queer people who may want to purchase porn or sex products without judgment from conservative family members.

“Larry has always been an advocate for privacy. He doesn’t know any bad guys from the dark web. He just wanted to help people have better privacy,” she told CoinDesk Thursday. “It’s a basic right we are guaranteed in the Constitution.”

The courts may decide in this case if the Fourth Amendment actually relates to bitcoin when it says Americans have the right to be “secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” Whether or not this includes a right to privacy, generally speaking, is a hotly debated issue among legal experts.

In May, the Dutch Financial Criminal Investigative Service seized and shut down the popular mixing service Bestmixer.io but other companies, such as the privacy-centric bitcoin wallet Wasabi, have built-in mixers as the backbone of their business strategy. These bitcoin wallet startups typically offer non-custodial mixers, unlike the custodial mixer Helix. The Canadian venture fund Cypherpunk Holdings is invested in both Wasabi’s parent company and Samourai Wallet, which also offers a mixing service. The public policy group Coin Center argued non-custodial mixers should not be subject to regulation because they offer user-hosted software tools. Only time will tell if the court agrees this reduces the developer’s liability.","Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Gives Testimony on Cryptocurrency, New Regulations Rolling Out Soon

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin gave his testimony on cryptocurrency before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday. Mnuchin said crypto is a “crucial area” that the Treasury has spent a lot of time on. He also talked about stablecoins and announced that new crypto regulations focusing on transparency will be rolled out soon.

Mnuchin on Cryptocurrency

Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday regarding President Donald Trump’s budget for the fiscal year 2021 released earlier this week. During the hearing, Senator Todd Young asked Mnuchin several questions about cryptocurrency and the challenges it creates for the U.S. government in various ways.

“Proponents of crypto believe it can benefit the everyday consumer by lowering transaction costs for online purchases and increasing protection from identity theft and breaking down various financial barriers,” Young began. “How does your department, Mr. Secretary, plan to respond to this rapidly evolving technology of cryptocurrency and other digital assets?”

Emphasizing that the Treasury is supportive of the proposals, including those concerning cryptocurrency, outlined in Trump’s new budget, Mnuchin replied:

We’re spending a lot of time on the issue of cryptocurrencies and digital payment systems. It’s a crucial area.

While asking Mnuchin questions on cryptocurrencies, Young referenced Trump’s budget proposals for added crypto oversight and the IRS’ efforts, including increased crypto-related enforcement and additional guidance for cryptocurrency. Earlier this week, the White House released the government’s budget for the fiscal year 2021 containing two proposals affecting the crypto industry. One was to return the Secret Service to the Department of Treasury and the other was a request for more funding for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to enhance its work on regulating the crypto sector.

Mnuchin on Cryptos, Bitcoin, Stablecoins, New Crypto Regulations Coming Soon

The Treasury secretary noted that “there’s a lot of different things that get grouped together into this one area [cryptocurrency].” He proceeded to address three key areas: pure cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Young pointed out that there’s a concern that cryptocurrencies can be used to operate outside of the current international financial system.

On the subject of stablecoins, Mnuchin said: “we do think the technology can be used to reduce payment processing quite considerably, particularly for small dollar payments cross-border.” Regarding a central bank digital currency, the Treasury secretary said both Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and him agree that the U.S. does not need to consider issuing a digital dollar right now “but could consider again down the road.” He added:

On pure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and there are others, we want to make sure that these are not used as the equivalent of secret bank accounts.

The Treasury secretary further revealed: “We are working with FinCEN and we will be rolling out new regulations to be very clear on greater transparency so that law enforcement can see where the money is going and that this isn’t used for money laundering.”

Mnuchin’s testimony followed one by Powell who gave his testimony before the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee regarding the country’s monetary system and the state of the economy on Tuesday. The Fed chairman answered a number of questions regarding cryptocurrencies, including the digital dollar’s progress. He was urged to speed up the work on it since China claims that it will be rolling out a digital yuan soon. Powell also admitted that Facebook’s Libra project was a wake-up call for the Fed.

He noted that cryptocurrency was a “crucial area” for the Treasury Department to examine, and said:

We are working with FinCEN and we will be rolling out new regulations to be very clear on greater transparency so that law enforcement can see where the money is going and that this isn’t used for money laundering.

While we haven’t seen any draft proposals at this point, Mnuchin’s call for greater transparency—a euphemism for intrusive surveillance— definitely got our attention. One of the real risks of cryptocurrency is that it could become a technology of financial surveillance, especially in the case of open ledger protocols such as Bitcoin. These are cryptocurrencies that create unerasable, public lists of transactions that, should a pseudonymous wallet ever be associated with an individual person, can potentially link together a huge number of financial transactions. And those transactions can be deeply revealing, pointing to everything from your friend network to your sexual interests to your political affiliations. Indeed, researchers have already proven that this is not a theoretical risk.

Law enforcement has long been interested in having access to financial records during investigations. But law enforcement access isn’t the only value, let alone the most important value, regulators need to solve for. There are already laws that regulate financial institutions that hold and exchange funds (including cryptocurrencies) for consumers, and offer pathways for law enforcement seeking to learn about transactions. Before adopting new regulations in this space, it’s vital that the U.S. Treasury and others first ask:

Do existing laws and regulations already provide access for law enforcement? If not, where specifically are there shortcomings, and how significant of an issue is that?

How will any future proposals ensure that privacy and freedom of association are preserved?

How might proposed regulations impact privacy-enhancing blockchain projects that are under development?

EFF has been watching the evolution of privacy-enhancing technologies such as privacy coins and decentralized exchanges. While not widely used today, these technologies hold the potential to bring some of the privacy-preserving attributes all of us already enjoy with cash into the digital world. It’s vital that future regulation doesn’t threaten these innovations before they’ve had a chance to find a foothold.

We appreciate that some federal officials are highlighting a need for privacy when commenting on cryptocurrency policy. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spoke to the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services. When asked whether the Fed had visibility into China’s efforts to develop a state-run digital currency, Powell noted that China is “in a completely different institutional context. For example, the idea of having a ledger where you know everybody’s payments, that’s not something that would be particularly attractive in the United States context. It’s not a problem in China.”

While we don’t share Powell’s impression that financial surveillance in China is “not a problem,” we appreciate that he understands that Americans won’t stand for a system of complete financial surveillance.

As regulators and lawmakers consider the challenges we face around cryptocurrencies, we urge them to work closely with the human rights and civil liberties communities. We are concerned about a future in which every financial transaction is captured and saved forever, creating a honey pot for malicious hackers and law enforcement as well as a chilling government shadow over every purchase or donation. For thousands of years, societies around the world have thrived with privacy-preserving cash. Rather than be the generation that kills cash, we encourage the Treasury Department and other federal officials to think about ways we can bring the best attributes of cash into our digital future.","Expect the Treasury Department to roll out new regulations on cryptocurrencies later this year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday.

“We are about to roll out some significant new requirements,” Mnuchin told the Senate Finance Committee, according to several media reports. “We want to make sure that technology moves forward; on the other hand, we want to make sure cryptocurrencies aren’t used for the equivalent of old Swiss secret number banking.”

Mnuchin supplied no details on what the new regulations might entail. The Trump administration has recently expressed concern that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are being used to execute illegal transactions and evade U.S. sanctions. The regulations being developed would increase transparency to deter money laundering and other illegal uses for cryptocurrency.

The U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) produced guidance in 2019, followed by an advisory, to assist financial institutions in identifying and reporting suspicious activity around cryptocurrency transactions.

“Simply stated, those who accept and transfer value, by any means, must comply with our regulations, and the criminal misuse of any methodology remains our fundamental concern,” FinCEN Director Kenneth Blanco said last year.

As for a U.S.-backed cryptocurrency, Mnuchin and Fed chair Jerome Powell gave conflicting accounts on the Trump administration’s interest in developing a U.S. digital currency.

Mnuchin told the Senate Finance Committee he did not believe one would be necessary for several years. But Powell, speaking Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee, said every major central bank in the world is examining the benefits and drawbacks to developing their own digital currencies. The Fed is doing its due diligence as well, he said.

“We think it is our responsibility to be at the very forefront of knowledge and thinking about a central bank digital currency,” he said.","LONDON (Reuters) - Crypto analysts are split on whether bitcoin’s rise this year is driven by unique factors or is just its latest bout of volatility. But many agree on one factor: an upcoming cut to the supply of bitcoin.

Bitcoin has soared by almost half this year, to more than $10,000, for the first time since October. On Tuesday it hit its highest in five months.

The cryptocurrency’s 11-year history is replete with fast ascents and equally rapid plunges. In late 2017, it rose three and a half times in just 35 days to reach almost $20,000. It then slumped 70% in seven weeks.

Such wild and often inexplicable swings are why bitcoin faces a struggle to become a functioning currency.

This time around, some market players point to a confluence of drivers not seen before. Arcane tech factors, expectations for mainstream acceptance and macroeconomic trends are leading markets to look again at bitcoin’s worth, they say.

“You can argue that there is a fresh valuation going on,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, a stockbroker that oversees assets worth $71 billion.

Most fundamentally, many cite growing demand for bitcoin before its latest “halving” -- a 50% cut in the production of the cryptocurrency due in May that is one of the few observable events known to materially impact price.

A rule written into bitcoin’s underlying code slashes the number of new coins awarded to the miners behind the global supply of bitcoin.

In the year after the two previous halvings, in November 2012 and July 2016, bitcoin rose around by 80 times and four times respectively. The exact proportion of the gains caused by the halving is unclear.

“It’s a rare observable factor - if you look at previous events, in each case there has been a quite clear and discernable spike in the value of bitcoin,” said Windsor Holden, a payments consultant who tracks crypto and blockchain.

GRAPHIC - Bitcoin's Halving:

“HYPE CYCLE”

But others doubt bitcoin’s latest rally is underpinned by anything more substantial than the previous booms.

“The recent rally has been driven by the usual hype cycle that we have very reliably seen every two to three years,” said Michel Rauchs, author of several Cambridge university studies on cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech.

“We have these mini-bubbles, and the momentum that it creates - bitcoin first, then these other coins. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.”

Major cryptocurrencies that tend to move in correlation with bitcoin have also gained this year. Ethereum has more than doubled; Ripple’s XRP token is up over 75%.

Other factors cited for the rally, such as greater demand for assets uncorrelated to mainstream markets following the U.S. killing of an Iranian military commander last month, are also questionable.

Bitcoin’s “safety” characteristic is unclear. It has regularly fallen in times of geopolitical stress in recent years.

Looser central bank policy is also given as a reason bets on riskier assets. But that link is hard to prove, too. Bitcoin has fallen during previous spells of easy money.

DIGITAL DOLLAR?

Also widely cited are expectations that cryptocurrencies will go mainstream, as central banks step up their research into digital currencies after Facebook’s push to offer its Libra coin. Some, such as China’s, are getting closer to issuing their own coins.

And in comments that traders said stoked buying in bitcoin, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that the Fed was “working hard” on the issue, while it remained undecided on any digital dollar.

Central bank interest is also problematic as a reason for bitcoin’s rise, Rauchs said.

“People tend to mix up and conflate these different concepts that are actually fundamentally different from one another,” he said. “This creates a bubble where you conflate everything together and everything appreciates.”

Still, in the short term, crypto traders interviewed by Reuters said, the cut to the supply of bitcoin was likely to loom largest for investors.

“Things are aligning,” said Jamie Farquhar, portfolio manager at crypto firm NKB Group. “But the real thing that people are looking at is the halving.”

Akron Beacon Journal

An international tale of money laundering, cryptocurrency and the dark web of illegal guns and drugs may have deep roots in Greater Akron.

A Bath, Ohio, resident with a bitcoin-focused business in downtown Akron was secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., in December for conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and transmitting money without a license, court records show.

Larry Dean Harmon, who is in his 30s, was arrested in Akron last Thursday and the indictment was unsealed. If convicted, Harmon could face 14 to 17½ years in prison, according to court records.

Federal prosecutors in Ohio asked a judge to keep Harmon in custody, saying he is a flight risk, a jet-set multimillionaire with cryptocurrency he can access anywhere in the world.

On Wednesday, a federal judge granted prosecutors’ request to hold Harmon and remanded him to custody in Washington, D.C.

His lawyer, who is based in Houston, Texas, did not immediately return a message.

In Akron, Harmon does business in an office on the floors above a restaurant at the corner of East Market and High streets.

His Akron company, Coin Ninja, aims to accelerate global use of bitcoin as currency. It does not appear to be tied up in the legal action against Harmon.

The indictment, and subsequent court documents filed by prosecutors in Cleveland, focus on Grams and Helix, two other defunct businesses they say Harmon ran.

Grams in 2014 was described as the “Google of the dark net” by “Wired” magazine.

The dark web is a hidden part of the internet that isn’t indexed by conventional search engines.

The defunct site made it as easy for internet shoppers around the world to find and buy illegal guns and drugs on the deep web as it is for the rest of us to find books and sweatshirts on the regular web.

Grams’ online companion service was called Helix. Federal prosecutors said in court records that Helix was a bitcoin money-laundering service that, for a fee, let customers send anonymous bitcoins.

“Harmon advertised Helix to customers on the Darknet as a way to conceal transactions from law enforcement,” prosecutors said in court records.

And it was a profitable venture.

Helix laundered at least 354,468 bitcoins, the equivalent to about $311 million, federal prosecutors allege.

Harmon charged a 2.5% fee, which would be about 8,900 bitcoins worth close to $80 million at today’s prices, prosecutors said.

Harmon shuttered Grams and Helix, court records said, after a federal crackdown on the dark web.","Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Are 'Like a Giant Garbage Dumpster,' Says Minneapolis Federal Reserve President

The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, said on Tuesday that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are “like a giant garbage dumpster.” He would rather his one-year-old daughter have a low yielding Treasury bond than a bitcoin, emphasizing that all that’s emerging from the crypto world “is burning garbage.”

Bitcoin and Crypto ‘a Giant Garbage Dumpster’

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari talked about cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, at a Town Hall event in Kashkari, Montana, on Tuesday. He took office as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in January 2016.

Washington Companies CEO Larry Simkins moderated the Q&A session at the event. He asked Kashkari: “Your daughter is a year old and if I want to buy her a gift, would you prefer I give her a low yielding Treasury bond or a bitcoin?” The Minneapolis Federal Reserve president laughed and then replied, “Between those two, I think low yield treasury bond.” Kashkari elaborated:

The bitcoin and cryptocurrency, it’s basically, it’s like a giant garbage dumpster. The reason that the dollar has value is because the U.S. government has a legal monopoly on producing the dollar.

He continued: “If you go in your basement and start photocopying your dollar bills, the Secret Service will come and knock on your door and arrest you. Only the U.S. government has the authority to produce dollars, scarcity is in part what makes them valuable.”

Thousands of Garbage Coins

Kashkari further said: “Well, the virtual currency, cryptocurrency world, there are thousands of these garbage coins out there, thousands of them literally, people have been fleeced for tens of billions of dollars, and finally, the SEC is getting involved in cracking down on this, but people are just getting fleeced by nonsense.”

“So I can create Neelcoin, you can create Larrycoin,” he told Simkins. “I can create something that looks just like bitcoin … it’s just a giant garbage dumpster at this point,” the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president opined, concluding:

Maybe five years from now, or 10 years from now, or 20 years from now, something useful will emerge from this but so far all that’s emerging is burning garbage.

“So no, don’t give my daughter bitcoin,” Kashkari reiterated to Simkins.

The statements by the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president echo President Donald Trump’s view on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Trump tweeted in July: “I am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” He emphasized that the dollar is the only real currency in the U.S.

Wells Fargo has invested $5 million into U.K. start-up Elliptic, which helps banks manage the risks associated with being exposed to cryptocurrencies. The London-based firm has become known for its analysis tools, which it sells to some of the world's largest cryptocurrency platforms — including Binance and Circle — to help them find and block illicit digital currency transactions. For instance, the company's technology was able to uncover a terrorist group using bitcoin to finance its operations by tracking suspicious transactions on the cryptocurrency's digital ledger known as the blockchain. It then flagged this to its clients so they could cut off the funds. But the firm, founded in 2013, has been increasingly working with financial institutions to get them on board with its so-called Discovery platform, which helps banks identify whether clients' funds are passing through cryptocurrency platforms without the appropriate compliance checks in place. ""If they see payments going between their customers and one of a long list of crypto entities, they can understand more about who that entity is and whether it's something they should be concerned about,"" Elliptic co-founder and CEO James Smith told CNBC in an interview.

The aim of Discovery is to give banks a sense of their exposure to crypto-assets through their customers' transactions and identify whether there are any money laundering risks. The investment into Elliptic from Wells Fargo's venture unit, Wells Fargo Strategic Capital, is an extension of the start-up's $23 million Series B funding round announced in September. The additional investment brings the company's total money raised to over $40 million. Elliptic didn't disclose its valuation. Smith said the fact that Wells Fargo was backing the company shows banks are ""interested in how we can help them understand and manage risk that relates to crypto."" ""More and more financial institutions realize even if they don't touch crypto themselves, they are adjacent to crypto. They are exposed to crypto risk and have a responsibility to understand what the risk is and how to manage it."" He said it also reflects an improving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, citing legislation such as newly introduced anti-money laundering rules from the European Union. He also highlighted a regulatory framework from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that includes crypto assets. The FATF is an intergovernmental organization tackling dirty money.","The Internal Revenue Service could be doing more to help taxpayers who own Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency to comply with their tax obligations, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office.

The report , issued Wednesday by the GAO, acknowledged that the IRS has provided some guidance in 2014 and 2019 on what it refers to as “virtual currency.” In 2014, it issued Notice 2014-21 , which said the IRS would treat Bitcoin and other virtual currencies as property for federal income tax purposes and offered some examples of how long-standing tax principles could be applied to transactions involving virtual currency. Despite dramatic increases, decreases and volatility in the prices of various forms of digital currency such as Bitcoin, it took another five years before the IRS responded to the demand for further guidance in the form of frequently answered questions on virtual currency transactions.

However, part of the 2019 FAQ guidance isn’t considered authoritative because it was not published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. The IRS has said that only guidance published in the IRB is its authoritative interpretation of the tax laws. The IRS didn’t make it clear to taxpayers that this part of the guidance isn’t authoritative and is subject to change.

The IRS has seen the need for taxpayers to report on their crypto trades and holdings, and for this tax season it added a question to the top of Schedule 1 of Form 1040 asking, “At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”

The current IRS guidance says that using virtual currency can produce taxable capital gains, but the GAO report said the IRS could do more to help taxpayers comply. Financial institutions already report information about investment sales to the IRS and taxpayers, to make both aware of any taxable income. But while some cryptocurrency transactions are reported, far from all of them are.

Taxpayers are required to report and pay taxes on income from cryptocurrency use, but the IRS still has limited data on tax compliance for virtual currency. The information returns filed by third parties, such as financial institutions, generally don’t require filers to indicate whether the income or transactions they report involved cryptocurrency. The IRS launched a virtual currency compliance campaign in 2018 and worked with other agencies on criminal investigations. Last July, the service started mailing more than 10,000 letters to taxpayers with cryptocurrency activity telling them about their potential tax obligations.

However, the IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, also known as FinCEN, haven’t clearly and publicly explained when and if the requirements for reporting financial assets held in foreign countries apply to virtual currencies, the GAO pointed out. Clarifying and providing publicly available information about those requirements could improve the data available for tax enforcement and make it less likely that taxpayers will file reports that are not legally required.

The GAO recommended the IRS clarify that part of its 2019 guidance isn’t authoritative and take steps to increase information reporting, and that FinCEN and the IRS address how foreign asset reporting laws apply to virtual currency. The IRS agreed with the GAO’s recommendation on information reporting, but it disagreed with the other two suggestions, arguing that a disclaimer statement is unnecessary and it’s premature to address virtual currency foreign reporting.

“We continue to engage a broad spectrum of external stakeholders for feedback on how the IRS might balance taxpayer service with proper regulatory enforcement of digital assets, including virtual currency,” wrote Sunita Lough, deputy commissioner for services and enforcement at the IRS, in response to the report. “The wide variety of currency exchanges and digital assets pose a challenge to issuing guidance on specific circumstances, but the guidance issued by the IRS to date illustrates how longstanding tax principles associated with the sale, exchange or disposition of property can apply to virtual currency.”

For its part, the GAO said it believes a disclaimer would increase transparency and the IRS could clarify foreign reporting without waiting for future developments in the industry. FinCEN, however, agreed with the GAO's recommendation. “FinCEN will coordinate with the IRS to determine the best approach to provide clarity to the public regarding the application of the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts to virtual currency,” wrote FinCEN director Kenneth Blanco in response to the report. “Currently, the FBAR regulations do not define virtual currency held in an offshore account as a type of reportable account.”

The IRS recently removed wording from its FAQ page about the applicability of the rules to virtual currency used in games like Fortnite and Roblox, according to Bloomberg Tax, with an IRS official saying the inclusion of the in-game currency was an error.

2020-02-14,"Bitcoin investors speculate the upcoming halving could send prices skyrocketing to $90,000 or higher.

To the operators of high-speed computers used to mine for bitcoin, the halving looks more like a doubling — of costs.

In a new report, the crypto-focused research firm TradeBlock estimates the average cost to mine a single bitcoin (BTC) could jump to $12,525 after the halving, expected in May. That’s nearly double the average cost of $6,851 now. Essentially, miners will have to run twice the number of computations, with a corresponding increase in electricity usage, to get the same amount of bitcoin they’re getting now.

The estimated cost is also well above the current market price of about $10,300, providing an illustration of how the halving could turn the crypto-mining industry’s profitability upside-down if market prices don’t rise.

The halving was programmed into bitcoin’s original network programming as a a bulwark against inflation when the cryptocurrency was created just over a decade ago. The idea was a predictable and ever-slowing pace of new supply of the cryptocurrency would help to stabilize bitcoin’s purchasing power — a contrast with government-backed currencies that can often be printed at will by human central bankers.

What’s happening now is a lesson on the emerging economics of bitcoin’s commodity-like market cycles: Crypto mining companies are scrambling to get ready for the halving by upgrading their fleets of computers to include next-generation processor chips that are faster and more energy-efficient.

Researchers at the U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase have described bitcoin miners’ average cost as the cryptocurrency’s “intrinsic value.” Think of it like oil drillers’ cost to pump an incremental barrel: If a drop in the market price renders oil unprofitable, many drillers will shut off the tap until prices rise again.

TradeBlock’s estimated post-halving cost of $12,525 assumes the network’s current processing power, known as the “hash rate,” stays at its current level. The analysis also assumes an electricity price of 6 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, which is higher than the roughly 2 cents that some big crypto-mining firms say they can get from the local grid or through wholesale purchasing agreements.

Another quibble-prone assumption is that roughly 30 percent of mining computers will “transition” to the latest technology, while 70 percent “remain on older devices,” according to TradeBlock. Some crypto-industry executives say it’s more likely many of the older-generation mining computers or “rigs” will become uneconomical after the halving, leaving faster machines to dominate the network.

Whatever the case, the threshold bears monitoring closely for bitcoin investors, says John Todaro, TradeBlock’s director of digital currency research.","The US Department of Justice launches first legal case against a Bitcoin mixer Watch Now

US authorities have arrested and charged an Ohio man for running a ""Bitcoin mixer"" service on the dark web that helped criminals disguise the origin of Bitcoin transactions.

Larry Harmon, 36, of Akron, Ohio, stands accused in a three-count indictment [PDF] for operating Helix, an online website located on the dark web.

The Bitcoin blockchain is a public database. In many cases, purchases of new Bitcoin funds aquired by a user can sometimes be linked to a credit card, bank account, or PayPal account.

Helix functioned as a Bitcoin mixer (Bitcoin tumbler), a type of service that takes funds from a user, split the sum into small parts, and using thousands of transactions, sends and reassembles the original funds at a new Bitcoin address, in an effort to hide the original funds under a cloud of micro-transactions.

""The sole purpose of Harmon's operation was to conceal criminal transactions from law enforcement on the Darknet, and because of our growing expertise in this area, he could not make good on that promise,"" Don Fort, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation, said today in a DOJ press release.

""Working in tandem with other sites, he sought to be the 'go-to' money launderer on the Darknet, but our investigators once again played the role of criminal disrupters, unraveling the interlinked web from one tentacle to another,"" Fort said.

Harmon also operated ""Grams""

According to DOJ documents, Harmon ran Helix as a secondary project attached to his primary service called Grams, a search engine that aggregated listings from multiple dark web drugs-related marketplaces.

Grams allowed users to search for drugs and find the cheapest offers in their areas. Helix was provided as a way for potential buyers to hide their identity when buying products.

The DOJ says Harmon operated Helix since 2014 and helped launder more than 350,000 bitcoins, valued at around $300 million at the time of their transactions -- valued $3.5 billion today.

Investigators say that as the service grew, Harmon also partnered with other dark web services. According to the indictment, Harmon joined forces with AlphaBay, the biggest dark web marketplace for illegal products at the time, with AlphaBay recommending Helix to its users as a safe Bitcoin tumbling option.

Officials said Harmon charged a 2.5% fee for all Helix tumbling operations. Besides wanting to put Harmon away for long years in prison, the DOJ is also seeking forfeiture over three real estate properties they believe the suspect bought using the illegal funds he earned via Helix.

BitMixer shut down anticipating today's charges

This is the first case the DOJ has brought against a Bitcoin mixer.

In July 2017, BitMixer, the largest Bitcoin mixer on the internet at the time, shut down abruptly. In a message posted on its website and cryptocurrency forums, BitMixer operators said they were shutting down because they realized Bitcoin transactions were not fully anonymous.

At the time, they anticipated that Bitcoin mixing services would eventually become illegal as various threat intel companies were making headway with technologies that could track transactions across the vast Bitcoin blockchain.

BitMixer's sudden realization and shutdown came a week after Google and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis announced they tracked Bitcoin transactions used for ransomware payments. Some of the ransomware funds had been moved through Bitcoin mixers.

The DOJ eventually ended up shutting down BTC-e, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange portal, through which 95% of all ransomware payments were being handled at the time.

Three days later after the BTC-e takedown, BitMixer saw the writing on the wall and shut down as well.

BitMixer owners were never charged, but they didn't operate by advertising their services to cybercriminals and drug dealers, being considered a clean service and operating on the public internet.

On the other hand, Helix had close ties with AlphaBay, which law enforcement shut down in the summer of 2017.","BlockFi is a fintech startup offering interest-bearing bitcoin accounts, crypto-backed fiat loans, and zero-fee trading. People must really like those features: Last year, the company's revenue grew over 20x.

And yesterday, BlockFi announced a $30 million Series B. Prominent cryptocurrency investors participated in the round, including the Winklevii's investment firm. This wasn't a surprise: When the company raised its Series A in August, CEO Zac Prince told me he was already thinking about raising again.

BlockFi plans to launch a crypto-rewards credit card, mobile app, and roboadvisor. Maybe it can hold off until it raises a Series C in two weeks.

Bottom line: BlockFi has grown revenue, assets, and its cap table by offering traditional financial services to cryptocurrency owners. Now it plans to draw in more users by expanding product offerings.

Tax regulations implemented even before dedicated legislation has been adopted have hit Brazilian cryptocurrency exchanges. Digital asset brokers failing to comply with the new reporting requirements face fines and the stricter rules are hurting smaller platforms, which are shutting down due to dwindling trading volumes.

Exchanges Struggle With Compliance Costs and Diminishing Returns

One of the affected exchanges, Acesso Bitcoin, points to the current situation created by the new regulations as the main reason for its decision to quit. “After the Federal Revenue Service introduced these rules we noticed a significant decrease in the traded volume,” said cofounder Pedro Nunes, quoted by the crypto news outlet Portal do Bitcoin. “We also feel that the market has cooled off for smaller exchanges,” he added.

Porto Alegre-headquartered Acesso Bitcoin recently advised clients on how to proceed with withdrawing their funds. Anyone who keeps bitcoin core (BTC) with the exchange should transfer the coins to a private wallet or another exchange. Customers who have balances in Brazilian real (BRL) can withdraw the money at any time in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable when the platform operated normally.

Latoex, formerly known as the São Paulo-based platform E-juno, is another cryptocurrency exchange that’s shutting down due to difficulties meeting the tax authority’s new requirements. Last week, the closure was confirmed by Diego Velasques, chief executive officer of Latoex Capital, the investment arm of the exchange which separated from the crypto trading platform in December.

Latoex (Latin America Token Exchange) is now looking to sell its assets to other companies and return remaining funds to its clients. The asset manager is also trying to reverse a suspension order issued by CVM, Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission, which threatened to impose a 100,000 Brazilian rial ($23,000) fine in case the group does not comply with its decision.

Brazil is yet to adopt legislation tailored to regulate the crypto space. In the absence of a dedicated law, interactions in the industry are now largely governed by Normative Instruction 1888 issued by Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), the Department of Federal Revenue. The substatutory act was published in May and entered into force on Aug. 1, 2019.

According to the instruction, all transactions carried out through Brazilian crypto exchanges must be reported to the RFB, regardless of the amount traded. Noncompliant brokers and companies that present inaccurate information will be fined. Failure to file a monthly declaration would cost them between 500 and 1,500 rial ($350) per violation. But even without fines, compliance requires additional investments as the whole sector is trying to adapt to the new regulations.

Three Crypto Bills Stuck in the National Congress

Multiple proposals to comprehensively regulate the crypto industry and place it under the oversight of the Central Bank of Brazil have been filed in both houses of the country’s National Congress. The main draft so far, Bill 2303/2015 which was introduced to the Chamber of Deputies almost five years ago, was archived in 2018 and later placed back on the agenda in March 2019. A special commission has been appointed to analyze it and make revisions, if necessary.

Two other bills, PL 3825/2019 and PL 3949/2019, are currently under review in the Senate. Both aim to establish general rules for the cryptocurrency market with particular focus on implementing regulations for digital asset brokers and investor protection measures. No specific time frame has been set for the enactment of either of these pieces of legislation which are still subject to deliberation.

The new challenges for crypto companies in Brazil mirror some regulatory developments European businesses have to deal with. Stricter due diligence requirements were introduced in the EU with the bloc’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) that member-states had to transpose into national law by Jan. 10, 2020. Several crypto startups have already closed down or relocated to other jurisdictions in order to preserve their business models and keep their customer base. The European Commission is still working on a comprehensive proposal to regulate crypto-related activities in the union.

The University of Wyoming has received a gift of $500,000 in Ada cryptocurrency from IOHK (Input Output, iohk.io), a leading international technology company. The gift supports the development of blockchain technology.

The gift is the largest cryptocurrency gift to UW and is among the largest cryptocurrency gifts to a public university. UW is one of the first universities to accept cryptocurrency donations.

“The potential real-world applications of blockchain are limitless, and IOHK’s donation of $500,000 to the University of Wyoming’s Blockchain Research and Development Lab will go some way in helping to realize that potential -- and also help to bolster Wyoming’s burgeoning blockchain revolution at large,” says Charles Hoskinson, IOHK founder and CEO. “The Wyoming Blockchain Task Force’s supportive business environment is what led IOHK to choose to invest here.”

The IOHK gift is being doubled to $1 million by state matching funds and, as part of the legislative match, the university is providing additional supporting funds.

“The University of Wyoming is proud to be at the forefront of blockchain research and education, and we are grateful for this significant financial contribution from IOHK,” says UW Acting President Neil Theobald. “This support will help us continue to move forward in a very exciting and promising field of innovation and discovery.”

The gift will support the UWYO-IOHK Advanced Blockchain Research and Development Laboratory, which will be housed in UW’s Secure Systems Collaborative (www.uwyo.edu/s2c) along with CEDAR, UW’s Cybersecurity Education and Research center.

“The College of Engineering and Applied Science warmly embraces this new collaborative relationship with IOHK,” says the college’s interim dean, Cameron Wright. “This gift will enable students and faculty across multiple departments in the college to work together with IOHK to push the envelope on blockchain technology, including software, hardware and new blockchain applications.”

In this UW lab, faculty members and graduate students will develop practical hardware and software applications of blockchain technology in the real-world use cases of cryptography, authentication, supply chain management, cryptocurrency and smart contracts.

Blockchain is a breakthrough in database technology for storing information -- a secure digital ledger for smart contracts and cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and Ada, IOHK’s digital currency. This innovative technology is revolutionizing industries such as banking, law, identity and chain of custody.

The lab will take advantage of UW’s existing expertise in blockchain, including Professor James Caldwell and Assistant Professor Mike Borowczak, who will be co-directors of the Advanced Blockchain Research and Development Laboratory, as well as Philip Schlump. It will expand that expertise with visiting faculty and master’s, Ph.D. and postdoctoral students.

“This funding and partnership between IOHK and UW provide an unprecedented opportunity for the university and the state of Wyoming to establish ourselves on the leading edge of blockchain technology,” Caldwell says. “IOHK is building the blockchain of the future and has done so with a team of exceptional computer scientists from around the world. The UW Department of Computer Science is very pleased to have this opportunity to collaborate in building the future and to apply the technology right here in Wyoming.”

“This new endeavor enables UW to recruit and produce professional computer scientists, engineers, researchers and leaders with a unique set of core competencies related to the effective deployment of secure distributed systems,” Borowczak says. “From market analysis to fundamental secure hardware architecture and development to algorithmic and contract design to end-user implementations, our students, faculty and researchers will be positioned to define and solve the next generation of blockchain-related challenges as a result of this mutually beneficial partnership with IOHK.”

UW’s departments of Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering are working to establish the university as a leader in blockchain education, research and applications.

Based in Denver, Hoskinson has said he feels a moral obligation to Wyoming: His father is a physician in Gillette, and he would like to give back to the state. Hoskinson also was a guest speaker at the 2019 UW Hackathon. Founded in 2015 by Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood, IOHK is committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to provide financial services to the 3 billion people who don’t have them.

Wyoming blockchain legislation in 2018 and 2019 -- with more proposed in 2020 -- has established the state as a leader at the international forefront of this new technology, which promises to dramatically affect the lives of individual citizens, business practices, the day-to-day processes of government, and international trade and relations.

UW alumna Caitlin Long has been leading the charge in supporting Wyoming’s blockchain initiatives. Long is a 22-year Wall Street veteran who has been active in Bitcoin and blockchain since 2012. She was a member of the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force.

“It is wonderful for UW and IOHK to partner for blockchain research, as the IOHK team is highly academically focused,” Long says. “What an honor that they selected UW.”

The legislation puts Wyoming in the unique position of being a focus of the international community of blockchain technologists. As a direct result of the legislation, a number of blockchain companies have shown significant interest in locating in or relocating to Wyoming.

The gift announcement took place today (Friday) at UW’s Marian H. Rochelle Gateway Center. Speakers included Hoskinson, Theobald and Wright.","Coinbase’s merchant payments arm has added support for the dai stablecoin, bringing together online retail and decentralized finance (DeFi).

MakerDAO announced Thursday Coinbase Commerce had integrated dai as a payment method, opening the cryptocurrency up to affiliated online merchants and online commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce.

The integration will introduce “merchants to a growing segment of the cryptocurrency market, allowing them to bridge the gap between DeFi dapp entrepreneurs and their own “real world” businesses,” according to the blog post.

Coinbase Commerce is a free-to-use service for online retailers, allowing them to integrate cryptocurrency into their businesses. Starting out with bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC), the platform has only added support for USDC – the stablecoin created by Circle and Coinbase as part of the CENTRE consortium – since its February 2018 launch.

CoinDesk has approached Coinbase for comment and will update this article if we hear back.

With the new integration, merchants will also be able to earn interest on any received dai by transferring it into a Dai Savings Rate (DSR) smart contract on the maker protocol. The DSR interest rate was raised to 7.5 percent by community vote earlier in February.

MakerDAO says the integration will boost perceptions of dai and, potentially, bring increased adoption.

Currently, 435,000 ether (worth roughly US $117.4 million) have been locked up in dai “vaults,” down more than 75 percent since its all-time high in November, according to statistics site MKR Tools. Maker’s vaults create dai as users commit collateral assets into them.","An Indian cryptocurrency exchange has partnered with Malta-based trading platform OKEx to offer futures products specifically for the subcontinent market.

Mumbai-based CoinDCX announced Friday the strategic partnership will help it develop a new derivative facility – known as DCXfutures – in return for providing OKEx with a foothold in the Indian market.

Using CoinDCX’s new derivatives facility, Indian investors will be able to trade futures, with leverage of up to 15x provided by OKEx on nine cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and litecoin (LTC). Available to both institutional and retail investors, the platform will also offer perpetual futures contracts in both bitcoin and ether.

The partnership with CoinDCX – which is backed by an undisclosed amount from investors including Bain Capital – provides OKEx with insight, liquidity and connectivity to the rebounding Indian cryptocurrency scene, according to the announcement.

During the 2017 initial coin offering boom, five million Indians were estimated to be trading digital currencies, but in April 2018 the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s central bank, ordered financial institutions to stop dealing with any firms involved in crypto trading in 2018, greatly restricting the market.

Local exchange Koinex was forced to close its doors last summer, claiming the RBI ban had made it economically unfeasible for them to operate as a business. Zebpay, which used to be the largest exchange in India, complained the ban had “crippled” its ability to offer crypto trading services. Some, however, have soldiered on, offering crypto-to-crypto trading only.

In the coming weeks, the country’s Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the RBI acted outside its jurisdiction when it issued the banking ban. In anticipation of a favorable ruling, some cryptocurrency companies are beginning to set out their stalls. Binance entered the Indian market in November after acquiring local exchange WazirX.

“India is primed to be the driving force behind the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, which is why we are keen on adding more equitable currencies to the ecosystem,” said Zaz Zou, head of OKEx India. “We believe having a variety of options to transact digital currencies will bolster the growth of economy in India as it positively impacts both crowdfunding and institutional funding.”

Credit rating and audit firm Crebaco Global calculated the Indian cryptocurrency scene, if properly regulated, could have an immediate potential market size of $12.9 billion, with the possibility of creating anywhere between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs.

“We have witnessed rapidly growing demand for futures trading among Indian cryptocurrency market participants,” said CoinDCX CEO and co-founder Sumit Gupta. India could become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world just by leveraging the “huge potential of cryptocurrency markets to accelerate economic growth and wealth generation,” he added.","The developers of the Suterusu protocol are presently working on a scalable, privacy-preserving second layer solution for secure digital asset management. Any crypto-asset, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), may soon be used to conduct fully anonymous transactions using the Suterusu protocol. Suterusu’s technology, ZK-ConSNARK, allows users to perform very small and constant-size digital currency transactions and highly efﬁcient veriﬁcation. This solution is being developed by company chief technical officer Dr. Lin-Suterusu, who holds a Ph.D. in applied cryptography and privacy-preserving distributed systems. Zhengpeng Hou, CEO at Suterusu, stated: “Today, everybody calls bitcoin and other altcoins crypto coins, but the majority don’t have the attribute of privacy at all.” We recently caught up with Dr. Huang Lin who talked to us about the importance of financial privacy when conducting transactions using cryptocurrencies. Crowdfund Insider: Why is financial privacy so important in the digital age?

Dr. Lin: “Most people think that cryptocurrencies are anonymous and maintain the users’ financial privacy by default. The reality is the opposite. When Bitcoin (BTC) initially launched, the intention was to have a decentralized ledger that is, practically, about transparency. Every account or transaction can be found or accessed by anyone. And that information can be linked to the user’s identity. I believe nobody wants this in the conventional finance world. Our account information is protected by the bank, transplantation is also the same. Unfortunately, cryptocurrencies today lack this privacy or at least the majority is missing this. Therefore, we believe privacy, and in particular financial privacy, are critical in the digital age.”

Most people think that #cryptocurrencies are anonymous and maintain the users' financial privacy by default. The reality is the opposite Click to Tweet

Crowdfund Insider: Are there any regulatory guidelines that your organization or developers will be following, after implementing the Suterusu protocol?

Dr. Lin: “Suterusu is registered in Singapore, so any business activities, including our day-to-day operations and ongoing development efforts abide by the laws of Singapore. Our goal is to advance the technology and make it more user-friendly. We hope that more people can access privacy-preserving solutions through our endeavor.” Crowdfund Insider: Please explain how the ZK-ConSNARK protocol works and why we should use it. Dr. Lin: “ZK-conSNARK is a setup-free, zero-knowledge proof scheme with almost constant proof size and efficient proof generation and verification. Our yellow paper has provided a scheme based on class groups of unknown order. Here is the link: https://github.com/suterusu-team/Suter_yellowpaper. In the case of a fully decentralized cryptocurrency, all the nodes in the blockchain network are supposed to verify the transaction and the zero-knowledge proof is included in the transaction. The smaller the size of zero-knowledge proof, the larger the transactions-per-second (TPS) or throughput is. We also intend to keep both the proof generation and verification efficient in order to reduce the computation overhead for both the user and miners in the system. Currently, there are two types of zero-knowledge proofs in terms of its setup model, trusted setup and trustless setup, or setup-free. The zero-knowledge proof scheme used in Zcash requires a trusted setup, which implies you could print an infinite amount of zcash without the possibility of being detected. Our ZK-conSnark is setup free and hence does not have this kind of security risk. In short, zk-conSNARK attains the perfect balance between security and efficiency.”

Crowdfund Insider: Do you think leading privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) do a good job of ensuring financial privacy?

Dr. Lin: “They have done incredible work to bring privacy into finance, particularly in the crypto world, their work extends the crypto algorithm’s use case scenario. Because of their work, we have a certain level of privacy when performing cryptocurrency-based transactons, like stealth addresses and confidential payments. And now, people have more choices when trying to maintain financial privacy.”

Crowdfund Insider: What are some short- and long-term goals for this project and how do you plan to achieve them?","Bitcoin and Doomsday Preppers — Would Crypto Have Any Survival Value If SHTF?

As so-called “doomsday prepping” grows in popularity thanks to news of coronavirus lockdown in Chinese cities, red flag gun laws and rampant Fed stimulus in the U.S., preparedness enthusiasts are asking about the viability of bitcoin in a SHTF situation. From cautious, light investor, to vehement denigrator of the “NSA-created surveillance money,” there is no shortage of opinion. Still, as there are various possible scenarios, a one-size-fits-all proclamation doesn’t seem to work. Turns out, when it comes to money, what has survival value is ultimately a community affair.

Prepping: A Sensible Practice in the Current Climate

Preppers often get a bad rap in pop culture, laughed off as tinfoil hat-wearing, conspiracy theory-addicted alarmists. But to anyone who is paying attention to world events or has read a history book, there’s nothing ridiculous about being prepared for a worst case scenario when it comes to disaster and the collapse or throttling of vital societal infrastructure.

Recent videos surfacing from China appear to show police forcibly quarantining people who may or may not have the coronavirus. Venezuela’s Maduro is forcing residents of the country to transact with his petro shitcoin while people across the nation struggle just to eat. The U.S. Federal reserve continues to devalue the dollar while innocent people are extorted, jailed, and even killed for trying to preserve a little of their financial autonomy.

Should the state’s continued defecation-disguised-as-order finally and decidedly come into contact with the blades of reality, running to the hills or splintering off into micro communities could become a very real necessity for some.

Preparedness advocates have traditionally diversified into gold and precious metals, in case of hyperinflation or obsolescence of fiat currencies, but with the advent of bitcoin in 2009, the conversation began to evolve. Some preppers began to think bitcoin might also be a useful tool in the kit belt. Still, what good is an internet money without the internet, and isn’t the whole thing a creation of the U.S. government, anyway? It turns out there are multiple ways bitcoin could be leveraged, and these questions — as well as skeptical rebuttals — deserve careful examination.

Internet Money Without Internet

The first and most obvious reaction to suggestions of bitcoin as apocalypse survival money is the question of the internet and electricity. If bitcoin requires it, and doomsday destroys it or otherwise makes it unfeasible, it stands to ask how the hell bitcoin can be of any use to anyone in such a scenario.

""Hey guy who is prepping for when there is no electricity, phone or Internet service, you should like this thing that only works if there is electricity and internet!"" 🤦 https://t.co/zcaLaWJqVd — Ⓥin Ⓐrmani (@vinarmani) February 8, 2020

This is a valid and obvious point. No electricity means no bitcoin transactions and no mining. Although people have gotten creative and sent transactions which initially do not require internet, cellular data, or electricity other than batteries, ultimately the system depends on a power source and network connectivity to function long term. So when it comes to the complete lights out scenario collapsitarians are envisioning, crypto would indeed seem to be a largely useless appendage.

Many preppers maintain this is why gold is superior to bitcoin, pointing to situations like the one depicted in the video below, where a woman in China is said to be trading gold for rice with her upstairs neighbor in a locked-down apartment complex.

In situations where some network connectivity and power remain, however, the story might be different. Bitcoin is already touted as a means by which to avoid government devaluation of currencies and destruction of economies. Even in spotty circumstances the digital asset could at least theoretically survive, and retain this capacity to an extent, depending on the local community.

Mesh Networks and Localized Survival of Bitcoin

In a situation where an ISP fails, or some disaster cuts connection to the services most rely on to transmit bitcoin and crypto transactions, there are yet alternatives. Things like mesh networking and even amateur radio equipment can help bitcoin to remain viable in localized areas of infrastructure outage or collapse. Companies like Gotenna, for example, have developed technology which allows for portable antennas to push bitcoin transactions to nearby nodes even in the absence of cellular or internet service. Once the tx hits an internet-connected node on the mesh network, the transaction can be recorded.

In the case of political and economic meltdown, local fiat money may become better suited for toilet paper or kindling, while trade in bitcoin — presumably still valued and used by the outside world — could go on.

As engineer for Gotenna Richard Myers wrote in May last year:

Fortunately, alternatives to centralized ISP networks are starting to appear. Local mesh radio networks, satellites, and long-range radio have all been proposed as ways to enable decentralized peer-to-peer communication—both for Bitcoin transactions and for resilient communication generally.

At the end of the day, if a sociopath politician or act of god destroys, devalues, cripples or otherwise collapses infrastructure, networks with enough redundancy could enable bitcoin and trade in crypto to live on while plans for the next course of action are made. Still, even for things as conceptually straightforward as radio, a total martial law dystopia would make crypto’s survival doubtful, but at that point, humanity would have to preserve another currency, arguably much more precious: life itself.

Complete Blackout

To the credit of the skeptics, should the situation arrive when all the forced medical treatments, red flag gun laws, and rage and anger over the immoral drug war and endless military conflict finally boil over, bitcoin might be the last thing on people’s minds. When in the dark of your mountain bunker, trying to feed your family and keep them warm, checking Coinmarketcap probably won’t be a temptation.

However, before such a complete dystopia shows up, crypto is one way to peacefully fight for another storyline. One where free trade and economic sovereignty hold more and more sway as the capabilities of bitcoin are leveraged by people who are — contrary to the played-out statist propaganda — generally good and peace-seeking, and just want to be left alone to live their lives and pursue happiness to the fullest. Further, the sound economic model of bitcoin presents a means by which to preserve and leverage value better than fiat models and government systems allow, enabling one to better prepare for unexpected disasters right now.

As for the NSA creation theory, that is ultimately anyone’s guess. Regardless, by all rational estimations the tech works. And even if it were all some grand trick defying imagination, the outcome would still be much the same as the situation at present, anyway: man vs surveillance state.

As Long as There Is Society, Sound Money Will Have Value

Sound money has always had immense value in any society compared to lesser alternatives, and always makes a comeback, in the end. Even the cowry shells of the past, much better than other mediums of exchange at the time, stood to lose value to holders in episodes of prolonged disaster or tyrannic cruelty — simply due to the fact that mere survival can become the primary concern. When society is shattered, so is the very basis for any monetary system in the first place.

Gold similarly does little good if no one’s around to trade rice or other necessities for it. Bitcoin being subject to these same realities doesn’t mean it should be discounted as a useful tool for survivalists — just that it should be viewed soberly. As long as there is society, sound models of money will be in demand, and until you’re holed up in a cave all alone, miles from anyone on the blackened husk of an exploded world, bitcoin seems to be a valid consideration, even for those “nutty” preppers.

_________

Bitcoin takes over the digital world. From online retail to video gaming, from banking to travel — crypto adoption keeps gathering momentum in a variety of markets.

Some of the industries show great potential to expand after bitcoin adoption, but companies often don’t endorse the process due to a lack of favorable conditions. For example, bitcoin and retail seem to belong together, but the percentage of bitcoin payments doesn’t exceed a humble 2% for now.

Not only retail brands can benefit from utilizing bitcoin payments. Cryptocurrency has an edge over conventional currencies when users seek faster transactions and anonymity along with greater transparency at the same time.

A good example of an industry where users have such interests is online gambling. Players often complain that withdrawals take a lot of time, while some of them are frustrated by the necessity to verify their credit card details every time. Still, online casinos that accept bitcoin are a minority, representing roughly 5% of the online casinos available on the market.

Likewise, many countries in the world that could benefit from crypto don’t even try to take advantage of it. Instead, they perceive it as a threat to their operational banking systems and relate it to illegal activities like money laundering. Bitcoin is currently banned in China, Russia, Vietnam, and some of the Latin American states.

Today, however, we will focus on good rather than bad. Here is the list of top 9 countries that actively support bitcoin and work on the development of proper regulations for it.

1. Malta

Malta, often called the “Bitcoin Island”, doesn’t have any crypto regulations yet, but has a government-approved national strategy for bitcoin and blockchain promotion. Maltese officials see decentralization and other unique features of crypto as quite promising for the economy, as opposed to the countries mentioned above.

The largest crypto exchanges, Binance, OKEx, and ZB.com recently moved their headquarters to Malta. It happened because the legislative framework for such companies already exists along with the plan to establish organized registration for crypto service providers.

2. Switzerland

Switzerland is another destination for crypto-related companies to settle down. The renowned examples of those are Spaceshift and Xapo. The state was named “Crypto Valley” thanks to its progressive laws and attitudes towards bitcoin: now citizens can pay their utility bills with crypto and store bitcoins in crypto banks like SEBA Crypto AG and Sygnum AG, to which the government gave the green light in August 2019.

3. United States

The USA consists of 50 states, each has its own bitcoin policy, so the country can’t be called bitcoin-friendly as a whole. Bitcoin is legal and accepted across the land, with no states prohibiting it. According to the current legislation, bitcoin is taxed as property in all states. In reality, though, the situation is a bit more complex.

In these areas, bitcoin is used only by the minority. It doesn’t have

Despite some states like New York, Rhode Island, and Arizona defined as “hostile” towards crypto, there are comfortable areas for bitcoin trading and mining. Ohio, Wyoming, New Hampshire, and Washington, D.C are some of them. Especially it applies to Wyoming, which “races to fill the crypto-void in the USA”, as mentioned by some authors.

4. Australia

Australia is known for its open approach to technology trends. When the cryptocurrencies boomed in 2017, the country’s government promptly legalized them. Bitcoin regulations are well-defined: it is treated as property and subject to Capital Gains Tax. The state has many stores and restaurants that accept bitcoin as a payment method, the leading of which is Subway Australia.

5. Singapore

When it comes to technology, Singapore is blazing a trail. It has lightning-fast IT infrastructure and is the fourth leading country in the world for intellectual property rights protection. Being in constant pursuit of innovation, it is no wonder that the state quickly adopted blockchain.

Here, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are perceived as goods, so any owner has to pay a 7% tax while using it for purchases. Very soon, Singapore’s central bank is going to authorize crypto derivatives trading.

6. Slovenia

Did you know that little Slovenia offers more retail locations that accept bitcoin that the entire USA? And we’re not refuting the crypto loyalty of the United States, it's just that Slovenia holds an impressive record. Here, income from crypto trading is not subject to income tax. The officials are warmly welcoming crypto, smoothly integrating it into the Slovenian economy.

You can visit a shopping mall called BTC city in Slovenian capital Ljubljana. If you go to the town of Kranj, you will find there the world’s first public monument to bitcoin. Slovenia is the motherland for Eligma startup, which made crypto transactions substantially easier by launching its Elipay system. Now it counts 15,000 active users.

7. Estonia

Just imagine: Estonia implemented e-voting in 2005, years before it was done by anybody else. The country was even planning to introduce its own cryptocurrency, Estcoin, but EU agents harshly halted the initiative. Still, Estonia continues experimenting with blockchain technology and injects it into the healthcare and banking system.

8. Germany

Germany treats bitcoin as a legitimate, tax-free digital currency when it comes to private transactions. In 2020, German banks will be authorized to sell and store cryptocurrency. Sure, they’ll need to acquire a license for doing this, yet it’s a clear sign that Germany is moving in a bitcoin-positive direction.

9. Japan

Japan accounts for 10% of traffic coming to crypto exchanges worldwide. Not to mention that Bitcoin founder, Satoshi Nakamoto is claimed to be Japanese by nationality, although it’s a pseudonym. The country also became the birthplace of the world’s first crypto exchange — Mt. Gox.

The income tax is imposed only on individuals who earn more than 20M JPY annually or make a profit from bitcoin trading over 200K JPY. Those who don’t make substantial profits don’t have to pay any fees. Bitcoin is recognized as real money in Japan, so holding it is also a tax-free activity.

This list is not exhaustive, as many more countries are changing their attitudes for the better and demonstrate their loyalty to bitcoin. The brightest examples are Bermuda, Belarus, and Georgia. Despite their favorable conditions for bitcoin usage and trading, we listed only independent, high-income countries, which have well-defined financial regulations and an overall more stable banking system.","Developer Cindy Zimmerman and her mother, Judy Katzman, are among the cryptocurrency community’s most quietly prolific builders.

After learning about bitcoin (BTC) in 2011, Katzman worked for the early exchange BitInstant and Zimmerman moved to Panama in 2012 to work with Erik Voorhees and the other founders behind the crypto exchange Coinapult. Because Zimmerman earned part of her salary in crypto, up to 50 percent at the peak, she quickly realized the need for cash on-and-off ramps.

“There were a large amount of immigrants living in Panama that had to send money back to Venezuela,” Zimmerman said. “It’s hard to live off bitcoin. It’s doable, but it’s hard. Knowing where a bitcoin ATM is … is safer than meeting someone in a park.”

So she built one of the first ATM networks in Panama, five machines in total, which she operated until 2016 and freelanced for companies including the bitcoin ATM manufacturer Lamassu.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., her mom Katzman was also accepting a partial bitcoin salary and working with BitcoinStore, one of the first electronics stores to accept bitcoin.

The family experienced some pain points transacting across borders during Zimmerman’s time in Panama, but it taught them how to incorporate bitcoin into their daily lives. Then Zimmerman returned to New York in 2019, after years of freelancing for various crypto projects like Dash in Latin America, to launch her own crypto security startup called KeyFi.

“It’s a self-custody platform,” she said, describing KeyFi’s multisig setup. “They [clients] are going to be able to control and hold their own keys and pool together with other people.”

In addition to launching a startup, she’s also freelancing with her mom. Both women are blockchain consultants for the 25-year-old software development company AxisPoint, which is building a royalties management platform for music industry clients including Warner Music and EMI.

“This will give music artists accountability for their income,” Katzman said of the project, called RYTbox.

AxisPoint CEO Dan DiSano said the company already earns 10 percent of its income from blockchain projects, and expects offerings like RYTbox to account for 50 percent of its income by late 2020.

Earning is learning

These women opted to learn about bitcoin by working in the industry and managing parts of their household budgets with it.

Zimmerman said she hasn’t contributed to Bitcoin Core because working on a project with so much value, and scant corporate controls, carries a lot of pressure. That’s not to say she lacks ambition or trust in the network. She simply prefers to earn bitcoin while coding for traditional companies.

“You’re talking about large clients that have zero idea who I am, like Beyonce; even that, to some degree, is a lot of pressure because you’re dealing with a lot of money,” Zimmerman said. “The amount of pressure that goes into writing that code is already very, very high.”

Most freelance clients, like AxisPoint, prefer to pay her in fiat. But, perhaps counterintuitively, she said it’s easier to convince clients to pay her in various cryptocurrencies when the price rises and boosts industry optimism along with it.

While the younger Zimmerman is the token-curious cypherpunk in the family – using KeyFi to explore her obsession with the real user experiences related to self-custody – Katzman said she prefers to focus on enterprise use cases like AxisPoint’s clients. That makes Katzman an anomaly among technologists who lived through the dot-com crash.

She described blockchain technology as still at a “technical” level of development, with less widespread impact than earlier tech hype cycles. She believes once projects like KeyFi make security tradeoffs easier to manage, then the true boom will begin. As far as Katzman is concerned, the token boom of 2017 was only the beginning.","CoinDCX will be able to provide OKEx with valuable strategic insight, liquidity

Global cryptocurrency exchange OKEx has announced a partnership with Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange aggregator CoinDCX to launch a new crypto futures product in India.

Under the partnership, OKEx will gain unprecedented access to the Indian market and CoinDCX will have access to OKEx’s extensive experience in developing world-class futures products to bring more innovative service offerings to market.

The companies said that this strategic partnership is set to accelerate the mutual development of both CoinDCX and OKEx, allowing each to strengthen their global service offerings and expand their customer base.

CoinDCX will be able to provide OKEx with valuable strategic insight, liquidity, and connectivity within the Indian marketplace.

Zac Zou, Head of OKEx India, said: “As one of the largest economies in the world, India is primed to be the driving force behind the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, which is why we are keen on adding more equitable currencies to the ecosystem. We believe having a variety of options to transact digital currencies will bolster the growth of the economy in India as it positively impacts both crowdfunding and institutional funding.”

Beyond this partnership, CoinDCX also announced the launch of new DCXfutures product amid increased demands for access to futures, options and higher leverage trading for the Indian market. DCXfutures will allow for up to 15x leverage trading on a host of leading digital assets futures, including BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, EOS, ADA, and TRX. Users will also be able to trade perpetual future contracts with Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures.

DCXfutures is currently open for invitation-only access for select users. Once available to the general public, users will be able to access the newly-unveiled DCXfutures from a single wallet, which also supports the DCXlend, DCXmargin, DCXtrading, and DCXinsta products and wallet from Q2 2020.

CoinDCX CEO and cofounder Sumit Gupta said, “We have witnessed rapidly growing demand for futures trading among Indian cryptocurrency market participants. Our partnership with OKEx marks an exciting new chapter in our journey as we continue to strive to offer our customers innovative products and unparalleled market liquidity.”

Unlike other investment options such as stocks, mutual funds, among others, there are no government organisations which regulate cryptocurrencies around the world. Moreover, the Indian government has not yet given the status of legal tender to any cryptocurrency.

Since 2018, several crypto startups such as Koinex, Coinsecure, BTCXIndia, MoneyTrade, Bitconnect have shut down largely due to the regulatory challenges.

Just recently, the National e-Governance Division (NeGD), under the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), submitted a draft national strategy on blockchain for stakeholder comments. The draft suggested that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should release a Central Bank Digital INR (CBDR) administered over a public permissioned blockchain and supporting decentralised applications.

The RBI had also earlier shown interest in developing India’s national digital currency during deliberations over the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies.","This week in crypto, analysts predicted Bitcoin may go higher after breaching USD 10k. Justin Sun told people to buy his 'shitcoin,' and OKChain testnet went live; Voice Beta went live too, but not for all. Meanwhile, Ripple announced partnership with the National Bank of Egypt, Hadera is working with Google Cloud, BlockFi raised USD 30M and will open a Singapore office, Samsung is playing games with the Cryptoverse, and Huobi joined LG on the Klaytn council, while JPMorgan's Quorum may merge with ConsenSys. On the other hand, Poloniex rolled back 12 minutes of trading history after a bug detected in the system caused trades to be executed erroneously, Fcoin reported damages systems and lost data and is currently down, and there's no reprieve for LocalBitcoins traders whose BTC remains locked up. Also, while ETH grows on gaming dapps and Tron on Gambling dapps, EOS is going downhill.

Furthermore, the IRS said ""no taxes on gaming cash."" As the Cryptoverse cheered on US Federal Reserve Chairman's remarks, missing the warnings, cryptocurrency and blockchain industry officials were displeased with proposed leverage capping at Japanese exchanges. While Neogen Corporation partnered with Ripe Technology to track food and animal sources, Beijing launched a blockchain-powered loans platform to help keep small and medium-sized companies affected by the coronavirus afloat. FCA ordered the London Underground to take down advertisements for startup Zeux, and a Bithumb senior employee was found guilty of breaches of internet security law. And lastly, we looked into how Bitcoin-only narrative might help altcoins in 2020, and what crypto-related lawsuits can teach us.

And now – a spectacle!

The analytical agency Weiss Ratings is singing praises to Cardano again, saying that the platform is working on a ‘fresh new perspective’ for crypto

Cardano is currently ranked 11 on the CoinMarketCap’s scale. It seems to be favored by the Weiss Ratings agency that deals with financial analytics.

‘Fresh new perspective to crypto’

Several times in the past, Weiss Ratings has picked Cardano to call it superior to some other blockchains, e.g., EOS. A few times in 2019, the agency downgraded the tech score of EOS for lack of decentralization and predicted a great future to Cardano.

Now, Weiss Ratings is again tweeting praise about Cardano, saying that it is likely to bring a fresh new perspective to crypto.

The agency also expects Cardano to make a contribution to the DeFi sphere. However, innovations require a lot of research, which in its turn requires time, writes Weiss Ratings.

#Cardano has a way of bringing a fresh new perspective to crypto, and there's often a ton of research behind that perspective. We're looking forward to seeing what contribution it can make to #DeFi which, in our view, is the most exciting thing going on in crypto right now.$ADA — Weiss Crypto Ratings (@WeissCrypto) February 13, 2020

Will Cardano create a stablecoin?

Recently, U.Today reported that Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, spoke of a possibility of launching a stablecoin based on a DAI-pattern and powered by ADA. Weiss Ratings back then commented that the structure of DAI is more beneficial compared to USDC and Tether’s USDT.

Weiss Ratings jumps back to this topic in a recent tweet as well.",,,

The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence has admitted that cryptocurrency could undermine the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. The head of the U.S. Intelligence Community is seeking researchers to detail the impact of that status loss on the U.S., its economy, and national security.

Crypto Could Undermine USD as the World’s Reserve Currency

The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence has posted a research opportunity entitled “Evaluating the Impact of U.S. Dollar Losing Its Status as World Reserve Currency.”

“There are many advantages for U.S. national security to have the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency. Any international transaction settled in US dollars gives the U.S. jurisdiction over financial crimes associated with those transactions,” the office stated in its posting. “In addition, the U.S. is able to effectively level sanctions against or designate entities that violate international laws or treaties, or that have the potential to cause financial instability in global markets.”

However, “there are many threats to the U.S. dollar maintaining its status as the world reserve currency,” the Office of the Director of National Intelligence explained. “Countries such as China and India have large growing economies that could compete with U.S. economic growth,” its post describes, adding:

Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts predict that either a global cryptocurrency or a national digital currency could undermine the U.S. dollar … The U.S. should prepare for scenarios that threaten to undermine the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency and determine how those scenarios could be overcome, protecting our status in the global economy.

Referring to the above threats, the post notes that “If either of these scenarios or others come to pass, the U.S. would lose both its status in the world and its global authorities.” The posting further asserts: “The U.S. should prepare to identify potential ‘black swan’ events that could revolutionize the financial playing field in ways we do not yet understand – presenting strategic surprise — and understand root causes and driving factors that are particularly sensitive to certain global or technical events.”

Who Can Apply and Scope of Research

The research opportunity above is a U.S. Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program through the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Technology.

The Intelligence Community is a coalition of 17 agencies and organizations, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA). The Director of National Intelligence, acting as the head of the Intelligence Community, oversees and directs the implementation of the National Intelligence Program and acts as the principal advisor to the president, the National Security Council, and the Homeland Security Council.

Two positions are listed in the research opportunity posting: postdoc and research advisor. Postdoc applicants must be U.S. citizens and either recent Ph.D. graduates or doctoral students who will soon complete their degrees. Research advisor applicants must be an employee of an accredited U.S. university, college or U.S. government laboratory but are not required to be U.S. citizens. The application deadline is Feb. 28.

“This project should leverage all available information as well as recent breakthroughs in applied statistics, artificial intelligence, and deep learning to determine the most likely scenario(s) for how the U.S. dollar loses its status as the world reserve currency, why that scenario(s) is most likely, and in what timeframe this scenario(s) could unfold,” the Office of the Director of National Intelligence clarified, elaborating:

It should also detail the impact of that status loss on the U.S., its economy, and national security.

What sort of metrics can you use when you are trying to determine the health of a crypto project?

Perhaps one of the most intuitive yardsticks – particularly in a bear market – is developer activity.

So let us take a look at the major crypto projects that have shown the highest amount of developer activity in past 12 months – and examine just how important this metric really is for smart investors and what drawbacks it has.

Developer activity as a valuation metric

When you are attempting to evaluate the performance of a blockchain or cryptocurrency project, you can look at a number of metrics that help provide insight.

Developer activity is not your only ally on this front. There are also on-chain metrics, valuation ratios and market capitalization markers to bear in mind.

Developer activity really started to take off in popularity during the crypto winter, a time when falling or stagnating prices became an unreliable tool for measuring the growth of a project.

But what exactly is developer activity?

Well, put simply, developer activity refers to the amount of measurable coding effort undertaken by the people who work toward delivering a project or platform.

Most data aggregators that track developer activity typically monitor of the number of commits posted to GitHub.

GitHub is an open-source repository service where most developers host the code that provides a project’s architectural foundations.

The theory goes something like this: The greater the number of commits, the more developers (or development teams) are actively working on the project.

As such, developer activity is a strong indicator. It shows the project initiators’ level of dedication. And if there is an upsurge in developer activity, this could point to a possible upcoming announcement or a new release coming in the near future.

Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by Dev Activity

Taking a look at data compiled CryptoMiso, which describes itself as a web service that “ranks cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most popular Github repository,” can be revealing.

Here are the top 10 cryptocurrencies that have seen the most GitHub commits made in the past 12 months. (Market cap figures are from Coinpaprika data.)

Insolar (INS) (business-centered blockchain platform; market cap USD 6.7m) 8,519 commits; 37 contributors Aelf (ELF) (blockchain-powered cloud computing network; market cap USD 69m) 7,110 commits; 36 contributors Holo (HOT) (decentralized exchange; market cap USD 141m) 6,672 commits; 47 contributors Lisk (LSK) (open-source blockchain-based platform; market cap USD 239m) 6,271 commits; 62 contributors Nuls (NULS) (blockchain-based infrastructural support for businesses and developers; market cap USD 31m) 4,324 commits; 15 contributors. Chainlink (LINK) (platform that leverages oracles like Google and Oracle to verify data integrated into smart contracts; market cap USD 1,404m) 3,820 commits; 39 contributors Raiden Network (RDN) (off-chain scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain; market cap USD 8.8m): 3,763 commits; 74 contributors EOS (EOS) (smart contract platform; market cap USD 5,100m ) 3,378 commits; 100 contributors Zeusshield (ZSC) (decentralized insurance provider; market cap USD 0.56m) 2,957 commits; 7 contributors 0x (ZRX) (open-source protocol leveraging smart contract infrastructure; market cap USD 208m ) 3,312 commits; 68 contributors

What about the Big Boys?

It makes interesting reading to see that the biggest coins per market cap are largely conspicuously from this list by their absence. Only EOS (#7 in market cap) devs have been active enough to make the top 10.

Tron, which is knocking on the market cap top 10’s door at #12 has also made it to #11 on the commits charts – and is the only top 20 project besides Bitcoin to have over 100 contributors.

And what about Bitcoin, while we’re on the subject? Well, BTC is down at #17, with 1,810 commits.

Meanwhile, the data shows that Bitcoin’s nearest market cap rival, Ethereum, is way down on the commits ranking, with just 702 commits in the past 12 months – although those were made by over 100 different contributors.

The bottom line: can you trust dev activity as a metric?

Developer activity is certainly important in that it lets you gauge how active a project’s developer community is. It also lets you understand how many bug fixes and improvements are being performed on a cryptocurrency network before you start investing in it.

However, it is not the be-all-and-end-all of metrics. And for those who consider it a silver bullet for making crypto investment decisions, here are a few key drawbacks:

Activity does not reflect market interest or user demand

Dev activity stats alone do not provide insight into a project’s level of decentralization

Dev activity figures are relatively easy to game

A general rule of thumb with crypto investment-related decision is: Do not base your choices on any single indicator.

While it is interesting and can be valuable to learn about which projects are receiving the most commits and have the most active developers, it pays to look at the bigger picture.

But if you are torn between a few very similar projects, dev activity can provide important clues. More activity on a project often means more up-to-date innovations.

And in the fast-moving, ever-evolving crypto sphere, even the slightest of tech advances can mean a whole lot when it comes to predicting future performance.

The Post made stunning revelations in a report headlined, “How the CIA used Crypto AG encryption devices to spy on countries for decades.” Crypto AG was a Swiss encryption company. It made millions of dollars since World War II selling encryption devices. The governments of over 120 countries bought Crypto’s devices well into the 21st century.

Operation “Thesaurus”

But the Washington Post made the stunning revelation in early Feb 2020 that the information security company was secretly owned by the CIA. And the Central Intelligence Agency had built back doors into the encryption methods so it could easily decode messages and spy on foreign governments’ most sensitive communications. Governments the world over trusted Crypto AG to encrypt communications for their military, diplomats, and spies. Among Crypto AG’s clientele were Iran, military dictatorships in Latin America, India, Pakistan, and the Vatican.

Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?

From 1970 forward, most of the world’s governments were unwittingly handing the CIA their money and also their secrets. These revelations about this stunning and audacious CIA signals intelligence operation beg the question: Did the CIA create cryptocurrency? We still don’t know who invented Bitcoin. Its creator has remained anonymous to this day. The inventor of Bitcoin published the Bitcoin whitepaper under the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. And they posted to the Bitcoin Talk forum under that moniker. Could Satoshi Nakamoto be the Central Intelligence Agency?

Did The CIA Create Bitcoin?

There’s no conclusive evidence of who Satoshi Nakamoto really is. That remains a mystery to this day as far as the public is concerned. (Craig Wright’s objections to the contrary notwithstanding.) The following evidence that Satoshi Nakamoto might be the CIA is circumstantial, and the conclusion is speculative. But if it’s not compelling, this evidence is certainly captivating. And the Crypto AG revelations show just how plausible it is that the CIA could have created Bitcoin as part of the monetary coup of the century.

Evidence That Satoshi Is The CIA

To begin with, Bitcoin is based on technology created by the National Security Agency (NSA). The NSA’s Secure Hashing Algorithm 256 (SHA-256) is a lynchpin of Bitcoin Core, the software that turns a computer into a Bitcoin node. SHA-256 is a one-way hashing function that compresses and encrypts a string of any length into a unique 256-bit signature or hash. The original string cannot be determined from the hash. And it’s impossible to guess what SHA-256’s output will be for any given input. So it’s functionally random. You can enter Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address into it and get one hash, then change a single letter and enter it again and get an entirely different hash.

ADVERTISEMENT

None of this proves the CIA created Bitcoin. The NSA published SHA-256 in 2001. So non-CIA coders could have taken it up and used it to make Bitcoin. But after Crypto AG, it does make one wonder if there’s some kind of back door into SHA-256. Perhaps more incriminating is the meaning of the name Satoshi Nakamoto in Japanese. Nakamoto actually means “Central” or “Middle.” Satoshi means “Enlightened,” “Wise,” or “Intelligent.” These are facts. Satoshi Nakamoto means Central Intelligence. That could be a joke by its non-CIA creators, or it could be the CIA’s calling card.","Africa’s cryptocurrency industry has continued to grow as more people wake up to the massive opportunity that Bitcoin offers. This rise has been catalyzed by several factors including inefficient legacy financial systems and robust mobile money infrastructure. However, it has also been made possible with the efforts of some crypto companies that have endeavored to drive adoption in Africa. Luno is one of the key players, making it easy, convenient and affordable to buy, store and trade cryptos.

The African region has the fastest growing economy, with Ethiopia, Ghana, Senegal and Rwanda leading this charge. However, the region’s financial systems have failed to keep up. This has led many to turn to cryptos as they seek a more equitable system that caters to their needs.

Marius Reitz, the general manager for Africa at Luno, explained: “Africans are demanding a better and more fair financial system because the current system does not serve them too well. In many countries, traditional ways of exchanging value are very expensive and can be highly inefficient. As a result, doing business can be unnecessarily difficult and out of reach for many.”

He continued, “Africans using traditional currencies are often faced with high transaction costs, inflation and currency devaluation, exorbitant interest rates and high levels of fraud. Coupled with all this, accessing the existing system (despite the fact that many have a mobile phone and conduct other elements of their lives online) is still incredibly restrictive.”

In an interview with CoinGeek.com, Reitz pointed to this need for more efficient systems as the key reason crypto use has shot through the roof in Africa. This spike has been evidenced by the rise in number of crypto users, with Luno being one of the beneficiaries of this rise. The company surpassed 3 million wallets in 2019, processing $5 million per day in trades.

And while it’s the countries with the least advanced financial systems that would be expected to be leading the charge, the narrative has been a little different, Reitz told us. Countries like South Africa, which has Africa’s most efficient financial system; Kenya, a global icon of mobile banking; and Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, have led the crypto revolution. People in these countries have taken advantage of the more advanced banking infrastructure to access cryptocurrencies.

For Luno, it hasn’t been just about the profits. The company has endeavored to educate Africans about crypto, liberating them from the shackles of financial marginalization. The company’s aim is to enlighten more people about the opportunities offered by cryptos. In Africa, this is especially crucial as there’s a perception problem with cryptos, Reitz tells us. As CoinGeek has reported in the past, a lot of crypto scams have targeted the continent, taking advantage of the insufficient knowledge of cryptos.

Reitz remarked, “We hold regular meetups that provide a platform for existing cryptocurrency traders, buyers and prospective users to learn and share ideas around the evolving trends in the market. We also host university tours where we aim to build understanding about cryptocurrencies among students. As early pioneers in this industry, we feel it’s our duty to share our knowledge and excitement with the world as best we can. It’s about ensuring this happens across the board for consumers, the media and broader stakeholders.”

For the growth of the industry, Reitz believes that crypto companies must work with the regulators, and not against. “We believe regulation will bring greater clarity, protection and trust which will help cryptocurrencies transition to mainstream use,” he concluded.

For those of us who have been around since before the great crypto boom of 2017, having to undergo KYC (know your customer) procedures at digital asset exchanges was somewhat of an anomaly. “Back in the day” you were able to register to most crypto trading platforms using an email address and that was it. Those days are long gone.

Today, KYC is mandatory at effectively every reputable exchange and the number of no-KYC exchanges is dwindling fast. This begs the question: “Will no KYC exchanges survive in a regulated crypto market?”

The rise of KYC in crypto

While the majority of digital asset exchanges are not regulated in the same way as securities exchanges, most reputable crypto trading platforms have taken steps to prepare themselves for a future where the two worlds will merge.

A prime exchange for this would be New York-based Gemini, which was among the first trading platforms in the world to become a fully-regulated exchange. Gemini, founded by the Winklevoss twins, has always put regulatory compliance first and continues to do so today with recent hires of compliance offers and the launch of its own insurance company to insure user funds.

As 2017 took off and the ICO (initial coin offering) bubble was in full swing, financial regulators took notice and action in an attempt to protect consumers against losses in the cryptoasset markets. First and foremost, that meant that exchanges were scrutinized more closely.

Leading international exchanges that were once known for their easy and KYC-less signup process followed in Gemini’s footsteps and introduced identity verification measures. While in many cases small traders who only deposited and withdrew a few hundred dollars a month were left untouched, active traders and whales were asked to identify themselves via standard online KYC procedures that traditional online brokerages use.

Today, trading larger volumes on the exchanges which crypto market data provider CryptoCompare lists as the most trusted, including itBit, Gemini, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, Liquid, Bitfinex, OKEx, bitFlyer, OKCoin, Binance and others, requires identity verification.

Meanwhile, Poloniex recently announced that it will not require traders to undergo any sort of KYC, provided they stay under a USD 10,000 daily withdrawal limit. This decision came shortly after the exchange changed hands from Circle to a group of Asian investors, including Tron hypeman Justin Sun. Large traders, who deposit and withdraw higher amounts than that, however, will still have to undergo identity verification procedures.

A regulated market

If you have been following crypto for a while, you will know that regulation has been one of the biggest topics in the last couple of years. The G20 has been discussing and (supposedly) working on developing a global crypto regulatory framework, while several nations have taken actions to either encourage or curtail crypto activities within its borders.

However fast or slow lawmakers will act to create crypto regulations, we know that they are coming. The crypto markets have grown too big during the 2017 boom to be ignored. While digital currencies may not (yet) pose a threat to the established financial system, as a European Central Bank official stated, the crypto markets are now recognized as a viable alternative asset class for investors.

The main aim of financial regulators is to protect consumers of financial services. As such, regulating cryptoassets is high on their agendas. The high amount of scams and exchange hacks, as well as pump and dump coins that have plagued the market, has left millions of crypto investors with heavy losses. As a result, regulators want to take action to prevent future investors from losing money to these types of scams. The potential for money laundering and terrorist financing is another issue that financial regulators and lawmakers want to keep an eye on.

It is, therefore, hard to envision a future with less as opposed to more KYC in crypto.

Sam Blackmore, CEO of Bitcoin investment platform Vimba, agrees with this notion. He told Cryptonews.com:

“The reality is that exchanges need to take a pragmatic approach to enable Bitcoin to fulfill its adoption potential. Therefore, I can’t see exchanges that do not put KYC processes into place to survive in the near future.”

How will DEXs fit into a regulated crypto market?

When it comes to trading anonymously, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the go-to option today. Most DEXs operate on-chain using smart contracts and don’t even require an email address to trade. Therefore, trading on a DEX is effectively anonymous. Moreover, as decentralized exchanges are - at least in theory - protocols that operate independently of their owners, it is difficult to regulate them.

But how long will decentralized exchanges be allowed to operate in this manner?

Financial sovereignty, personal freedom and liberty are cornerstones of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As such, it would not be surprising if cypherpunk-oriented developers and entrepreneurs would continue to make it possible to buy and sell digital currency anonymously. However, the options to do so are becoming more and more limited as a result of crypto having gone mainstream as an investment asset class.

For exchange operators who want to build profitable businesses, however, KYC will very likely become mandatory across the globe.","The bull run is on, so its time to buy the dips.

The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo system provides excellent support levels for buying on pullbacks at and great discounts.

Bitcoin (BTC)

Image: Bitcoin (BTC) chart

The above chart is Bitcoin’s 4-hour Ichimoku chart. I’ve placed black horizontal lines that identify the daily chart Ichimoku levels. I’ve also included the Fibonacci retracement of the prior swing high of $10,522.51 on February 13th, 2020, to the confirmation higher low made on January 3rd, 2020. The likely hood of particular support levels in the Ichimoku system holding is increased when you compare multiple times frames. The probability of support being substantial is further increased if there is a corresponding Fibonacci level. The initial support level is the 4-hour Senkou Span B near the $9,777 value area. However, the deepest support zone with both a Fibonacci retracement level and an Ichimoku level would be between $8,350 and $8,500. The 50% Fibonacci level is at the $8,500 value area and the daily Senkou Span A is at the $8,350 level.

First Support Level: $9,777

Second Support Level (strongest): $8,350 - $8,500

Ethereum (ETH) chart

Image: Ethereum (ETH)

So Ethereum is off like gang-busters. From December 16th, 2019, low of $116.25, it has risen 149.46% to a 7-month high of $290. We’re definitely in the extremely high probability land of ‘pullback imminent.’ Ethereum’s 4-hour Ichimoku chart above is pretty damn healthy. There are clear and consistent drives higher with support found against key Ichimoku levels. The daily chart is straight-up parabolic. We could see a reasonably fast drop on Ethereum’s chart – but the distance could be muted compared to Bitcoin’s. There is a relatively large cluster of support zones within the $250 value area. As we look below the $250 value area, the next support cluster is between the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $216.02 and the Daily Kijun-Sen (which is also the Weekly Senkou Span B) at $222.05.

First Support Level: $251 - $257

Second Support Level (strongest): $215 - $223

Zcash (ZEC)

Image: Zcash (ZEC) chart

Zcash’s (ZEC) 4-hour chart (above) is displaying a classic short setup: Price and the Chikou Span below the Cloud. I’ve drawn two Fibonacci retracements, both to two different confirmations swing lows but with the same starting swing high. The most recent Fibonacci retracement creates a confluence zone of Fibonacci and Ichimoku levels. The 50% Fibonacci retracement of the most recent swing sits at $60.59 while the Daily Kijun-Sen sits just a hair above at $61.02. We should expect some support to be found here. But there is a massive amount of confluence zones below the $60 value area – four of them. Those four levels are:

1. Daily Senkou Span A ($51.35)

2. Weekly Tenken-Sen ($50.85)

3. Weekly Kijun-Sen (50.33)

4. 50% Fibonacci retracement ($50.21)

The entire range between the lowest and highest level doesn’t even crack $1.00. Given that there is such a massive cluster of Fibonacci and Ichimoku levels against such a powerful psychological level as $50, I would bank on a pullback to be $50 to be a very, very likely scenario.

First Support Level: $61

Second Support Level (strongest): $50 - $51

2020-02-17,"News 3 Reasons Why Crypto Markets Have Crashed Today

Last week, we were firmly back in bullish terrain with jubilant voices standing by bold predictions. Bitcoin and altcoins were all up with Ethereum leading the charge. This Monday, however, we’re back to a red crypto market.

What Caused the Crypto Market Crash?

As Bitcoinist reported earlier today, the weekend was savage for cryptocurrency. The total crypto market cap dumped more than $15 billion in 24 hours, falling well below the $300 billion level we were so excited about last week.

Taking a closer look at the events over the past 48 hours, these would seem to be the 3 most likely reasons for the crypto market crash.

1. Binance Performance Issues

On Friday, Bitcoinist reported that a “lagging” issue caused widespread REKage of traders.

Binance assured traders that the issue was fixed. But that was of no compensation to those who lost thousands due to a glitch that wouldn’t allow them to exit their positions.

And despite being “fixed” in record time, the problem carried on well into the weekend. Binance exchange continued to suffer from ‘performance issues’.

Trades were executed without being placed, prices weren’t being displayed correctly, altcoins dumped when BTC went down… it all sounds rather chaotic. In response to these issues, CZ stated that a report was being produced on the matter and thanked his customers for their support in the meantime.

Writing a detailed report on some of the perf issues we face in the last few days. Will publish in 24h or so. It's not the first time @Binance faced challenges, and it won't be the last time we solve them. We are humbled to have the heaviest traffic in crypto, and your support!🙏 — CZ Binance 🔶🔶🔶 (@cz_binance) February 16, 2020

Of course, that was met with a mixture of replies, as the Binance CEO predicted. Everything from “sh**show” to gratitude (and a whole lot more in between).

One rational trader commented that losing funds and orders “popping in/out of existence” was somewhat more serious than a “performance issue.”

@cz_binance @binance I love Binance and appreciate very much you looking into this, but to call this a ""performance issue"" is a bit disingenuous. I've had limit orders popping in/out of existence, orders passing but not showing up in either funds or order history & missing funds. — 0xMetatron (@0xMetatron) February 16, 2020

And having the “heaviest traffic in crypto”, these kinds of problems can lead to a cease of trading and widespread chaos across the board–a crypto market crash even.

2. ‘Fulcrum Trading’ Exploit Could’ve Aided a Crypto Crash

Over the weekend, TradingView’s top crypto trader, Jacob Canfield, reported that someone had exploited ‘Fulcrum trading’ and made off with $360K ETH.

Looks like there was a flash crash caused by an exploit from Fulcrum trading. Most likely a buy the dip opportunity once they remove the sell walls. Watching $BNB, $ETH, $XTZ and #Bitcoin of course. — Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) February 15, 2020

An opportune hacker was able to make the ETH almost instantaneously in one flash single loan transaction.

Canfield seemed to believe it was most likely a manipulative act to “buy the dip”. But it could have contributed to the wider crypto market crash.

3. Whale Manipulation on Saturday

On the topic of manipulation, there were also signs of substantial whale movements over the last 6 days. On February 11, BTC rose 5.39% in a matter of minutes. For the next 4 days, the leading asset whipsawed and broke down briefly to the $10,100 level before correcting back to $10,400. Then, at 15:00 GMT on February 15, BTC suddenly dumped 5% in a single trade. This pattern, dubbed the ‘Bart Simpson pattern‘, is frequently regarded as an institutional manipulation pattern which is employed to shake out weak traders.

Of course, there are macro factors on top of these that may have contributed to this latest crypto market crash. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s warning of “significant” new cryptocurrency regulations last week is hardly bullish. Frankly, it sounds more than a little ominous.

Adding to the anti-crypto sentiment in the U.S., was the Department of Justice calling bitcoin mixing “a crime”. The Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari also gave his 2-cents labeling cryptocurrencies “a giant garbage dumpster.”

Unfavorable regulation on the horizon is never a good sign. Although, the markets failed to react at the time of the news.

So, this time around, it looks more likely that it was an accumulation of inside jobs. If bitcoin fails to hold the $9,700 support level, we could see a tumble all the way back to the $8K region. Happy Monday!

Binance is set to develop white-label crypto exchange infrastructure for use by smaller exchanges, allowing them to focus on regulatory compliance.

Binance Cloud Service Extends to Exchange Infrastructure

Binance’s cloud service was already hinted at by the exchange’s CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, during an “ask me anything” session on Feb. 8. Their white-label exchange infrastructure will provide spot market and futures trading, bank API integrations, and fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchange services.

Exchanges will be able to rebrand the software infrastructure, to be hosted on Binance Cloud, to suit the needs of their local markets. A statement from the company explained:

“The Binance Cloud service is an all-in-one solution, featuring an easy-to-use dashboard that allows customers to manage funds, trading pairs and coin listings, as well as multilingual support, depth-sharing with the Binance.com global exchange, and more opportunities to collaborate with the ecosystem.”

White-Label Exchanges Nothing New

White-label crypto exchange infrastructure is not new to the industry. The current market leader is AlphaPoint, which claims to provide infrastructure to “over 100 exchange operators.”

Binance’s entry into the white-label market appears to be in line with the giant’s determination to redefine money and expand cryptocurrency access and services to a worldwide audience.

With Binance-powered matching engines, security, and liquidity solutions, new exchanges would be able to access instant workability and scalability. Startup exchanges have historically faced daunting setup costs, with many failing to gain significant market traction.

The 32nd largest exchange by 24-hour volume, according to CoinMarketCap, had less than half a million dollars in trading activity for the day at press time.","Chinese cryptocurrency exchange FCoin may not be able to pay back around 7,000 to 13,000 BTC (around $67 million to $125 million) to its users as the platform went default.

In a tell-all blog post titled ""FCoin Truth,"" the exchange founder and the former Huobi CTO Jian Zhang said the default was triggered neither by external hack nor scam, but a ""data error"" and a ""decision error.""

""The biggest problem that FCoin currently faces is not the problem that the system cannot be restored, but the problem that the capital reserve cannot be paid by users. The internal problems and technical difficulties we face are the results of financial difficulties,"" Zhang wrote in the post.

The founder said he will continue to handle withdrawal requests via email and expect the process to continue for 2 to 3 months. Meanwhile, he is planning to start a new project and pledged to use profits from the project and his personal funds to cover FCoin users' losses.

""I will be responsible for this till the end of my life,"" said Zhang.

Launched in May 2018, FCoin was able to quickly accumulate eyebrow-raising volumes through a new business model named ""trans-fee mining.""

Under the scheme, FCoin issued FT tokens and distributed 51% of them publicly by reimbursing transaction fees. Users were incentivized to transact as frequently as possible since the platform reimbursed 100% in FT tokens of the transaction fees they paid. 80% of the exchange's daily revenue from transaction fees were then paid back to users.

At one point in June 2018, around a month after the exchange went live, CoinDesk reported that its daily trading volumes hit over $5.6 billion, overshadowing the Top 10 exchanges on CoinMarketCap at the time.

According to the blog post, in the first few months following the launch, Zhang personally gained around $150 million to $200 million, and on some days the revenue payouts could be as high as 6,000 BTC.

However, at that time, the platform was, in fact, unable to build out a solid technical platform that could sustain the hype, Zhang admitted in the blog post.

Towards mid-2018, FT token price took a huge dip, stirring increasing criticism from the user community. To quell users' anxiety, Zhang decided to use company funds plus all its personal gains to buy back FT tokens. However, since some users had been exploiting FCoin's weak backend system to receive more dividends, the buyback continued to drain the company's and the team's personal funds until the FCoin platform was shut down recently.

As a last restort, Zhang asked Huobi founder Lin Li for help, although the latter declined Zhang's request.

""I told him the real reason (but not as detailed as this article), and then we explored possible rescue solutions. The results were exactly the same as I expected. Because I know that if Li Lin agreed to rescue, Huobi would not have today or tomorrow. If I were in his position that day, I should and would have made the same decision,"" Zhang wrote.

Last week, the exchange announced that it had destroyed all of the unissued FT tokens and decided to burn all 720 million tokens held by the team. It also began the email withdrawal process on Thursday last week.","The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has formally proposed a legal framework for tokenization, but also plans to label cryptocurrency transactions as suspicious activity, it said in a press release Monday.

The CBR announced it had successfully piloted a platform that allows users to tokenize assets, including equities and currencies, and issue them to investors.

Ivan Zimin, director of the CBR’s financial technology department, said in the release the bank had now proposed using the platform as a framework in the country’s upcoming cryptocurrency law, which will act as guidance for legitimate businesses wanting to tokenize assets.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

“Based on the results of the piloting, the Bank of Russia proposed to include in the draft federal law ‘On Digital Financial Assets’ the provisions necessary for the introduction and development of such decisions in the emerging digital assets market, which were supported by government bodies and businesses,” Zimin said.

This coincides with local media reports that the CBR is planning on updating bank guidance on what constitutes criminal activity, for the first time in eight years. According to business news site RBC, both the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies could be considered suspicious under the new guidance.

Still undergoing in-house assessment, the guidance would ask commercial banks to flag activity and authorizes them to block transactions, and even close the accounts, of any clients found to be trading cryptocurrencies.

CBR’s move has been met with some pushback from industry figures. Don Guo, CEO of technology and liquidity provider Broctagon, has criticized the fragmented approach. Speaking to CoinDesk, he said the two decisions on Monday will only create more uncertainty in the digital asset space.

“Russia seems to have taken one step forward, two steps back when it comes to crypto,” Guo said, adding it would leave “Russian traders scratching their heads” as other major economies, such as the U.S and China, continue to offer conflicting advice on how to regulate cryptocurrencies.

“Where China has been advocating for bitcoin (BTC) and creating its own digital currency, other countries like the U.S. seem to be fighting a losing battle to squash it,” Guo said. “Whether regulators like it or not, the adoption of digital currencies will continue, and dismissing cryptocurrencies comes with an opportunity cost.”

Since 2017, the Russian government has been drawing up a bill that would regulate cryptocurrencies and related activities such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) and trades with fiat currencies like the ruble. Although officials have previously indicated the bill was nearing completion, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao hinted in a speech last October that Russian officials were being indecisive.

The Russian parliament passed a digital rights bill in early October that outlined basic “digital rights” in Russian law and also provided legal definitions for smart contracts and cryptocurrencies.

Monday’s news suggests Russia is now trying to create a regulatory distinction between asset tokenization, which can more seamlessly be integrated into existing financial law, and cryptocurrencies, which cannot be as easily supervised and managed by the authorities.

In October, the CBR backed a potential ban on cryptocurrency payments, claiming they carried significant risks and could not be equated with legal tender.","News teaser Ripple to Become the Amazon of Crypto By 2025: Brad Garlinghouse

Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple took to the airwaves and spoke with CNN’s Julia Chatterly about the current state of Ripple, XRP, and the company’s plans for 2020. Garlinghouse concluded that in 5 years, Ripple wants to become the Amazon of the crypto industry.

Ripple grew during bear market, other blockchain projects had layoffs

Brad Garlinghouse was interviewed by CNN’s Julia Chatterly, this morning, and spoke about the state of Ripple, and its future plans. The Ripple CEO sees Ripple and XRP as doing very good currently, although he doesn’t pay much attention to short term price action.

INTERVIEW PART I 👇🏼

""Once regulators understand you're not circumventing regulatory frameworks they get very comfortable very quickly,"" @Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse explains why he's on a mission to educate regulators around the world. pic.twitter.com/2PMVvj3PZU — Julia Chatterley (@jchatterleyCNN) February 17, 2020

Garlinghouse views his company from a much longer-term standpoint. He compared the nascent crypto-markets with a couple hundred billion dollar valuation to markets like gold which are many trillions, comparatively.

Garlinghouse believes Ripple’s ecosystem will continue to grow and solve real problems for real customers with projects like Coil, for micropayments. Garlinghouse stated that he did not see Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other crypto projects as competing, and that overall growth in the space is good for everyone.

Ripple grew and added 150 employees during the bear market, while many other projects had massive layoffs. Garlinghouse also touched on Ripple’s upcoming IPO, although he didn’t give a definitive timeline.

We’ve added more than 150 employees last year, at a time when I think others have been less focused on solving real world problems. There’s been a bunch of lay offs in crypto community over the past weeks

Ripple also plans to work with regulators for more clarity. He wishes to see US become a leader in the crypto and blockchain industries but that won’t happen without regulatory clarity.

He said XRP’s value is north of $10 billion, so a $10 billion valuation for a Ripple IPO presents an opportunity for Ripple shareholders. An IPO would allow Ripple more flexibility to pursue deals like their $50 million investment in Moneygram, or Mexican exchange Bitso.

He also voiced the opinion that China’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is overall healthy for crypto. He believes that governments and central banks should consider crypto and blockchain tech.

When I step back and think about it macro, I think it’s really healthy and constructive for the entire crypto blockchain community to see central banks and central governments lean into what can these new technologies do to make our economy more efficient, our payment infrastructure more efficient… so at large I think it’s really positive.

Brad Dreams of Amazon-Status

Garlinghouse mentioned Amazon’s epic growth, and how it started out as an online book seller, before it made a pivot and began to dominate e-commerce. He envisions a similar potential for Ripple, although he does say that first and foremeost Ripple is solving cross-border payments.

I hope that in 5 years we’re not just Amazon books, we’re Amazon

He says it’s difficult to envision just where the crypto market will be in five years but he sees Ripple growing much larger and providing real solutions for customers. Ripple has been partnering with many strategic companies, like SBI, Moneygram, IndusInd, and Saudi Arabian British bank, to increase its marketshare and influence in the remittances and cross-border payments industry.

Garlinghouse says that since Ripple is open-source he is open to the idea of CBDCs launching on its blockchain. CDBCs could leverage Ripple’s technology for hyper-efficient cross-border payments across different banking jurisdictions. It will be interesting to see if any central banks take him up on the offer.

CBDC’s were a hot topic of conversation at Davos, this year, and many central banks in emerging economies are already researching the viability of launching their oiwn CBDCs.

Images via Shutterstock, Twitter @JchatterlyCNN","Craig Wright just claimed that Bitcoin is his property and he’ll take back control of it in 2020.

The founder of Bitcoin SV (BSV) and self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to own “full rights to the Bitcoin registry” in a blog post on Feb. 13. Very few people outside of Bitcoin SV supporters believe he created the first cryptocurrency.

Calling himself “the sole creator of Bitcoin,” Wright said “[t]his year, I am taking charge and control of my system.”

He even promised to pay taxes on “his” assets, noting that he is moving his “trust and related companies” to Britain from the offshore tax havens in which they currently reside.

“We have actively selected the UK, knowing that we will be paying tax in the country I have decided to live in, and are in the process of reporting assets we own in the structure to the British government,” Wright added.

Can Wright shut down bitcoin?

Wright also put the current developers of Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Roger Ver’s Bitcoin Cash (BCH) “on notice.” And while he didn’t say exactly for what, he did claim he right to either collect a licensing fee or even shut down the two leading Bitcoin chains.

“If you negotiate with me, arrangements can be made allowing the continuance of selected copies of my network, with a set of restrictions,” said Wright in his blog post. “In other words, I am willing to license the Bitcoin database.”

How Wright would go about disallowing the continuance of the distributed networks on which BTC and BCH live is very far from clear. They are, after all, designed to make that virtually impossible.

Instead of working with him, he complained, the leaders of those protocols have “sought to attack my character and impugned me.”

Approximately 62% of the value of all cryptocurrency resides in Bitcoin Core, which is valued at $187 billion at the time of publication, according to Messari. Bitcoin Cash’s market cap adds another $9 billion.

Wright has frequently claimed that his Bitcoin Satoshi Version fork—worth about $6.6 billion—is the only “real” one still faithful to Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision.

Wright is embroiled in a lawsuit brought by the brother of his late partner, Dave Kleiman. Ira Kleiman is seeking half of the 1.1 million bitcoins mined by the pseudonymous Nakamoto at the beginning of the blockchain project, as well as half of the Bitcoin intellectual property.

The latter part is what Wright just claimed to own. He also noted that because the Bitcoin software was released on an open source MIT License, other cryptocurrency blockchains like Ethereum and Litecoin are legal. Only forks still using the original Bitcoin genesis block are affected, Wright said.

Torts and taxes

As a matter of law, how would Craig Wright shut down Bitcoin? The legal reasoning behind these claims are spelled out in his 6,000-word post, but it boils down to Wright’s claim that Bitcoin is a database, and databases are protected by British and EU law. He also said that all 21 million bitcoins have, technically, been “issued.” Mining bitcoins does not create them, he argued. It merely distributes them as a reward for protecting the system from double spending.

“It has been a while since Bitcoin was copied and BTC first attempted to pass off as the original system, in a breach of copyright associated with the database created by agents funded under my unilateral contract from 2009 until the SegWit fork,” Wright said. “I apologize for the tardiness, yet if people had not been criminally breaching certain Acts, it would all not be necessary now.”

He concluded: “2020 is looking to be a fine year.”

Unless Ira Kleiman wins half the IP rights to Bitcoin, in which case Wright may well need his agreement to do anything.

Again, this all assumes the Wright really did create Bitcoin, which is almost universally disbelieved.

Of course, if he declares it as an asset under British law, we’re pretty certain the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be happy to believe him and present a tax bill.","Bitcoin Visa Head of Crypto Sees Bright Future for Bitcoin

Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto at credit card giant Visa, envisions Bitcoin Sats as the internet native unit of account for purchases less than one cent. He sees this as the main use case where the leading asset can supersede fiat.

Sats, an internet native micropayment standard

15/ Bitcoin uniquely has a native unit of account called a ""sat"" that currently represents 1/100 of a cent while BTC is $10k. The brand of ""sats"" is far from mainstream, but it could already be the most recognizable global unit of account to represent value < 1 cent — Cuy Sheffield (@cuysheffield) February 16, 2020

Cuy Sheffield has been thinking about Bitcoin and crypto a lot. Spurred on by a recent Tweet by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, Mr. Sheffield went on a tweet storm where he made a positive argument about Bitcoin’s capacity for micro payments using the Lightning Network.

As Sheffield points out, there is nothing you can buy online for less than a penny, using dollars. Sheffield makes an interesting case for users wishing to spend Bitcoin, even with its volatility and exponential growth. That use case is micropayments that can’t be made with dollars

If streaming money becomes the way content creators are paid in the next 5-10 years, we may see internet users who don’t know or care about Bitcoin still using Satoshis to pay for online content. Things like streaming a video, reading online articles or listening to music could cost a small number of satoshis.

18/ If new use cases like paying sats to remove ads, tip influencers, join private messaging groups, or buy digital goods emerge, sat denominated payments over Lightning or a similar open source layer 2 network have a significant leg up to be used in them over USD. — Cuy Sheffield (@cuysheffield) February 16, 2020

Sheffield believes that since payment amounts could be as little as 100th of a cent, users won’t FOMO buy or spend because the amounts are so small. Even with high volatility, they could still make micropayments and not see much of a difference in purchasing power.

Micro wallets denominated in dollars, using bitcoin behind the scenes

These wallets could still be denominated in dollars with Sats being a sub penny fractional unit of account for micro-purchases. The open source nature of Bitcoin development provides a revolutionary opportunity for new apps in this particular space.

These apps could outcompete the US Dollar because the American Government would need to create a whole new sub cent unit of account, which would have to be globally adopted by developers.

He believes that since the amounts in question are so minimal, the mental transaction costs of making such minimal purchases would not cause a drastic change in online behavior, like it might if denominated in cents.

10/ Whether you realize it or not, every time you actively make a purchase, your brain has to calculate a mental transaction cost. You decide if the item or service is worth the amount you are paying for it and if you really want to buy it — Cuy Sheffield (@cuysheffield) February 16, 2020

While the Lightning Network is in its early stage of development, it is still the most viable second layer Bitcoin scaling solution currently available in the crypto market. There is still quite a learning curve and obvious limitations to the technology, but a consumer facing application which makes it easy to use for non-tech types could be the catalyst to drive micropayments mainstream.

What do you think of Satoshis as the micropayment unit of account? Let us know in the comments!



Images via Shutterstock, Twitter @CuySheffield","Lawmakers in Brazil have garnered support to create and enforce tax regulations for the cryptocurrency industry following reports of rampant fraud in the sector last year. Now, the effects of those regulations are being felt: according to Bitcoin.com, two of the country’s cryptocurrency exchanges–Acesso and Latoex–have made the decision to shut down in the face of hefty fines, stricter rules, and dwindling trading volumes.

Acesso Bitcoin, one of the crypto exchanges that will shut down, points to the current situation created by the new regulations as the main reason for its shutdown.

The new regulations made have impacted crypto trading volumes

“After the Federal Revenue Service introduced these rules we noticed a significant decrease in the traded volume,” said Pedro Nunes, the exchange’s co-founder, according to Portal do Bitcoin. “We also feel that the market has cooled off for smaller exchanges,” he added. (Translated quote.)

The new regulations, which were implemented in the latter half of 2019, require crypto holders to report all transactions involving cryptocurrencies. The rules apply to individuals, as well as companies and brokerages. The regulation also includes all crypto-related activities–in addition to buying and selling, hodlers must report donations, barters, deposits, withdrawals, and other activities.

Those who fail to adequately report their crypto transactions are subject to penalties ranging from 500 Brazil reals (BRD) to 1500 BRD, or from $120 to $360. Beyond the fines, however, compliance with the new regulations also requires investments into new resources–a cost that some exchanges can’t seem to swing.

Latoex also cites pressure from the new regulation

Latoex (Latin America Token Exchange, formerly known as E-Juno) us the second Brazilian crypto exchange to have recently made the decision to permanently close its doors.

Suggested articles Top 6 Crypto Trading Tools You Should Use in 2021Go to article >>

Latoex has also cited the new tax laws as the primary reason for its demise. The shutdown was confirmed last week by Deigo Velasques, the chief executive of the exchange’s investment arm, Latoex Capital. Latoex Capital, which split off from the exchange in December, may stay operational after the exchange ceases its operations.

In the meantime, however, Latoex’s exchange is selling its assets to other companies and returning its funds to its clients. The exchange is also reportedly attempting to reverse a suspension order issued by Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission, or else face a $23,000 fine if Latoex does not follow through with its decision.

Brazil still lacks comprehensive crypto regulations

While the country is lacking more general cryptocurrency industry regulations, there are multiple proposals for cryptocurrency regulations currently making their way through Brazil’s national congress.

Bill 2303/2015, the most comprehensive of these bills, was introduced to the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies nearly five years ago before being archived in 2018 and later placed back on the agenda in March 2019. Two other bills, PL 3825/2019 and PL 3949/2019, are currently being reviewed by the Senate.

The shutdowns in Brazil are somewhat similar to several decisions by several European cryptocurrency companies that have made the decision to either cease operations or move abroad after the implementation of the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD.)"
2020-02-18,"Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg proposed creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in a new financial regulation plan.

Bloomberg’s campaign published a financial reform plan Tuesday, advocating for greater consumer protection measures and a stronger financial system. Specifically, the proposal suggests requiring financial institutions to monitor risk exposure, recording all financial transactions in a centralized database, strengthening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a number of other recommendations. The proposal also recommends creating a regulatory sandbox for startups and “providing a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.”

“Cryptocurrencies have become an asset class worth hundreds of billions of dollars, yet regulatory oversight remains fragmented and undeveloped. For all the promise of the blockchain, bitcoin and initial coin offerings, there’s also plenty of hype, fraud and criminal activity,” the full proposal said.

Bloomberg’s plan recommends clarifying which agencies are responsible for overseeing the space, creating a framework to clarify when tokens are securities, “protecting consumers from cryptocurrency-related fraud,” clarifying the tax regime and defining the requirements for financial institutions in the space.

The campaign did not return a request for further comment.

Bloomberg became the latest of a small group of presidential contenders to address cryptocurrency during his campaign, following Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) and Andrew Yang, both of whom have since dropped out of the race.

Swalwell accepted cryptocurrency donations briefly during his run, while Yang also called for a national regulatory framework to address questions around how the government would approach the space and supersede potentially contradictory state-level regulations.

Road to November

Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and founder of Bloomberg L.P. (the company behind the Bloomberg Terminal), entered the presidential race in November 2019, and has missed the first primary and caucus (New Hampshire and Iowa, respectively) due to joining late in the primary process (in comparison, former contender Andrew Yang entered the race in November 2017).

Despite his late entry, Bloomberg has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into ad campaigns. As of press time, he is polling at roughly 16 percent, according to news site 538, enough to place second on the national stage.

However, his candidacy has recently been rocked by allegations of racism and sexism, including from his support of New York’s infamous “stop and frisk” practice during his time running the city.

The practice was later deemed unconstitutional, and while Bloomberg appealed the ruling, his successor, former presidential candidate and current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped the case.","Blocknox, a subsidiary of second-largest German stock exchange Boerse Stuttgart, is expanding its cryptocurrency custody service to institutional players.

According to an announcement from the bourse on Tuesday, Blocknox already provides custody for crypto assets on an “escrow basis” and has made the service available to users of Boerse Stuttgart’s BISON app and its digital assets exchange, BSDEX.

The firm is now aiming to expand its services outside the group’s own offerings, planning to safeguard cryptocurrencies and “other digital assets” for institutional clients such as banks and asset managers.

“As a pioneer in Germany, Blocknox has already been operating as a custodian of cryptocurrencies for more than one year,” said Dr. Ulli Spankowski, managing director of Blocknox and chief digital officer for the boerse. “Now we want institutional clients to benefit from our experience and set-up as well. They can use Blocknox’s reliable custody as a building block for their own services around digital assets.”

The firm said it has already built and deployed a “multilevel security concept” to protect assets under custody.

With new rules for Germany-based cryptocurrency services introduced in early January, Blocknox said it has already informed regulators of its intent to apply for a license, which means it can offer custody services on a provisional basis. The firm plans to submit the final application before the set deadline to become a regulated financial services provider.","Regulatory Roundup: Trump's Cryptocurrency Proposals, IRS Changes Rule, China Quarantines Cash

In this roundup, we cover numerous cryptocurrency regulatory developments in the U.S., including President Trump’s crypto proposals, testimonies by the Federal Reserve chairman and the Treasury secretary, a crypto-friendly SEC proposal, and the IRS changing a crypto tax rule. We also cover China quarantining yuan bills, its central bank filing 84 digital currency patents, 40 German banks wanting to offer crypto services, several blockchain initiatives by the Indian government and more.

Trump’s Budget, Fed Chair’s Testimony, SEC Proposal

It has been a busy week for the U.S. government trying to regulate the crypto space. Perceiving cryptocurrency as a threat, President Donald Trump proposed a few measures to increase oversight of the industry in his new budget. He wants to return the Secret Service to the Treasury “to create new efficiencies in the investigation” of crimes, including those involving cryptocurrencies. He also proposed a budget of $127 million for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) “to combat emerging virtual currency and cybercrime threats.”

Also last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testified before the Senate Finance Committee. After answering questions about a digital dollar, Powell said “The idea of having a ledger where you know everybody’s payments is not something that would be, you know, particularly attractive in the United States context. It’s not a problem for China.” Mnuchin revealed that the Treasury will soon release new crypto regulations to increase transparency. Independently, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, called bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “a giant garbage dumpster.”

While the Department of Justice (DOJ) is criminalizing onchain privacy starting with mixers, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence is seeking researchers to determine how cryptocurrency could undermine the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. The director is the head of the Intelligence Community comprising 17 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Security Agency (NSA). In addition, the U.S. is auctioning over 4,040 seized bitcoins, currently worth approximately $40 million.

In the financial sector, token projects may see a sign of relief from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce has unveiled her “Token Safe Harbor Proposal.” It is designed to give token projects a three-year grace period before deciding whether they involve the offering of a security. Meanwhile, the pro-crypto presidential candidate Andrew Yang has dropped out of the race to become the president of the United States.

IRS Backtracks on In-Game Tokens

Soon after the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) started accepting tax filings this year, it modified the text of a page on its website which details the tax treatment of cryptocurrency. The agency announced on Feb. 14: “The IRS recognizes that the language on our page potentially caused concern for some taxpayers. We have changed the language in order to lessen any confusion.”

The topic of confusion is in-game currencies. Previously, the IRS listed “bitcoin, ether, Roblox, and v-bucks” as examples of a convertible virtual currency. However, it quietly removed everything except bitcoin last week. The tax authority clarified:

Transacting in virtual currencies as part of a game that do not leave the game environment (virtual currencies that are not convertible) would not require a taxpayer to indicate this on their tax return.

China Quarantines Banknotes

China is currently combating the coronavirus which has killed more than 1,500 people and infected more than 66,000 people in the country. The government is now scrubbing and quarantining banknotes to stop the spread of the deadly virus by touching the bills. The central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), explained that banks use ultraviolet light or high temperatures to disinfect yuan bills. They are then sealed and stored for seven to 14 days, depending on the severity of the outbreak in a particular area, before being recirculated.

As for the impending launch of a central bank digital currency, the PBOC has reportedly filed 84 patents relating to its digital yuan. “Virtually all of these patent applications relate to integrating a system of digital currency into the existing banking infrastructure,” patent attorney Marc Kaufman commented.

German Banks Declare Intent to Offer Crypto services

More than 40 financial institutions in Germany have reportedly declared to the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) that they are interested in offering cryptocurrency custody services under the new German law. The law implementing the amendment to the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive entered into force on Jan. 1.

The regulator told news.Bitcoin.com that financial services companies as of that date must submit their intent to apply for a license by March 31 and complete a license application by Nov. 30. The length of time it takes for an applicant to be granted a license depends on the individual case.

Furthermore, German banks are still struggling to cope with the negative interest rate policy maintained by the European Central Bank (ECB). At least 41 banks in the country are now charging their customers negative interest rates and the number is rising.

Australia Has 312 Registered Crypto Exchanges

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the country’s financial intelligence agency and anti-money laundering regulator, has confirmed to news.Bitcoin.com that it has registered and enrolled 312 digital currency exchange providers.

“Since April 2018, AUSTRAC has regulated digital currency exchange providers to minimize the risk of criminals using them for money laundering, terrorism financing and cybercrime,” a spokesperson for the regulator said.

Indian Government Dives Deep Into Blockchain While All Await Supreme Court Verdict on RBI Ban

The government of India has been ramping up its efforts to integrate blockchain technology into its existing infrastructures. Last week, the country’s Chief Election Commissioner revealed that the Election Commission is working on a blockchain system for voting.

Earlier this month, the government’s premier policy think tank, Niti Aayog, released a report identifying key blockchain use cases in India. It followed a report entitled National Strategy on Blockchain, compiled by the National Institute for Smart Government as directed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). It calls for the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), to issue a digital rupee. Moreover, the Telangana state government has launched a blockchain accelerator in partnership with Tech Mahindra and IBC Media.

While the Indian government has not made a decision on whether to regulate or ban cryptocurrencies in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently awarded a young entrepreneur for her work on a cryptocurrency app. Additionally, the supreme court has yet to announce its verdict on whether to lift the banking restriction imposed on crypto businesses by the RBI. The court wrapped up hearing the arguments against the ban several weeks ago and has reserved judgment on the case.

Switzerland to Lower User-Verification Threshold

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has published a proposal for a follow-up crypto regulation. It proposed amending the client identification threshold values in its Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance from CHF 5,000 ($5,092) to CHF 1,000 for crypto exchange transactions. FINMA says it’s “acknowledging the heightened money-laundering risks in this area.” The regulator is holding a consultation on this follow-up regulation until April 9.

The law requires that the exchanges report to authorities every transaction or face high fines. This has seen a drastic decline in crypto trading volumes, forcing two exchanges to call it quits in the past week alone.

The two exchanges, Acesso Bitcoin and Latoex shut down in fear of punitive measures by the Federal Revenue Service. The two cited the new legislation as the reason for the exit, revealing that things started going downhill when it came into effect.

Known as the Normative Instructions 1888, the legislation requires, among other things, that crypto exchanges report every transaction they process. Those that fail to comply will be subject to severe penalties, including a $346 fine per month. It also requires them to adhere to more stringent compliance requirements.

The co-founder of Acesso Bitcoin Pedro Nunes told Brazilian crypto outlet Portal do Bitcoin, “After the Federal Revenue Service introduced these rules we noticed a significant decrease in the traded volume. We also feel that the market has cooled for smaller exchanges.”

Nunes urged users to withdraw or transfer their funds from the exchange, stating, “We recommend that anyone who has funds in Bitcoin to transfer to other exchanges. Those who have funds in BRL [Brazilian Real], can make withdrawals at any time, within the terms that were practiced while we were operating normally.”

Sao Paulo-based Latoex also shut down this week but is yet to reveal why. Its users are also able to withdraw their funds or transfer their tokens to other exchanges or wallets.

It’s been tough in Brazil for crypto exchanges for a while now, with the lack of proper regulations doing a great disservice to the industry. The country’s banking institutions have used this to deny basic banking services to the exchanges. As CoinGeek reported last month, some of Brazil’s largest banks have already started closing bank accounts belonging to crypto. One of these banks, Bradesco, cited high money laundering risks as one of the reasons it stopped supporting crypto.

Crypto exchanges have in the past sued these banks for denial of service, with most of them winning their lawsuits. Last year, Bradesco was forced to pay legal fees and fines after a court sided with M Intermediação e Prestação de Serviço crypto exchange in a legal battle between the two. Walltime exchange also won a similar case just days prior against Caixa Econômica Federal bank which had also closed its account.

A new recording dedicated to the developers behind a number of leading cryptocurrency projects just dropped on Monday. Penned by Joshua Mapperson, the head of content at Aelf Blockchain, and produced by David Verity, ‘Crypto Anthem’ features a long list of cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, including Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, Dash, Stellar, Chainlink, Tether, Monero, IOST, VeChain, Ontology and the song’s sponsor: Aelf.

The songwriters are hoping the EDM track can bring the bickering and deeply divided cryptocurrency community back from the edge of destruction.

In the wake of philosophical divisions, hard forks, DApp wars, Satoshi battles, adoption jockeying, and one team of developers shredding another over having better technology and faster transaction speeds, tribalism among the 2,000-plus projects remains an existential threat to the industry, as the quest for decentralization seems unable to prevent crypto kings and queens from slaying one another.

With competition biting deep, the anthem shines the light on blockchain brands that could leverage their unity in order to challenge the status quo instead of driving wedges that tarnish the industry.

In a tweet last year, Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder, a New York venture firm that specializes in cryptoassets, encapsulates how the movement is shooting itself in the foot.

“Tribalism is the biggest drain on crypto’s human resources that I see today. Tribal toxicity drives newcomers away, has caused valuable talent to leave the industry, and clouds the thinking of the committed.

To those that aren’t deep in crypto, we all look like part of the same movement. It makes no sense that a movement attack itself. We end up looking incoherent, nasty, and immature. Who wants to join such a movement?”

According to the team behind ‘Crypto Anthem’,

“There are constant issues surrounding crypto twitter and other crypto communities in relation to project rivalry, scams, false claims and accusations that can sometimes be quite toxic. This song hopes to drive past all these problems and focus on what really matters, crypto is here and here to stay. It doesn’t matter if your platform has more dapps on it, or your project creates a better social media following. What matters is that we are all pioneers in an emerging technology that will revolutionize the world.”

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Wit Olszewski","When Jack Dorsey founded Square in February 2009, Bitcoin was all of one month old. In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto and Dorsey were likely laying the groundwork for their respective creations concurrently in the year prior. Ten years later, the two would converge in what now seems like an inevitable collision.

Square launched its Venmo-like payment service, Cash App, in 2013. The application features common stock investing, and in June 2019, it added bitcoin to the mix of assets you can purchase on the app.

But a few months before this, in March 2019, Square established an additional business arm: Square Crypto. But don’t let the general “crypto” moniker fool you. This auxiliary venture’s purpose? To work on Bitcoin-specific development full time.

""Square is hiring 3–4 crypto engineers and 1 designer to work full-time on open source contributions to the bitcoin/crypto ecosystem. Work from anywhere, report directly to me, and we can even pay you in bitcoin,"" Dorsey tweeted at the time.

Its first hire was Steve Lee, a former Google project manager and a sometimes Bitcoin developer with a handful of commits to his name on GitHub.

This seminal hire would be followed by positions for prolific Core contributor Matt Corallo; Lightning Labs developer Valentine Wallace; Google software engineer Jeffrey Czyz; and Arik Sosman, a former architect behind Facebook’s Calibra wallet for the libra digital currency.

Each of Square Crypto’s hires have some experience developing Bitcoin and its adjacent technologies. Its Twitter account often tweets out maximalist takes with a bullish tinge. The only link in its Twitter bio is to the Bitcoin white paper. And its bio, instead of some boilerplate message lauding its parent company Square to the world, reads “Bitcoin for all.”

That bio sums it up. Or as Lee put it while speaking with Bitcoin Magazine,“What we aim to do is make bitcoin a widely-used global currency.”

The Square Commitment to Bitcoin: Open-Source Software and Noncustodial Solutions

With the exception of Corallo, Square Crypto’s recently-outfitted team came from legacy tech companies. And most of these poached employees were Bitcoin tenderfoots — they may have had a little bit of experience coding Bitcoin but not as much as a veteran like Corallo.

Learning the ins-and-outs of Bitcoin wasn’t an issue. What could have been, however, was a lack of cohesion among the team. Most open-source developers (and Bitcoiners here being no exception) are used to a fair degree of autonomy; Corallo, for example, had been the recipient of grants for undirected work on Bitcoin Core before.

But most of these hires were, as Lee put it, accustomed to working on focused projects while at their former FAANG employers.

“From the outset, we had to decide our model and approach and how we were going to organize the team,” Lee said. “[In] traditional companies you work as a team and focus on a project. In open source, that’s not common, per se. Each individual contributor is ever independent and usually anonymous. We decided that we wanted to work as a team.”

And what would they be working on? Lee emphasized that the team is “focused on open source and the broader ecosystem,” in particular noncustodial and key management solutions.

“We feel like custodial solutions will be naturally invested in [by financial investors], but there is a long-term risk for Bitcoin when the user experience gap between custodial and non-custodial user experience will widen due to under-investment in non-custodial [solutions], because there’s not a strong business model associated with that,” Lee explained.

Indeed, custodial options proliferate in the bitcoin market. According to figures estimated by Nic Carter based on Coin Metrics data, roughly 4.4 million bitcoin are held on exchanges (this data, Coin Metrics cautions, is not exhaustive and is a lower-bound estimate. The figure Carter gave Bitcoin Magazine includes bitcoin custodied by Coinbase, while the initial Coin Metrics data he drew from does not). This is nearly 25 percent of bitcoin’s outstanding supply and more has entered custody more quickly than bitcoin’s supply is inflated.

For the average user, storing on an exchange or a hedge fund-like custodian is simpler than storing their private keys themselves. Lee’s fear is that, if Bitcoin continues to catch fire, more bitcoin will fall into the hands of third-party guardians than today’s figures. As exchange hacks in the past have shown us, this makes Bitcoiners’ holdings kindling for potential disaster.

Lightning Development Kit

In order to ameliorate this perceived issue, Square Crypto’s team has chosen an area of the ecosystem that features perhaps the most custodial solutions available: the Lightning Network.

More abstruse and technically challenging than running Bitcoin Core, the Lightning Network requires a full node to run precisely as intended. Failing this, you can run a lightweight wallet with the Neutrino protocol or use a custodial wallet — typically, the latter option provides a less-frictioned user experience.

“Less-frictioned” because the Lightning Network, exciting as it is, is still nascent and clunky. Announced at the end of January 2020, Square Crypto’s Lightning Development Kit (LDK) is being designed to make it easier for developers to build on Lightning. In turn, this will hopefully improve the UX for Lightning’s growing user base.

For Square Crypto, it’s a chance to make a big impact in one of the smaller sectors of the Bitcoin development economy.

“It lets our relatively small team team have an outsized impact over most of the areas in Bitcoin that need to improve for it to be a widely used currency,” Lee said. “We chose the LDK because that’s the best way we can leverage our team. If we’re successful, the LDK will lower the barrier to entry for a developer building on Bitcoin.”

When asked if Square’s Cash App would integrate Lightning using the LDK, Lee emphasized that his team is “independent of Square.”

Of course, he would love to see Square adopt the solution when it’s released, “but at the same time,” he continued, “we’d love to see Coinbase use it and we’d love to see BitGo and Bitstamp and other companies to use it. Strategically, we want to increase the chances of Bitcoin’s success to accelerate that as much as possible. If we’re able to contribute to that, I think that Square as a corporation will be happy and feel like the investment will be a success.”

But whether or not this project wows Square’s corporate echelon isn’t phasing Square Crypto’s project plan. Dorsey gave the team a budget to solve problems for the Bitcoin ecosystem, so that’s what Lee is determined to do.

“What Jack has told us is we’re free to decide what we think is best for Bitcoin. Square's commercial interests don’t influence us,” he said. “The Bitcoin ecosystem is our boss (not Square) and the community is our customer.”

Where Corporate Meets Open Source

Lee makes it seem like Square Crypto is made up from the vestiges of Square’s corporatism, which dissolved and resolved itself into an independent body that more closely resembles the slap-happy, open-source groups of Bitcoin’s cypherpunk faithful than it does the exit-seeking technocrats that dominate Silicon Valley.

BTCPay Server, an open-source and decentralized bitcoin payment processor, comes to mind. In fact, the BTCPay team, which works entirely on a volunteer basis, received one of the first of Square Crypto's open-source grants. This $100,000 grant was succeeded by another grant for an undisclosed amount to anonymous Bitcoin developer ZmnSCPxj.

This is part of Square Crypto’s two-front strategy to march Bitcoin toward mass adoption: On one front, it will develop the LDK; on another, it will pass the buck to independent developers and projects to advance Bitcoin’s growth.

“For some developers this can be an awesome opportunity — to work on something that they’re very passionate about and not really have a boss,” Lee said. He stressed that these grants will be “hands off,” so teams should have a project plan in place and a clear direction forward if they want to receive funding.

Square Crypto has more grants in the works, though Lee wouldn’t disclose the forthcoming recipients. He did say that Square Crypto would hopefully give out a dozen grants per year.

He also clarified that these grants don’t need to be related to what Square Crypto’s core team is doing. In fact, the projects eligible for grants don’t even need to be highly technical. Though Square Crypto is looking for proposals related to privacy (ones that would, say, advance new technologies like Snicker or older ones like CoinJoin), they can also be for design work, project management or UX work.

Returning to Square Crypto’s focus on the “open-source and broader ecosystem,” Lee recognized that the road to making Bitcoin function smoothly on a mass scale will be long — but Square Crypto’s goal is to make bitcoin a widely used currency, so it will take this road in stride.

“It’s a marathon — not a sprint,” Lee concluded.","Cannabis Buzz Harshed by Regulations, Cash Shortage While Cryptocurrency Is Ready to Light Up

Recent reports show that major marijuana companies are running out of money, and businesses in Canada are especially in danger of becoming illiquid. Major producers in the weed-friendly nation have just over 6 months of cash on hand, according to the information, and comparable companies in the U.S. just over one year of liquidity. In the U.S. the falling cannabis stocks and sluggish market present an even greater threat, since companies cannot file bankruptcy as the plant is still illegal under federal law. All this seems to beg the question: where is crypto in these trying times?

Businesses Running Out of Weed Money, Black Market Still Thriving

The recent wave of cannabis legalization across the United States and Canada brought with it a surge in cannabis company stock prices and high hopes of big money and a thriving industry. Some also speculated legalization would curtail black market spending. The outcome however, has been a hard comedown for many in the sector, where only the biggest players able to pay for necessary compliance measures, overhead and other fees can compete and secure funding.

Many companies have not been able to keep up with demand or establish locations convenient to their customers due to laws and regulations. As BBC News Toronto’s Robin Levinson-King reported in December:

Red tape and a cap on the number of cannabis retail outlets have made rollout slow. Retail licenses were awarded by lottery, and the province held the number of licenses at 24, to serve a population of 14.5m.

A recent article from Bloomberg, citing a report on liquidity in the industry, claims the most endangered company is Canada’s Aurora Cannabis Inc., with only 2.3 months of cash remaining. A previous report from the same outlet shows cannabis stocks tumbling since a peak in spring 2019, resulting in a scramble by companies to take cover from incoming calls on their debts.

Meanwhile, the black market is able to provide enough product, locations, and customized service to result in the majority of Canadians still preferring to use illegal cannabis.

As of December, Statistics Canada maintains that about 75% of users still use illegal marijuana, according to Levinson-King’s report. This is no surprise, really, given the inefficient nature of government central planning, but even with these dreary numbers and regulatory challenges, it seems that major cannabis companies — as well as alternative markets — could benefit from greater integration of crypto solutions. With bankruptcy proceedings for some groups already underway, one wonders what these companies have to lose by trying to target the crypto segment.

The Canna-Market Has Spoken, Prefers Decentralized Solutions

Aside from the obvious utility of crypto for purchasing marijuana on darknet marketplaces, the bitcoin and cannabis spaces have great potential synergy even above ground, in legally compliant situations. As news.Bitcoin.com reported back in September, a Berkeley City council member purchased cannabis with bitcoin cash at a local dispensary, and key benefits of crypto were discussed at the demonstration.

Assets like BCH can provide vendors a way to save on transaction fees, when customers pay with these assets in lieu of credit cards and other e-payment systems. Cryptocurrencies also help with access to banking services not provided by many traditional banks, pressured by legal restrictions to avoid businesses in the cannabis industry. With mounting bankruptcy cases, lack of banking services, and remarkable inability to meet customer demand, it seems high time lawmakers and regulators fired up a bowl of their own, perhaps, and reconsidered.

Not only do the crypto and cannabis communities share a significant cultural overlap, but in Canada and the U.S. most consumers have already voted with their money to support alternative markets, as they provide better service. Decentralized money such as bitcoin — like decentralized cannabis dealers — provides convenience and customization of the purchase process. Should governments want to get in on this cash cow, acceptance of crypto and a relinquishing of neurotic central planning of the industry seems to be a must.

The differences between instant and traditional exchanges do not make one inherently better than the other — they’ve been created for different use cases. Developing an understanding of instant crypto exchanges will help you determine which solution best fits your needs. Below are some of the potential benefits of opting for an instant crypto exchange:

Funds storage — safety

Perhaps the most fundamental way, in which instant crypto exchanges differ from their more traditional exchange counterparts is the way funds are kept. Instant crypto exchanges receive and deposit funds directly to your wallet, meaning you retain custody — as opposed to custodial trading exchanges that hold your assets for you.

As you know, not your keys, not your coins. By enabling you to retain custody of your funds, instant crypto exchanges grant you more control and better safety. If you practice good operational security, which typically includes not holding your funds on an exchange, then the likelihood of an attacker wanting to gain access to your wallet is relatively small compared to the massive honeypots of custodial exchanges. In 2019, we saw 12 exchange hacks, with stolen funds totaling over $290M. By using an instant crypto exchange, you can avoid the centralized exchange hack risk without having to constantly be shifting your funds on and off an exchange.

It should be noted that instant exchanges utilize traditional custodial exchanges to execute an order. This means that for the duration of a transaction the specific funds involved in the trade are briefly custodied by the underlying exchange.

Signups and interface — ease of use

If you don’t already have a favorite exchange, the signup and registration process is a factor to consider in choosing one to use. Many of the traditional exchanges have lengthy signup processes that include identity verification and long processing times. In contrast, many instant crypto exchanges allow you to exchange crypto-to-crypto trading pairs with only an email, mobile app or wallet address. Changelly, for instance, requires you to use an email or social media page to sign up for your account — a process that takes minutes before allowing you to trade. Not surprisingly, if you’d like to trade fiat-to-crypto, Changelly does require you to go through a Know Your Customer process and to connect your bank account, though purchases under $150 can be made without KYC.

Once onboarded onto an exchange, you will also see a major difference between the user interface of the instant vs. the traditional. Instant crypto exchanges feel more like modern financial apps than trading terminals; they’re sleek, simple to use and highly intuitive.

While this might feel minimalistic to an experienced trader, for those looking to simply invest or make a single transaction, it’s a highly attractive option. To compare, power-traders using options like Coinbase Pro see the following:

Source: pro.coinbase.com

As it is clearly evident, a traditional crypto exchange has a lot more information for an experienced trader to digest and act on. But for users looking to have an easy on-boarding and trading experience, instant crypto exchanges offer a much simpler alternative.

Aggregation and fixed/floating rates — price

For those of you familiar with traditional crypto exchanges, you’ll know why Coinbase Pro’s interface is so extensive in comparison: You need to know what the price and depth of the order book in order to make your trade. This order book depth is exchange-specific — it only includes the orders placed on Coinbase. Instant crypto exchanges, on the other hand, aggregate prices and liquidity from multiple exchanges, meaning you get access to the best prices those multiple exchanges have to offer, with deeper liquidity and less risk of slippage.

When placing the actual order, these two solutions also differ. A common traditional exchange order type is a limit that tells the system to execute the buy or sell order when the price is at or better than a specific limit. This gives traders more flexibility and control over their trades.

Instant crypto exchanges also have a beneficial feature in trading execution: fixed or floating rates. A floating rate is executed at the best possible price at the time of the transaction, which could be slightly above or below the quoted price due to market volatility. A fixed rate locks in a specific rate and guarantees the trade will be executed at that price, which, again, might be above or below the floating rate depending on market volatility.",
2020-02-19,"Coinbase: First Crypto Company to Become an Official Visa Principal Member

U.S.-based cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase on February 19, 2020, announced that it had become the first pure-play cryptocurrency company to receive Visa membership.

Coinbase Becomes an Official Visa Member

In a recent announcement, San Francisco-based digital currency exchange Coinbase stated that it had become the first cryptocurrency firm in the world to be approved as a Visa principal member. Notably, the Visa membership will enable Coinbase to bring further improvements to its customer experience, subsequently making it easier for customers to spend digital currencies for routine purposes.

For the uninitiated, Coinbase’s fling with Visa began in April last year when the cryptocurrency exchange joined forces with fintech firm Paysafe to launch the Coinbase Visa debit card. Later in the year, in November, the cryptocurrency card added support for a slew of digital currencies including Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), Basic Attention Token (BAT), REP, and 0 protocol (ZRX).

Today, the Coinbase crypto card is available to customers in 29 countries across the world. Citizens of these countries can spend as many as ten cryptocurrencies in millions of merchant locations, the blog post reads.

Coinbase Crypto Card Successful in Europe

Since its launch, the Coinbase crypto card has witnessed a steady rise in popularity not only within the cryptocurrency ecosystem but also among the mainstream. The card’s utility is unparalleled in that it allows users to pay with cryptocurrencies for services ranging from funding foreign holidays to booking trips on public transport.

Per sources close to the matter, more than 50% of Coinbase crypto cardholders use the card regularly. The card is particularly popular in European countries including the U.K., Italy, Spain, and France. As reported by BTCManager in June 2019, Coinbase had announced that it will be expanding the market footprint of its then-novel cryptocurrency debit card by launching it in six European countries.

The blog post reads in part:

“Following the success of Coinbase Card, we are proud to be the first company in the crypto ecosystem to be granted Visa principal membership. This membership will enable us to offer more features for Coinbase Card customers; from additional services to support in more markets — all elements that will help to evolve and enrich the cryptocurrency payment experience.”","U.K-based crypto exchange Coinfloor, which made news last year by delisting ethereum to focus solely on bitcoin, is launching a simplified buying service.

Going live next month, Coinfloor, the longest-running crypto exchange in the U.K., is providing an “Auto Buy” service aimed at bitcoin (BTC) newbies and hodlers alike, as opposed to sophisticated trading types.

It’s all part of Coinfloor’s “no BS” approach to crypto, said CEO Obi Nwosu, who wants to educate new users as well as offer full transparency in the form of monthly proof-of-custody audits of all the coins held on the platform.

“There are maybe 5 percent of people who are either trading professionals or who like to speculate – for them high-volatility trading is fine. But we want to make the exchange for the other 95 percent who don’t want their currency to be volatile. Our idea is to try and make buying bitcoins boring,” said Nwosu.

Coinfloor’s Auto Buy uses dollar-cost averaging so that users who might be queasy about bitcoin volatility can buy small amounts on a regular basis over the long term. These purchases once set up are done via bank transfer using the U.K.’s Faster Payments system.

Nwosu said it comes down to advising people to start with amounts as little as £10 (US$13) per week “buying bitcoin regularly in the background at an amount that’s very comfortable for them.”

“If you are going to do it, you are going to want to do it with an asset that has the longest track record of growth and the highest likelihood of growth in the future, and that’s bitcoin,” said Nwosu.

Coinfloor is proud of its bitcoin audit service, which the exchange has been releasing every month for some six years now. It consists of a time-stamped and transparent list of all the balances being held for pseudonymous customers.

A number of large crypto exchanges agreed to provide crypto solvency audits following the notorious collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange, but none of them kept to it, Nwosu said.

Pointing to this week’s FCoin debacle, Nwosu asked why exchanges are not providing proof of custody.",These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, suspended trading on Wednesday for more than six hours for “system maintenance.”

The exchange, which has offices and corporate registrations in Malta, Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and elsewhere, resumed trading around 5:30 p.m. UTC (12:30 p.m. Eastern time), according to a notice on its website.

The exchange had alerted users earlier in the day that it suspended all deposits, withdrawals, spot trading, margin trading, person-to-person trading, lending, redemption and asset transfers from sub-accounts, margin accounts, futures accounts and wallets that hold government-issued or “fiat” currencies. Futures trading was unaffected, the exchange said.

During the Binance outage, rival cryptocurrency exchanges saw big jumps in trading orders, based on data from the website Coin360. According to the site, transaction volumes over the 24 hours through 12:36 p.m. ET jumped more than 50 percent on the Malta-based exchange OKEx and on London-based Bitstamp. Binance’s 24-hour volume dropped by 31 percent during the period.

Josh Goodbody, Binance’s London-based director for growth and international business, told CoinDesk in a series of WhatsApp messages that there was an “issue with an engine that pushed data around the system.”

“It was a simple systems messaging error that we wanted to fix straightaway,” Goodbody said. “Main effect was balances were slow to update.”

It’s “definitely untrue” that the exchange suffered an internal hack, he said, referring to some posts on social media.

Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted “all systems back to normal” at 12:57 p.m. New York time.

Hours earlier, Zhao tweeted that the exchange would “waive everyone’s margin interests for today.”","Michael Bloomberg has unveiled a stance on cryptocurrency policy, making the businessman and former mayor of New York the only active Democratic presidential candidate to directly address the topic.

He’s got a plan for that: As US president, Bloomberg would “work with regulators to provide clearer rules” for cryptocurrency users and businesses, according to a new campaign document describing his plans for financial industry reform. “Cryptocurrencies have become an asset class worth hundreds of billions of dollars, yet regulatory oversight remains fragmented and undeveloped,” the document states. It says that Bloomberg would seek clarity on hot-button issues including digital token sales, consumer protection, requirements for financial institutions that hold digital assets, and taxation of cryptocurrencies.

Vaguely regulated: For years, cryptocurrency enthusiasts and industry advocates have called for the federal government to answer a number of important questions. When is a token sale a security sale? What measures should cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial institutions be required to take to protect their customers’ digital money? And there is all sorts of confusion around the issue of taxation. Some have argued that when it refuses to clearly answer these questions though new regulations or laws, the government risks losing innovative companies to other markets.

“Healthy competition”: Bloomberg seems to agree that a lack of regulatory clarity is holding back innovation: “For all the promise of the blockchain, Bitcoin, and initial coin offerings, there’s also plenty of hype, fraud, and criminal activity.” The campaign says its focus on crypto is part of a larger emphasis on innovations that can provide “healthy competition” in the financial services industry.

Crypto, the campaign issue? Cryptocurrency still has relatively few users, but as Bloomberg notes, hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake. Besides that, Facebook and other technology companies are considering issuing their own digital currencies, raising questions that policymakers—and possibly the next US president—will need to answer about the future of money. Andrew Yang, who recently exited the race, had made a similar promise to seek clarity from regulators. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has spoken out only once about crypto since he’s been in office, tweeting in July that he is “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”

Victor received a Master’s Degree in Information and Communication Technology from the University of Wollongong in NSW.

The adoption of cryptocurrency continues to accelerate despite persistent market uncertainty. Since touching record highs in 2017, the market has seen both significant gains and losses, generating a continuous stream of competing forecasts. And while future price movements are anyone’s guess, one fact is inevitable - those using cryptocurrency need a wallet to hold it.

Whether or not you hold your own private keys or rely on smart contract functionality, a crypto wallet is integral to partaking in the realm of digital currency. Reflecting this reality, the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance found the number of crypto wallet users nearly doubled in 2018. Today, data suggests the number of blockchain wallet users is more than 40 million.

And as the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, this wallet usership is set to increase. However, market maturation comes with an evolving regulatory landscape - and the impacts are spreading around the globe. As central banks and their government overseers grapple with the emergence of digital currency, a new set of conditions will alter the trajectory of crypto wallet use.

Exploring Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)

Most notably, central banks around the world have begun to assess the viability of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Already comfortable with their role as sole financial overseer, it’s no surprise that these long-standing institutions are employing this approach to crypto implementation. But what exactly is a CBDC?

In short, it’s a virtual currency issued and controlled by a federal regulator. As such, CBDC’s are not decentralized like the majority of cryptocurrencies. Instead, they represent fiat (paper) currency in a digital form. As such, central banks issuing a CBDC act as the currency regulator and their client’s account holder simultaneously.

According to a recent survey from the Bank for International Settlements, 70% of respondents are currently (or will soon be) engaged in CBDC projects, representing a marginal increase since 2017. However, despite the apparent exploration of this crypto issuance model, many central banks remain on the offensive when it comes to CBDCs. In the same survey, over 85% of central banks responded that they are either somewhat unlikely or very unlikely to issue any CBDC in the near term.

But why is this the case? In many instances, governments can’t yet see the value of digitizing their national currency. For others, the regulatory and fiscal implications of introducing a CBDC are vast and complex - not every country is ready to face these challenges.

In the face of this reluctance, there are also significant implications for citizens. For governments, CBDC’s allow broader financial oversight and control. Because a CBDC can be implemented in the absence of blockchain technology, effectively acting as centralized digital cash, the encroachment on personal freedom is hard to ignore.

Stablecoin Momentum

Many believe that stablecoins, most notably Facebook’s Libra, forced central banks to recognize the rise of cryptocurrency and growing calls for instant, cheap digital payment solutions. Further validating this opinion Christin Lagard, president of the European Central Bank, expressed her support for the bank’s involvement in the development of a CBDC for this specific application.

So, what’s so enticing about stablecoins? In short, they represent a safer way to invest in the digital asset class, given their real asset backing. In aiming to eliminate the volatility of cryptocurrencies, stablecoin projects have become a significant portion of the crypto ecosystem. According to a report from Blockchain, stablecoins account for 2.7% of the total crypto-asset market, up from 1.5% in September 2018. The report further estimates the total value of stablecoins now exceeds $3 billion, more than doubling from $1.4 billion in 2018.

Emerging Crypto Wallet Trends

As the stablecoin ecosystem continues its dramatic expansion and governments further explore the potential of CBDCs, several crypto wallet trends have begun to emerge. And while the impact of each is uncertain today, each will have an undeniable influence moving forward.

The Future is Non-Custodial

Cryptocurrency exchanges have a long, well-documented history of security breaches. Because exchange platforms assume custody of cryptocurrency deposits, user private keys are made vulnerable - an arrangement often exploited by nefarious market players. In 2018 alone, a record total of $865 million was lost across six exchanges following hacks - more than double the amount lost in 2017.

According to the Chainalysis 2020 Crypto Crime Report, 2019 saw more cryptocurrency hacks than any other year. However, of the 11 that occurred, none were comparable to the value of past heists. Despite total losses dropping significantly to $283 million in 2019, these losses remain understandably startling to both investors and lawmakers.

As non-custodial storage solutions, crypto wallets and decentralized exchanges (DEX) bolster security. In short, users can choose to keep their private keys to themselves, retaining complete control over their crypto. And because the vast majority of stolen funds originate from exchanges, crypto users are certain to leverage the added security of these platforms moving forward.

Global Remittance Networks

According to figures from Blockdata, the global remittance market will generate $1.035 trillion by 2022, and $1.413 trillion by 2025. As mentioned, central banks face increasingly competitive blockchain-based remittance platforms. In the face of mounting pressure, it’s perceivable that reluctant governments will need to reassess CBDCs and their place within an existing financial system.

With a growing number of governments moving to support the growth of both stablecoins and CBDCs, crypto wallet usership is sure to accelerate. As regulations become more stringent, crypto wallets will come to serve as a crucial component of digital infrastructure.

The Reality of KYC and AML

According to the latest Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report from CipherTrace, 65% of the 120 most popular exchanges have weak or porous KYC practices. The results of this large-scale study are said to constitute the first-ever comprehensive data on KYC practices at cryptocurrency exchanges around the globe.

Source: Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2019 Q3

As one of the most prominent movements in the crypto ecosystem, robust KYC and AML practices represent a shift in industry sentiment. By conducting geographical-based verification, companies hope to validate real user identities, introducing another layer of security.

However, while novel in concept, enforcing these requirements will prove difficult using existing means. Because non-custodial wallets function similarly to software without a server, an internet-based app is not required, limiting potential oversight. Instead, KYC and AML oversight can be built into the digital assets themselves.

Recall that digital assets are smart asserts, and many already utilize this functionality to automate processes. Under this dynamic, if a trader fails to provide a KYC attestation, a smart contract would decline the transaction. In short, trying to regulate a non-custodial wallet is like asking a plastic bag manufacturer to ensure their product can’t be used for nefarious activities.

An Evolving Ecosystem

As governments around the globe grapple with their response to the rise of cryptocurrency, it’s apparent that non-custodial crypto wallets and DEX’s will play an increasingly crucial role in the ecosystem. These external platforms will introduce greater security, user autonomy, and industry legitimacy. Just as regulators concern themselves with the implications of digital currency introduction, current users must remain vigilant in protecting their privacy and crypto-assets online.

Without sustained effort, cryptocurrency wallet development will bring us to a future where wallets outperform the well-entrenched financial infrastructure we’ve come to know. Perhaps this day will come sooner than we think.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Since its anonymous formation in 2009, Bitcoin, as the first cryptocurrency to operate as a decentralized, digital exchange, has gained both a vast user base and an increased value. Despite hitting the expected lows of any value-based currency, bitcoin has had a fairly consistent rise financially and has resulted in the invention of cryptocurrency-based technology such as blockchain, as well as the expanse of the digital market. It looks as though this trend will continue through five-year bitcoin adoption predictions made by digital currency financial market experts across the board, as well as potentially impacting the overall development of the worldwide currency market.

Why Bitcoin?

The continued use of bitcoin appeals to a wide market of individuals for a variety of reasons. As a currency operating independently of a central bank, no one country or financial entity is able to control the trading, whether you are buying or selling your Bitcoin. This also makes the value difficult to artificially inflate, as no single power can be responsible for its creation. Due to the way bitcoin is organized, it also represents an incognito way to make digital transactions throughout the world, in a range of digital markets, using a series of statistical and computer-generation equations.

As with any high-level currency, bitcoin, of course, has its disadvantages. The limited supply of bitcoin is one reason for the high value, as is the high rate of fluctuation. Investing in bitcoin provides opportunities to both lose and make substantial profits, and thus, is a difficult future to forecast. There are few fundamental analyses that can accurately predict daily returns on bitcoin due to its short history and high fluctuation rates, but the longer bitcoin persists as a consistent cryptocurrency, the more accurate predictions are apt to be, especially as we approach the time for five-year bitcoin adoption predictions as evaluated by market specialists and veteran traders analyzing future market ranges and currency trends.

The 5-Year Bitcoin Adoption Prediction

As of January of 2020, the value of bitcoin is currently at an all-time high, as is the hash rate, as of late fall of 2019. The hash rate repeatedly hit all-time highs during 2019, legitimized by the introduction of products like Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency, and features such as transaction batching and SegWit. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency with a worldwide presence and adoption as a payment platform by a wide span of organizations as of January 2020. Because of this, cryptocurrency is also volatile to growth in value due to global tensions. One noted increase as an example of this was the rise as tensions between the United States and Iran hit a high-point.

Despite the heavy presence of bitcoin in the United States, China is currently the leading competitor in blockchain. This is even more important when considering that bitcoin has capitalized on the cryptocurrency market, with a market share over three times more than its closest competitor. In addition, bitcoin has a solid all-around capitalization, with developers continuously making contributing updates to network mobility and transaction fees that speaks to its overall value.

Furthermore, bitcoin’s history of value increase due to geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors is set to continue to rise, as we see Brexit play out, tensions between the United States and Middle Eastern countries continue, trade agreements pass between China and the United States, and tensions rise in major digital cities like Hong Kong.

Predictions by Market Experts

With the volatility of bitcoin, multiple market experts have made five-year bitcoin adoption predictions. Tom Lee, the ex-Chief Equity Strategist of JP Morgan, has predicted a steady increase in the user-base and corporate investment in bitcoin after May of 2020. Fran Strajnar predicts that an increased rate of adoption will be directly proportional to an increased rate in value. Bobby Lee, CEO of China’s first exchange, believes that bitcoin market capital might reach $7 trillion by the end of the five year prediction period, surpassing the market cap of gold, leading to stability and global liquidity through the next five years. John McAfee, a veteran trader, believes that, in 10 years, “everything will be cryptocurrency”. Tim Draper, of Venture Capitalist, predicts that bitcoin will peak at 5% of the worldwide currency market by 2023. Despite the variance in the predictions for an already varied currency market, most predictions across the board are categorically optimistic to mixed degrees.

Factors of Increase

A number of factors affect the prospective rise in the value and hash rate of bitcoin, as the leading cryptocurrency on the market, and according to some experts, on the way to becoming a consideration in the top currency markets of the world. As aforementioned, some of these factors include increased tensions between leading trading companies and economic world powers. Conversely, good news in leading economic powers such as the United States is cause for investors in leading blockchain areas such as China to invest in the United States and Euro-centric business prospects via bitcoin, adding to both the amount of users and the overall value.

Similarly, large investors entering the virtual currency market is also a viable cause for an increase in the overall market, as is the entrance of new cryptocurrency instruments. Both promote overall confidence in the stability of the virtual currency market and increase the probability of large scale trades and trades by more conservative investors.

A rough estimate between 2020-2021

Potential for Decrease:

Despite the number of optimistic predictions for bitcoin, bitcoin, and in turn, cryptocurrency, is still in its early stages and vulnerable to high rates of fluctuation. Some experts emphasize that market history, while helpful, cannot be trusted to be entirely accurate in the prediction of future trends for a recently maturing market, with a new onslaught of active participants since its original conception.

These analysts also emphasize the importance of user base expansion and worldwide adoption in the expected value increase of bitcoin, mimicking a conceptual parabolic advance as introduced by Peter Brandt. Without the traction of expansive adoption, the experts worry that bitcoin will have difficulty continuing to gain traction, and will not reach the levels expected of it as predicted optimistically by other analysts.

Conclusion:

Due to a history of rapid advancement and an increase in hash rates and value, most experts are optimistic about the continued rapid growth of bitcoin as a worldwide cryptocurrency, potentially viable for a spot on the worldwide currency market, should growth continue exponentially on-trend. However, other experts warn against the dangers of loss of traction within a five-year adoption prediction that may lead to a decrease in both value and worldwide reach.

Despite an $800 fall on Wednesday, bitcoin's broader trend remains bullish, with prices holding above the higher low of $9,075 (Feb. 4 low).

However, yesterday's bearish engulfing candle has shifted risk in favor of a drop to that level.

A move back above a short-term moving average at $9,800 could force sellers to reassess their positions.

Bitcoin (BTC) took its biggest daily fall in three months on Wednesday, potentially trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market.

Prices were rejected near $10,300 during the U.S. trading hours and fell sharply by $800 to levels near $9,300 in the 30 minutes to 22:00 UTC before closing the day near $9,600 – down over 5.5 percent on the day. That’s the biggest single-day drop since Nov. 21, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

Bitcoin fell by nearly 6 percent from $8,600 to $8,085 on Nov. 21. Since then the cryptocurrency has had 44 down days, although the losses have been largely moderate.

As can be seen above, bitcoin has dropped by more than 3 percent in just 13 days in the last 4.5 months and in five days so far this year. These numbers, when taking into account bitcoin’s solid rally from $6,850 to $10,500, indicate market sentiment has been quite bullish since the start of the year.

As a result, Wednesday’s 5.5 percent slide could be referred to as a bull breather or pullback. The slide was expected following the confirmation of the golden crossover – the bull cross of the 50- and 200-day MAs – on Tuesday. The golden cross is a lagging indicator and often marks temporary market tops.

Bitcoin, however, rose back above $10,000 on Tuesday, seemingly opening the doors for a re-test of the recent highs above $10,500, only to plunge again. As a result, Wednesday’s drop may have trapped some buyers above $10,000.

That said, the broader trend is still in the bullish zone with prices holding well above key support near $9,100. At time of writing, bitcoin is changing hands just below $9,620 on Bitstamp, while its global average price, as represented by the BPI, is seen at $9,626.

Daily chart

Bitcoin has printed a series of higher lows and higher highs over the last two months. That bullish structure is intact despite the sudden price drop from $10,500 to $9,500 and would be only invalidated if and when prices find acceptance under $9,075, a higher low created on Feb. 4.

However, the risk of a slide to $9,075 has increased with Wednesday’s losses, which have activated twin price-negative cues: a big bearish engulfing candle and a new lower high at $10,300 (marked by arrow above).

So, the bulls need to act soon by pushing the cryptocurrency above the descending five-day MA at $9,800. A sustained break above the short-term average may cause some sellers to rethink their bias.

A break above Wednesday’s high of $10,300 would be a stronger confirmation of the continuation of the uptrend.

4-hour chart

Bitcoin remains trapped in a descending broadening channel, as seen on the candlestick chart (above left). Meanwhile, it has charted a head-and-shoulders pattern on the line chart (above right).

A break below the neckline support at $9,575 would confirm a head-and-shoulders breakdown and strengthen the case for a slide toward $9,000.

If prices again defend the 200-candle average at $9,400, the selling pressure would likely weaken, allowing scope for a stronger bounce.","Cryptocurrencies could not exist without cryptography. Advances in this field can have far-reaching impacts on blockchain technology and its potential. We will examine the opinions of industry experts on the latest cryptographic advances and their potential for cryptocurrencies.

Zero knowledge proofs: more than just privacy

Director of research at blockchain firm Blockstream and mathematician Andrew Poelstra told Cointelegraph that zero-knowledge proof (ZK-Proof) systems are “one of the most exciting areas of development” in the cryptography space. This kind of cryptography is known and appreciated for being the basis of privacy-preserving solutions.

ZK-Proofs are the basis of the privacy-preserving technology included in so-called anoncoin Zcash (ZEC). According to Poelstra, cryptographers have made significant progress in the application efficiency of this technology and now work “with more robust and well-accepted cryptographic assumptions.”

Blockchain firm Suterusu is currently working on implementing ZK-Proof-enabled privacy as a second-layer solution on top of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s blockchains. The company’s chief technology officer Huang Lin — who claims to have researched cryptography for over a decade — told Cointelegraph:

“Efficient zero-knowledge proofs, when they are applied to decentralized anonymous payments, can significantly improve both its privacy and performance.”

Lior Yaffe the co-founder and managing director at Jelurida — the firm behind blockchains NXT, Ardor and Ignis — also said that ZK-Proofs can have a very positive influence on scalability. He explained:

“Instead of generating large blocks of transactions and propagating them through the network miners can use ZKP to generate small data sets only showing the account balance changes plus a cryptographic proof that no double spend occurred.”

Syscoin (SYS) co-founder and lead core developer Jag Sidhu said that new recursive ZK-Proofs could allow for private transactions that are cheaper, smaller and just as fast as normal transactions.

ZK-Proof-enabled Bitcoin sidechains

In the past, Poelstra suggested that ZK-Proofs also allow the development of trustless sidechains, which could bring the functionality of altcoins to Bitcoin (BTC). In February 2019, he illustrated the requirements of such a system while talking to Forbes:

“I think that now if we want to do a real two-way peg, we probably need to get like full, efficient, general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs, and we need a way for Bitcoin validators to be able to validate what’s happening on the sidechain before allowing pegs to come back.”

When Cointelegraph asked him about developments in ZK-Proof-based trustless sidechains, Poelstra explained that much work has to be done before such systems become feasible. He explained that efficient ZK-Proofs would enable verifying if the rules of another blockchain were followed, and Ethereum scaling solution Plasma in an example of this.

Still, Poelstra also explained that employing such techniques for sidechain verification “would require new proof systems which are many orders of magnitude more efficient.” Furthermore, to implement such systems researchers would first need to solve complex incentive problems. He concluded:

“As a community we continue to move forward toward these goals but we're still a long way away.”

While a promising field of development, Bitcoin sidechains so far had only limited success. In fact, as of mid-October 2019, only almost $77 million of Bitcoin — about 0.054% — were locked on sidechains. During the same month, Blockstream CEO and co-founder Adam Back gave an apparent reason for the slow sidechain development when he said that there’s a greater financial incentive to creating altcoins compared to building on Bitcoin.

ZK-Proofs can make Bitcoin more private

Poelstra told Cointelegraph that ZK-Proofs can also make Bitcoin more private and cited Taproot as an example. He explained that Taproot can potentially render any transaction mostly indistinguishable from one another on the blockchain. Still, he noted that “transaction amounts and the transaction graph are still exposed, which are much harder problems to address.”

Lin explained that Suterusu is focused on the development and implementation of “setup-free, efficient zero-knowledge proof scheme with an almost constant proof size tailored for confidential payment in smart contract platforms.”

The firm’s system allows for moving the cryptoasset from the main blockchain on its second-later network and the move it while concealing “both the sender and receiver identity and also the transaction amount.” Furthermore, the solution supports smart contracts. He also expressed the idea that the cryptocurrency space should focus more on privacy.

Post-quantum cryptography

Sidhu also suggested that recent developments in post-quantum cryptography are worth looking into. This kind of cryptography focuses on ensuring that data can still be encrypted and safe from prying eyes once quantum computing reaches maturity. It also addresses fears that recent advances in quantum computing could lead to the end of cryptocurrencies.

Mostly, post-quantum cryptography designs algorithms in a way that attempts to nullify the advantages of quantum computing when compared to traditional computing. He also suggests that Bitcoin was designed with the threat of quantum computing in mind:

“Satoshi saw this coming, which is why he created one way hashes as addresses instead of public keys, as public key cryptography is susceptible to quantum brute force attacks. [...] This is also why there is a change address strategy for every wallet.”

Developments in cryptography and their impact on crypto

Yaffe said that multiparty computation (MPC) is one of the most active areas of research in cryptography. He explained the function of MPC to Cointelegraph in the following way:

“MPC enables entities which do not trust each other and might even be negligent or malicious to perform together a computation and agree on the result.”

The consensus algorithms of blockchains are one example of MPC, and progress in this space can bring disparate kinds of progress to the cryptocurrency space. Yaffe also cited verifiable delay function (VDF) as another major development, explaining that it is similar to the algorithms allowing for proof-of-work mining, “but unlike mining, VDF is impossible to parallelize opening the potential for equalizing the playing field for small miners.” Yaffe’s shared with Cointelegraph his prediction of how future blockchains will work:

“Using all of the above I expect future blockchain products would resemble a blob of information for an outside viewer while users actually holding the keys will be able to see the full history of their transactions. Some of these technologies are not ready for mainstream usage yet [...] but in the last few years there were many improvements in this area and it keeps improving quickly.”

While not a sidechain, Sidhu’s Syscoin bridge allows users to move value across blockchains without intermediaries or custody just with cryptographic principles. He explained:

“It was meant to be a step in the direction of the cross-chain consensus vision we have where users should be freely able to move across any chain generically choosing attributes such as security, convenience (performance) and technical features of the chain.”

Poelstra also cited interactive multisignatures and explained that this kind of technology significantly simplifies complex contracts such as escrows or the hash timelock contracts needed for the Lightning Network to function. More precisely, this kind of cryptography allows for such contracts to be expressed as a single signature.","Source: Lumi

Now it is possible to withdraw crypto to a credit card in Lumi Wallet and the first transactions come with lowered fees.

There are a couple of crypto wallets that position themselves as all-in-one solutions for cryptocurrency operations. Lumi Wallet, after the latest update, is one of a few to actually withstand those claims, allowing both the purchase and withdrawal of crypto to a credit card.



Why does it matter?



Basically, wallets were developed to make interacting with your crypto assets easy. You hold your currencies, transfer them, exchange them, and that’s it. Such basic functionality is provided by any wallet on the market, but the game changes when fiat-to-crypto transactions come into play.



As more and more users want to easily buy and withdraw crypto to a credit card, it becomes a challenge for wallet developers to provide such functionality:



Firstly, the wallet needs to be technologically developed enough to provide and sustain such functions.



Secondly, it has to receive the credentials and licenses needed to interact with banks and card issuers.



This presents a major obstacle for many wallets.



Fortunately, Lumi Wallet has passed the test of technology and institutional trust and now it is possible to not only buy crypto in-wallet, but also to withdraw it to a credit card in the currency of your choice.

How to exchange crypto to fiat in Lumi Wallet?



The process is quite simple:



First of all, install the iOS/Android application.



After opening an existing wallet or creating a new one, follow these instructions:



1. Enter the amount of money you want to withdraw.

2. Enter your email and check the inbox to verify it.

3. Fill in card details and confirm Your ID.

4. Wait for an email to confirm your withdrawal.



That’s it - your crypto is on the way!

The issue with anonymity



Some users might say “But Lumi positions itself as an anonymous wallet, how does it link with KYC verification?”. The answer is that during the process of withdrawing crypto to a credit card, you aren’t sharing any new information with the Lumi application - all the operations connected to the verification process are performed through Simplex externally.



Unfortunately, there is no legal way to avoid this procedure if you want to use your credit card, but partnering with a trusted verification provider, Lumi makes sure that it allows you to still have full comfort of using familiar payment methods without compromising your personal data in-wallet.

Good news for early birds!



And for those who will use the wallet to sell crypto right after the update, Lumi Wallet has prepared a nice offer: for the first couple of weeks there will be no fee from Lumi Wallet’s side, so if you want to make gains - there is no better time!","The attorney general of Israel has said that the country’s banks cannot institute a blanket ban on serving cryptocurrency companies, in comments reported by Globes.

Dr. Abihai Mandelblit told a court in Tel Aviv that banks could not refuse to serve the sector as a rule, and that judgements should be made on a case by case basis to determine money laundering risks.

The comments come in stark contrast to views expressed by the Israeli central bank, which earlier appeared to back the industry in refusing to provide banking services to companies within the crypto sector.

If the court comes to back the view of the attorney general, it has been reported that this would help stabilize the crypto sector in Israel, which has so far been stifled by a lack of banking support.

In common with banks in some other parts of the world, Israeli banks have so far refused to serve crypto companies, even in providing basic services like bank accounts. The difficulties also extend to transactions made where the source of funds is cryptocurrency dealings, as per the case in which the attorney general made the comments.

Mandelblit’s view opposes both the expressed words of the Bank of Israel and its official guidance to Israeli banks, leading some within the sector to become hopeful of a change in policy direction.

The attorney general said the position is based on a series of recommendations made by government agencies, working alongside a team of ministers headed up by Adv. Erez Kaminitz.

Concerns over money laundering and terror financing have led banks in some parts of the world to tighten up their service levels to cryptocurrency businesses. Aside from Israel, India is a notable example, where the country’s Reserve Bank of India effectively said banks were not permitted to serve crypto businesses.

This led to a court case before India’s Supreme Court, with a final decision pending. In the interim, the move by the bank has destroyed the emerging crypto sector in India, with many companies closing their doors or moving overseas to more appropriately regulated jurisdictions.

While the risks of money laundering and terror financing must be controlled by regulators and central banks, many within the Israeli crypto sector will be hoping the attorney general’s words bring clarification to the issue.

Commenting on the development, James Putra, director of product strategy at TradeStation Crypto, said: “Last month we announced our crypto offering is available for traders across Illinois, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin. We’re excited that traders in South Dakota, Alaska and our long list of other states now have another way to participate in the cryptocurrency markets through a trusted and familiar brand.”

Being a broker in a crowed of exchanges

Unlike most of the brokers, TradeStation offers self-directed traders via its online brokerage model and aggregates multiple pools of liquidity in a consolidated market data feed combined with an order-routing system.

As seen on its website, the platform offers trading services with five digital currencies – Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and XRP. While there are five fiat-based pairs, two are crypto-to-crypto pairs – ETH/BTC and LTC/BTC.

Notably, to use TradeStation Crypto’s services, users also need a TradeStation Securities equities account as it has “an arrangement with TradeStation Securities so that the fiat needed for your crypto purchases can be transferred in from your TradeStation Securities equities account and the proceeds when you sell crypto in exchange for fiat can be transferred into your TradeStation Securities equities account.”","Bitcoin has just moved into positive territory.

In an interview with a local business newspaper, Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) CEO Stig Kjos-Mathisen said his crypto trading platform had successfully developed payment infrastructure that will allow customers on Norwegian Air to purchase tickets with digital assets.

“Everything is ready to go from our side”, Kjos-Mathisen said in the interview. NBX aims to roll out the new feature to Norwegian customers sometime later this year, possibly as early as the spring.

Kjos-Mathisen is the son-in-law of Bjørn Kjos, the founder and CEO of Norwegian Air, who has been involved in NBX since it launched in 2019. The plan has always been to use the exchange to offer cryptocurrency support for airline ticket purchases.

In September, one of the oldest banks in Norway acquired a 16.3 percent in NBX for a reported $1.6 million. The exchange opened for beta users last September and is now accepting general customers.

Founded in 1993, Norwegian Air Shuttle is the largest airline in Scandinavia and the third-largest low-cost airline in Europe. It flies to destinations all across Europe and North Africa, as well as selected cities in the Americas.

Following extensive cost cuts, the company reported its best-ever quarterly result last October, with a pre-tax profit of 2.2 billion Norwegian kroner (roughly US$215 million). The airline carried over 37 million passengers in 2018, its highest ever figure within a single year.

It is unclear so far which digital assets will be supported on NBX or for ticket payments. The founder’s son, Lars Ola Kjors, is believed to have bought 3.5 million NOK ($404,000) worth of bitcoin (BTC) in 2017 before the cryptocurrency hit its all-time high of around $20,000.",,

In an announcement on Thursday, the company said it is considering opportunities to divest itself of the limited assets associated with the exchange, launched in early 2018, due to the regulatory environment, security risks and competition from peers.

“In order to concentrate its focus on cryptocurrency mining, Riot has opted to sunset further development of Riot’s U.S.-based digital currency exchange,” the company said in a statement.

Riot has hired Chicago-based investment bank XMS Capital Partners to advise on potential strategic deals and the search for new growth opportunities.

The announcement came on the heels of Colorado-based Riot’s mining expansion in Oklahoma City. Riot installed an additional 1,060 Antminer S17 Pro devices from Bitmain on Feb. 11.

Previously, the company deployed 3,000 of the same AntmMiner model in January, having announced in December it would purchase 4,000 of the mining machines from Bitmain for $6.35 million. The firm expects to boost its bitcoin computing power by 240 percent with the latest additions.

While it dedicates hashing power to a variety of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC), Riot will sharpen its focus on bitcoin mining in the future, the company said.

Riot’s stock was trading at $1.42, down 5.33 percent, as of the Thursday market close after announcing the increased focus on bitcoin mining, according to data from Yahoo Finance.

Riot was originally a biotechnology company and it pivoted to blockchain in October 2017. The company changed its name from Bioptix to Riot Blockchain. During the transition, it had considered business opportunities in banking, cryptocurrency trading and digital wallets.","How to Check the Bitcoin Price, Hashrate, Data – The 21 Best Monitoring Sites

As bitcoin grows in popularity and recognition worldwide, resources dedicated to providing in-depth and diverse stats on all things crypto have exploded onto the scene and continue to proliferate rapidly. This post lays out 17 of the best sites, and divides them into basic categories such as checking price, viewing network visualizations, and more.

Digging Into Bitcoin Data

The proliferation of data available to those looking to geek out on all things bitcoin, or simply check the prices with their morning coffee, can be overwhelming for sheer volume. In the interest of helping readers navigate this fun and a useful deluge of stats, facts, and knowledge, news.Bitcoin.com has sifted through some of the most beneficial sites, and organized them for your perusal. It should be noted that many of the sites listed provide multiple types of data, and there is often significant overlap between the categories.

Info-Rich Price Checking

Perhaps first and foremost on every bitcoiner’s mind is the price. As much as ‘number go up’ may be a silly meme mocking fair-weather crypto fans, when the number does go up, it nonetheless makes most everyone happy. The following are sites for checking crypto prices that also provide rich stores of data and a wide array of information for deeper analysis.

bitcoinwisdom.io – For a truly old school way to check prices across popular exchanges, and view corresponding charts, bitcoinwisdom.io is a solid choice. The classic site affords users the opportunity to check prices in terms of their preferred trading pairs.

bitinfocharts.com – Covering price, volume, transaction value, fees, block time, block size, difficulty, hash rate, mining profitability, and even wealth distribution — not to mention a plethora of other metrics like social media stats — bitinfocharts.com presents a wealth of information and charts all at a glance.

coinmarketcap.com – Many cryptocurrency users find Coinmarketcap especially useful for its comprehensive historical data section, allowing analysis back into the “ancient days” of crypto more than five years ago, and highlighting milestones such as highs and lows in the lives of various assets. Of course, the site and its mobile app are very popular for simply checking crypto prices as well.

markets.bitcoin.com – For a quick, clean check of prices with some interesting special features, the Bitcoin.com markets page is a handy resource. The Gainers & Losers tab shows at a glance which crypto assets are doing the best in the last 24 hours as far as increasing value, and which are not doing so hot. Further, featured SLP token performance can be monitored via the Featured Tokens tab.

messari.io – Much more than just a place to check prices, Messari specializes in research, news, and analysis, and like bitinfocharts.com, provides a wealth of metrics as well as advanced options for downloadable info, customizations, and access to professional research. Some of the features require a paid subscription, but the free information alone is fairly extensive.

Cool Network and Price Visualizations

Checking prices is nice and all, but what about bitcoin transaction and network data coming alive in the form of animated pictures and sounds? For the right-brained analyst out there, the following cool visualization resources are a nice aid in understanding Bitcoin network activity.

bitcoinal.com – Segueing nicely from the last section on price, bitcoinal.com provides a simple-but-fun, customizable price chart which depicts the current bitcoin price in terms of weather. When the price falls, a snowy scene is shown. Conversely, when things are looking green, a springtime scene appears. For those feeling down in bearish markets, just switch the time frame to a longer overview, and the sun will likely come out.

bitcoincity.info – Bitcoincity.info shows transactions as cities occurring “on the road to the blockchain.” Each city has different characteristics depending on the transaction data. Depending on the various values, colors, building size, and shape vary, and users can customize the display.

bitcoinmonitor.com – Probably the oldest such transaction and block visualizer out there, this site has been ticking since 2011, and shows transactions (higher values are higher on the chart) and the creation of new blocks.

bitlisten.com – Probably the most relaxing way to dig into transaction data, Bitlisten turns bitcoin transactions into wind-chimes, with larger transactions being lower in pitch. Users can even choose one of three instruments.

dailyblockchain.github.io – Another cool real-time transaction visualizer, reminiscent of peering into an electron microscope and watching tiny lifeforms (bitcoin transactions) proliferate in zoomable, massive space. Nodes and color-coded inputs and outputs are shown. — BTC transaction data at its trippiest.

fiatleak.com – Fiat Leak shows live conversion of various fiat currencies to crypto, based on the countries where the transactions originate. Tiny bitcoin orbs shoot out from fiat currencies at the bottom of the visual, and land in their respective nations, giving users a bird’s-eye view of the current global situation where fiat-to-crypto conversion is concerned.

Social Markers

Nowadays many in the space practically live on crypto Twitter and Telegram. They also consume mainstream media which increasingly covers bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. As such, more and more sites have begun to offer data and metrics derived from social media activity and social perceptions.

coingecko.com – Coingecko has a handy feature for checking a coin’s social media status by analyzing stats from Reddit, Telegram, Facebook, and Twitter. The info is seated right next to coin price, making for convenient and quick reference.

Fear and Greed Index – Alternative.me has a handy crypto dashboard with a fear and greed index designed to “save you from your own emotional overreactions.” Viewing fear and greed over time can give bitcoiners an idea when the market is likely overreacting one way or another. Whether that means people panic-selling when they should hodl, or buying up everything at an unreasonably high price just before a correction. The index is formed via data from five areas: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media, surveys, and dominance.

lunarcrush.com – Lunarcrush.com is focused on “social listening for crypto,” with its own scoring system. The site lists some metrics viewable only with the creation of a free account, but the “Galaxyscore,” and a feed which ranks crypto posts across the web as bullish, bearish, or neutral, are available to view without an account. Lunarcrush also provides data on influencers in the space.

Hashrate and Hash Distribution

Seeing which mining pools wield the most hash power, and the respective hashrates for various coins, is another critical metric for keeping a finger on the pulse of crypto. Luckily there are some great resources available.

blockchain.com – Blockchain.com shows popular mining pools’ respective market shares (estimated hashrate distribution) in pie graph form, over intervals of 24 hours, 48 hours, and four days.

coin.dance – For bitcoiners interested in comparing multiple data points and seeing the respective hashrates of BTC, BCH, and BSV side by side, Coin Dance is an indispensable tool. The site provides data on daily average block sizes, transactions, transactions per block, daily average fees in USD and satoshis, daily bitcoin fee/block reward ratio, and total hashrate by mining pool, among others.

data.bitcoinity.org – A wealth of information and clean, data-rich charts can be found at data.bitcoinity.org detailing the various bitcoin mining pools and their hashrates. Price info such as bid/ask spread data across multiple exchanges is also viewable.

Specialized/Technical Resources

Heading to the deeper end of the data and analytics pool, the following sites probably aren’t for the average bitcoin fan who just wants to check the price and some other basic metrics, but they nonetheless provide important info relating to the bitcoin network.

bitnodes.io – For users wanting to check up on the status of bitcoin nodes around the globe, this site provides detailed info on active nodes as well as clean and beautiful visualizations of the bitcoin network. To check up on Bitcoin Cash nodes, bchnodes.online provides a similar resource.

luke.dashjr.org – This resource is a handy pie chart overview, listing bitcoin node branches.

statoshi.info – Not only is the name clever, statoshi.info is an open source node monitoring site featuring dashboards on bandwidth usage, blocks, fee estimates, function timings, mempool, and more. Statoshi.info is also notable for its clean layout and clear, easy-to-read charts.

txstats.com – Txstats.com (formerly p2sh.info) features over 20 dashboards for metrics such as BIP 11 output stats, BIP 69 stats, batching information, and bech32 statistics. The home dashboard shows the amount of BTC held in pay to script hash (P2SH) addresses and the number of P2SH outputs. The site boasts many other metrics, including info relative to the bitcoin block size debate.

Sites Dedicated to Bitcoin Cash

While many of the sites and resources above focus on bitcoin cash as well as bitcoin core, there are also plenty of resources especially tailored for analysis of the BCH network and price. Bitcoin.com’s Block Explorer allows users to check on the latest blocks, transactions, and wallet addresses on either the mainnet or testnet. Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) tokens built on the BCH network can be explored via the SLP Explorer at simpleledger.info. For an extremely info-rich resource (which is also now available on Tor for privacy-minded users), the Blockchair Bitcoin Cash Explorer lists price, a reward halving countdown, node count, fee info, and a plethora of other metrics and data represented in a variety of lists and charts.

For fans of the aforementioned visualizers like Bitlisten, there are also sites like bitlisten.cash, for BCH. A fun way to watch network capacity and activity is by way of little people boarding buses at txstreet.com, which is useful for comparing the BCH and BTC networks in terms of fees, activity, and congestion. There is an abundance of detailed info to supplement the various elements of the fun, animated resource.

Monitor Away, Bitcoiners

As this post hopefully demonstrates, there is a veritable deluge of information, resources, tools, statistics, and services available for keeping abreast of all things bitcoin. There are of course many more resources than listed here, and finding cool new sites delivering unique metrics in a compelling fashion is part of the fun. So, whether one wants to check up on active nodes in the network, or simply see how many Big Macs their stash of ‘toshis can afford, the internet has got us covered.

Fidelity International has bought 17 million shares of BC Group at a price of HK$6.50 (US$0.83) per share, according to public disclosures shared with The Block on Friday. The transaction results in a 5.6% stake in the BC Group.

""The placement is further evidence that major institutional investors are entering the digital asset space. It reinforces what we believe at BC Group and OSL; mainstream adoption is inevitable and leading financial firms are making investments in companies that are committed to institutional quality infrastructure, compliance and regulatory standards,” Steve Zhang, CFO of BC Group, told The Block.

OSL is an institutional-focused crypto exchange, as well as provides brokerage, custody and software-as-a-service platform for digital assets. It recently also applied for a license under the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission’s digital asset framework.

""We’re excited to see that world-class equity investors are increasingly participating in the fast-growing digital asset sector, and we look forward to reaching new milestones with our industry-leading institutional investors,” Hugh Madden, CEO of BC Group, told The Block.



The Block has reached out to Fidelity International for comments and will update this story if we hear back.","Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales said Friday he has not seen a single practical use-case to convince him to integrate cryptocurrencies or blockchain into the platform.

Speaking at the CoinGeek Conference in London, Jimmy Wales said cryptocurrencies would not add anything useful to Wikipedia. In fact, he believed it would prove detrimental to its vision and ultimately damage the unique way in which the platform operates.

Speaking opposite Craig Wright, Wales said he tried to distinguish between the ideological and practical nature of cryptocurrencies. Wales has already turned down proposals from advocates, who asked him to consider making it possible for users to directly reward content creators and editors with digital assets.

“This is a really bad idea. It’s an idea that doesn’t actually work,” Wales said. “If you take something that is a bad idea and put it on the blockchain, that doesn’t necessarily make it a good idea.”

Wikipedia relies on volunteer experts and enthusiasts to add and edit new content, as well as to check facts and remove inaccurate or irrelevant material, Wales said. By integrating cryptocurrencies, Wikipedia would be “taking a step back” by making it easier for people and companies to pay for the content they want on the platform, he said.

“Creating a mechanism where you effectively authenticate that type of behavior … isn’t going to help with the quality of Wikipedia at all,” Wales said.

Wales also said getting creators and editors to stake cryptocurrency would “seriously harm” Wikipedia.

“To say to them, you’re going to have to pay or put money at risk in order to edit Wikipedia is completely insane,” he said.

If the platform made people place deposits, they could exclude experts and enthusiasts who contribute out of interest in their chosen topic. In their place would be people effectively competing against one another to create and edit content, as well as flag inaccurate entries, for monetary gain, he argued.

While he opposed creating incentives for Wikipedia posters, Wales said he had no problem with the platform accepting donations in different forms of cryptocurrency. Wikipedia is a charity and has accepted donations in bitcoin (BTC) since 2014.","Share Pin 23 Shares

Coinbase is going to become a credit card issuer for crypto.

Say it ain’t so?

Yep it is. And according to Meltem Demirors, Chief Strategy Officer of CoinShares, this is part of a broader trend of bitcoin going mainstream.

“Coinbase is effectively the Chase bank of crypto – you can deposit your money, trade / exchange it, lend it, and borrow against it whether with this credit card or future offerings like crypto-collateral backed mortgages. However, become an issuer in a credit card network isn’t necessarily going to be a driver for adoption – but it will be a boon for people who have their assets in crypto, who can now access a wider variety of banking services,” Demirors said.

Today’s on-ramps and consumer experiences in crypto are complicated, expensive, and primarily built for speculators, traders, and investors. However, verified crypto users doubled in 2018 to 35MM, according to research done by Cambridge University.​ ​While this is impressive, we believe that the results would have been far higher if there were lower friction on-ramps for everyday consumers to participate without heavy regulatory burdens, waiting periods, and overwhelming and intimidating user experiences focused on trading. In fact, while only 8% of Americans own cryptocurrency, 25% would like to own some, and 50% would spend it on everyday purchases. ​

CoinShares recently invested in Fold, which is part of a wave of companies focused on building on-ramps to support the next wave of bitcoin adoption: mainstream consumers. Fold enables anyone to spend and earn cryptocurrency on things they do every day – hailing a cab, shopping online, ordering a coffee, and more. Fold seamlessly integrates cryptocurrency rails with traditional payment rails, rewarding everyone with up to 20% crypto-back for spending cryptocurrency or USD online or offline with Fold at their favorite retailers.

“While Coinbase will allow people who have their capital in crypto to use their crypto assets to access credit, it’s only one part of what we believe will ultimately be a large ecosystem of companies serving both crypto holders and crypto enthusiasts in their payments and spending,” Demirors said. “As the number of cryptocurrency holders and those interested in accumulating it continues to grow 2x every year, companies like Coinbase and Fold will take an increasing share of these large market segments. They are developing compelling use cases and incentive mechanisms to onboard mainstream users into cryptocurrency will be their guide for where to earn and spend it.”","How to Find Your Nearest Bitcoin ATM

Cryptocurrency markets have experienced a few intensive weeks since the start of the year that took prices to 2020 highs in mid-February. The overall bullish sentiment is attracting more interest towards the crypto space. There are many ways to get started with Bitcoin but one the most accessible options is to find an ATM supporting coin purchases with local fiat.

Using a Crypto ATM Is an Easy Way to Get Into Bitcoin

Bitcoin teller machines (BATMs) are a great gateway to the world of cryptocurrencies as they don’t require extensive expertise and you can use them without complicated access procedures. While there are differences in how various devices function, in most cases all you need is to have a crypto wallet installed on your smartphone and a wallet with cash and cards in your pocket. But even that is not always necessary.

In order to “withdraw” cryptocurrency from a BATM, you’ll have to set an amount you’d like to buy, enter a destination crypto address – you can let the machine scan the QR code on the receiving screen of your mobile wallet – and then insert the banknotes that you want to convert into digital money. Once you complete the purchase, you can print out a receipt for the transaction. In case you don’t have a software wallet, many teller machines can also generate a paper wallet for you.

Some Bitcoin ATMs are two-way devices that allow you to also sell crypto for cash. One common way to do so is to enter a sum of fiat currency you want to withdraw from the teller machine, which will print out a ticket with a QR code of a public address you need to send the coins to within a certain timeframe. You can scan the code with your mobile wallet and transfer the preset crypto amount. Then by scanning the same printed QR code later at the ATM you can redeem the cash equivalent.

How to Find BATM Locations Near You and Around the World

The easiest way to locate the closest bitcoin ATM is to use a tracking website. Coinatmradar is the most popular option as its database now lists almost 7,000 crypto teller machines worldwide. The platform has many useful features. For example, you can narrow down your search by supported cryptocurrencies, availability of buy and sell options, and focus on a particular destination including country, city and location.

The most intuitive way to do that is by using Coinatmradar’s interactive map but there’s also a dedicated “Find a bitcoin ATM near me” feature that provides even more options. It allows you to choose between eight popular cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin core (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH), and to select the ATM locations according to their buy or sell features. You can also use the page to search for ATMs by address or allow the tracker to use your current location to ask for suggestions in your area.

Coinatmradar supports searching by countries and by manufacturers. The website provides details about each listed ATM like the exact address of the device, directions how to get there, working hours and its operator’s contact information. Because of their accessibility and running costs, Bitcoin ATMs usually charge relatively high fees per transaction. With Coinatmradar you can obtain that information as well if it has been reported by the company. Supported fiat currencies and exchange pairs are also listed.

Other bitcoin ATM locator sites often track crypto teller machines in a specific region. Findbitcoinatm.com.au was one such platform working in Australia but its website is currently offline. The Russian Cryptocoinmap.ru is similar in design, although much simpler than Coinatmradar. It lets you find BATMs on a Yandex map and lists them with their locations, pictures and other details, including working hours, supported transactions and available cryptocurrencies. Visiting an operator’s website is another option. For example, Coinflip, which is a leading provider in the U.S., allows you to explore its ATM locations online. Using Google Maps or business directory services such as Yelp can produce some results but Coinatmradar remains the best global source at the moment.

That’s what a recent graphic by startup ChartStar suggests.

The data visualization company graphed comment data over the past several weeks for the term “bullish” from several popular cryptocurrency Reddit channels (“subreddits”), each with varying degrees of moderation. One thing these subreddits have in common is that discussion about trading is clearly allowed. Also, each comment entry was tallied only once; posting “bullish bullish bullish” would count as just one comment.

Against the bullish mentions, ChartStar graphed the weekly close price of bitcoin (BTC).

Source: ChartStar

Sure enough, positive comments seem to track nicely with bitcoin prices in the early weeks of 2020 — but up to a point. After a sudden surge for the term “bullish” on the seventh week of the year, bitcoin prices declined.

ChartStar is pitching itself as a new type of TradingView, the popular charting tool for stocks, commodities, etc. TradingView does support cryptocurrencies, but ChartStar’s position is that cryptocurrency traders need new tools to execute winning strategies.

This is a bit reminiscent of a technical analysis tool known as the stochastic oscillator. A momentum indicator, it compares an asset’s price to recent price range, with traders able to set variables such as time period. This tool is used to give traders a sense of whether an asset is heading toward a downtrend (“overbought”) or an uptrend (“oversold”).

“There is a surge in optimism outpacing the trend, followed by a fall in price. This could indicate that excess optimism is a sign of the asset being overbought and is a potential warning a correction is due,” said David Gilbert of ChartStar.

Yet, the jury is still out as to whether Reddit activity could act as a stochastic oscillator for bitcoin. After all, it could be that the bullish comments are posted after short-term rallies, not before. That’s because ChartStar posted week-average totals, and rallies early in a week could get commenters chattering about it for a few days.","The Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Services (FIOD) arrested two men Monday on suspicion of laundering millions of dollars in cryptocurrency, according to a joint statement by the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5).

Authorities arrested two men on suspicion of laundering millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. (Photo: shepardhumphries)The Dutch nationals, aged 45 and 31, came to the attention of authorities in separate investigations into money laundering using cryptocurrency. Both are suspected of laundering large sums via a crypto service provider Bestmixer.io.

FIOD clamped down on Bestmixer in May 2019 in cooperation with Europol and police in Luxembourg. The service guaranteed anonymity to customers and the company earned at least $200 million within a year before it was shut down. The investigation showed that many of the mixed cryptocurrencies on Bestmixer.io had a criminal origin or destination.

The suspects made large purchases with a crypto credit card which didn’t match the size of assets and income, and several large withdrawals.

Authorities seized three kilograms of gold and €260,000(US $281,000) in cryptocurrencies, debit and credit cards with both cryptocurrencies and euros, a car, luxury watches and jewelry, and digital and business accounts.

2020-02-22,"An Irish drug dealer learned the hard way what every bitcoin investor knows: never lose your codes.

Clifton Collins, a former security guard and a beekeeper turned weed grower/dealer, lost $60 million when his landlord cleaned out the house he’d been renting and sent everything to the dump — including Collin’s fishing rod case that hid his Bitcoin codes. Without the codes, the accounts can’t be accessed.

According to the Irish Times, “Collins bought most of the Bitcoin in late 2011 and early 2012 using cash he made growing crops of cannabis. In early 2017 he had just over 6,000 Bitcoin in one account but he feared it may be too easy for a hacker to access. He decided to spread his wealth across 12 new accounts … then printed out the codes for the 12 accounts onto a piece of paper. He hid the paper inside the aluminum cap of his case containing his rod which he kept at his rented home in Farnaught, Cornamona, Co Galway.

It all went south for Collins when he was arrested in 2017 for cannabis possession and sentenced to five years in prison. His house was broken into and, shortly thereafter, his landlord sent his belongings — including the fly fishing case — to the dump.

Dump employees remember seeing fishing gear — but the garbage was soon cleared and sent to either Germany and China to be incinerated.

The Criminal Assets Bureau confiscated the 12 accounts, but can not access them either, without the codes, the Irish Times Reported.

Collins has since come to terms with the loss and “considers it punishment for his own stupidity.”","Cryptocurrency markets are on the move again: Category giant bitcoin has seen its tokens gain 40% in value in 2020 alone, and 155% over the last 52 weeks. If bitcoin was a stock, the ""company"" would be worth roughly $185 billion today. That market cap would land it right between aerospace titan Boeing and software giant Adobe as one of the 40 most valuable companies on the U.S. stock market.

Bitcoin's founders and supporters see it as ""a new kind of money."" As such, market watchers on both the bull and bear sides of the cryptocurrency debate often argue that the tokens -- currently trading in the neighborhood of $9,700 each -- will either skyrocket in value to at least $1 million, or bitcoin will collapse and die. There is no middle ground.

If bitcoin achieves a large enough scale and a wide enough acceptance to become a viable alternative to gold, silver, or national currencies as a value store, the cryptocurrency will have a bright future. If not, it's supposedly heading to zero in the end. The same goes for many other cryptocurrencies, and hundreds of them have already crashed and burned.

Pictures speaking volumes

So how big is the total cryptocurrency market as a value store today? Surprisingly small, actually:

The stock and bond markets make the others look tiny. Let's zoom in on the precious metals and cryptocurrencies alone:

Yeah, it's still difficult to see bitcoin and its crypto-peers next to the mountain of gold. I was surprised to see the relative lack of value in silver, but while modern mining companies extract more than 10 times as much silver every year than gold, ounce for ounce, gold is close to 90 times more valuable. And less than 5% of all the silver ever mined is in an investable form today -- coins or bullion. The rest has been used for jewelry, decoration, or by industry -- and a fair share of it has essentially been lost. You learn something new every day.

What's next?

So where does this leave the cryptocurrency discussion? Well, neither bitcoin nor the crypto market as a whole stand anywhere near the multitrillion-dollar value levels of gold, bonds, and stocks. Investors looking for stable assets would clearly be better served to put their money into any of the three larger asset classes, not to mention alternatives such as real estate or owning your own business.

On the flip side, let's imagine a future where bitcoin (or some better-designed cryptocurrency) becomes a viable alternative to owning gold and reaches a similar market scale. If it's bitcoin, that would require its value to increase at least 40-fold from current levels. We're not likely to see a surge like that in a single upward run; bitcoin only multiplied 21-fold during its historic price run of 2017, and the volatility of investments tends to fall as the assets grow larger.

But many investors/speculators/visionaries/gamblers (pick your preferred epithet) are betting on that bullish outcome in this all-or-nothing asset class. Over a recent 24-hour period, $46 billion of bitcoin tokens changed hands, or 25% of the entire currency. That's huge next to the average daily dollar volumes of trading in Adobe ($734 million) or scandal-stricken Boeing ($2.15 billion). It's even enormous in comparison to trillion-dollar market behemoth Apple, whose average dollar volume clocks in at $8.8 billion.

It takes a lot of traders to move that much bitcoin in a single day, including plenty of deep-pocketed market makers. Bitcoin's trading volumes have never been this overheated, not even at the peak of 2017's crypto-mania, when daily trading topped out near $23 billion.

I wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin and friends making a big move soon as the higher trading pressure either becomes the new normal or pops and drops. Whether the cryptocurrency market rises or falls, I'm content to simply hold on to my tiny crypto portfolio, which consists of a $20 ""let's try this"" whim from six years ago.","Vitalik Buterin, Co-founder of Ethereum, and Justin Sun, Founder of Tron. Source: Twitter

Tron (TRX) is a superior platform to Ethereum (ETH), claim multiple Bitcoin (BTC) people.

For several weeks now, certain Bitcoiners have been trolling the Ethereum camp, claiming that Justin Sun and his Tron are coming to take its throne as the platform of choice for blockchain-based apps and development. It might be not surprising, as Ethereans are intensifying their efforts to push the “ether is money” narrative, thus increasing competition with Bitcoin.

However, the provocations raise a serious question: just how well does Tron compare to Ethereum, objectively? Well, according to a number of industry observers, Tron is a better platform in technical terms, although it isn't as decentralized and doesn't have as healthy a community of developers.

Technical infighting vs strongman

For the sake of context, the whole Tron vs Ethereum debate was kicked off by a viral tweet from Opendime and ColdCard founder Rodolfo Novak (aka @NVK), who posted a picture of himself with Tron founder Justin Sun and Blockstream’s CEO Adam Back.

We have a plan. #Ethereum is over. Tron moving to #liquidnetwork on #bitcoin. Cc @udiWertheimer https://t.co/XEuw11PQKX — NVK (@nvk)

Bitcoin supporters were quick to jump on the bandwagon following this tweet. For example, here's Blockstream CSO Samson Mow claim Tron all-round trounces Ethereum as a platform:

#Ethereum ❌ Never rolled back (ETC) — Samson Mow (@Excellion)

Needless to say, many such tweets come from people who, like Blockstream’s Samson Mow and Adam Back, may have an interest in promoting Tron over Ethereum.

Still, some independent industry observers do agree that, at least in technical terms, Tron is more advanced than Ethereum. Glen Goodman, a cryptoasset analyst and the author of The Crypto Trader, points out that it can currently operate at greater scale than Ethereum.

""As things stand, I'd have to say I prefer Tron's blockchain to Ethereum's, due to its far greater transaction capacity,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""It can handle far more users and far more activity. But all of that is about to change when Ethereum 2.0 launches, with sharding and a new proof-of-stake model which should allow far more transactions.""

Guardian Circle CEO/co-founder Mark Jeffrey also agrees that Tron is slightly ahead of Ethereum technologically. Although, in his opinion, this is mostly a function of its development being more centralized around founder Justin Sun.

""They seem to be more or less equivalent to me,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""However, the technical infighting in the ETH community is a significant technical hurdle, especially for ETH's famous scalability issues, and Tron has a strongman – Justin Sun – defining what is and what is not Tron cannon. In this respect, Tron is stronger technically.""

These observations are backed up by data. According to Coin Metrics, Tron has consistently handled more transactions than Ethereum (and Bitcoin) over the past year.

Source: Coin Metrics

However, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin argued previously that the purpose of a consensus algorithm is to keep a blockchain safe, not to make it fast. According to him, when a blockchain project claims they can do 3,500 transactions per second due to a different algorithm, ""what we really mean is ‘We are a centralized pile of trash because we only have seven nodes running the entire thing.’”

Moreover, in 2018, researchers accused Tron of plagiarizing its code from Ethereum, among other projects, which Justin Sun denies.

The decentralization battle

Ethereum is the more decentralized blockchain. As Glen Goodman explains, ""Ethereum massively outguns Tron when it comes to node numbers, which suggests Ethereum is winning the decentralization battle.""

Goodman admits that both cryptocurrencies have witnessed a decline in node numbers over the past year, but Ethereum is still way ahead, with about eight times as many nodes.

He adds, ""For both blockchains, there are worries over collusion between different nodes, as most are concentrated in the U.S., China and Europe. Collusion tends to happen more easily when nodes are close to each other geographically, but Ethereum is notable for increasing its node spread in recent months, particularly to Germany, Singapore and Japan.""

Mark Jeffrey concurs, with his analysis focusing mostly on the role Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin plays in development.

""Vitalik refuses to take up the strongman mantle, saying he is 'one voice among many',"" he says. ""While this sentiment is admirable, it is also less useful to making technical advances quickly.""

Community and economics

Lastly, there's the question of community, both in terms of developers and the wider community of supporters. Here, Ethereum wins again.

""Ethereum recently launched its 'One Million Developers"" initiative',"" explains Glen Goodman. ""They claim to already have at least 200,000 developers working in the Ethereum ecosystem and they're aiming for the big million. Tron is thought to have far fewer developers but it's got a huge number of active users, nearly a million, eclipsed only by – you guessed it – Ethereum, which has nearly one and a half million.""

That said, Mark Jeffrey argues that Tron has a much healthier economic and dapp (decentralized app) situation.

""There are basically only six ways to make money right now in the crypto space: gambling, exchanges, and DeFi (decentralized finance) – and then referrals to gambling sites, exchanges and DeFi. Tron has the healthiest gambling environment by far. This means secondary offerings like wallets can survive by providing referrals.""

Jeffrey adds that Tron itself has been very proactive in spending money on its ecosystem. ""It will throw money into better wallets, more exchanges and better dapps quite aggressively. Ethereum has done none of these things."" (However, in May 2019, the Ethereum Foundation promised to spend USD 30 million on key projects across the ecosystem over the next year.)

It's this kind of market strategy that leads Jeffrey to predict that Tron may ultimately triumph over Ethereum. ""In the end, the platform with the healthiest raw economics will win. Tron is the clear leader in that department right now.""

This may be true, but predicting what crypto will look like in six months is tricky enough as it is, so predicting which fairly well-matched altcoin platform will 'beat' the other in the next few years is probably impossible. Still, competition is healthy, so let's hope Tron and Ethereum continue to push each other in the near and distant future. And Bitcoiners will always find someone to troll.

Ethereum vs. EOS vs. Tron vs. Tezos - How do they Compare?","Lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies is becoming an increasingly important sub-sector of crypto finance, one that may end up shaping how the underlying assets themselves are valued and priced in the markets.

While still in its infancy, the growth of crypto lending platforms has given birth to a new type of measuring metric: interest rates, which has the potential to draw in new investors while encouraging the movement of crypto capital out of storage and into markets.

In traditional financial markets, interest rates reveal significant information about the health of the economy and form the basis for almost all asset valuation models. Whether it be for calculating expected return or present and future market value, the interest rate is a key variable based on the lending and borrowing of assets.



Related: DeFi Project bZx Exploited for Second Time in a Week, Loses $630K in Ether

When individuals or businesses want to take out a loan, they normally have to agree to pay a percentage of the original amount borrowed back to the lender on top of the principal amount. This is what is called the interest rate.

Interest rates for cryptocurrencies incentivize users to loan out their crypto assets because users can earn a higher return lending their assets than they can storing them in a personal wallet or device. Rates for lending cryptocurrencies coupled with strong demand for borrowing would free previously idle balances of capital for investing, trading and generating new market activity.



For all the benefits to investors and market activity growth that an active lending and borrowing sector would generate for the cryptocurrency industry, the sector is still in early stages of development. Less than 0.01 percent of the total market capitalization of crypto was deployed in the third quarter of 2019 for collateralizing loans, according to figures by Credmark and Messari. To the nearly $1.5 billion in trade volume being generated daily, only $16 million was generated in crypto loan interest in the third quarter of last year, according to the most recent data from Credmark.

Story continues

Other signs of sector immaturity besides low volume are high interest rate variance and volatility.

Interest rate variance

Related: Mind the Gap: Why ETH Price and DeFi Adoption Aren’t in Sync

Interest on crypto deposits can vary by up to four percentage points, depending on the lending platform. This variance exists in large part because of the difference in business models between lenders.

Service providers such as Nexo borrow cryptocurrencies from primarily retail customers and lend in fiat. Others, such as Genesis, service large institutional clients and process loans in either crypto or fiat. Decentralized finance (DeFi) lenders such as MakerDAO facilitate loans strictly financed in crypto and paid out in crypto. Each one of these lenders incurs different costs for processing and custodying funds. They also attract different client segments with varying expectations of fees and service levels.

Over time, companies with unsustainably high interest rates on lending cryptocurrencies will go out of business, as will other companies with uncompetitively low interest rates that fail to attract lenders. The natural dynamics of the free market as applied to any industry weeds out inefficient business models and promotes standards of practice through competition. As the sector grows and consolidates, interest rates are likely to converge to sustainable levels.

Until then, borrowers and lenders will have to endure a high variance of rates, even within a platform.

Interest rate volatility

Interest rates on loans backed by and earned in crypto tend to fluctuate frequently, making any extrapolation of future value unstable. For example, interest rates on deposits for ether (ETH) paid to lenders have declined sharply from 1.3 percent to 0.01 percent on DeFi lending platforms Compound and dYdX in 2019. Interest rates for ETH on centralized lending platform Celsius also saw a decline from 4.5 percent to 2.75 percent in the same year. This could be a result of low demand for ETH loans propelled by poor spot-market performance of the asset. Between June and December, ETH’s market price fell from a high of $334 to a low of $128.



Volatility in the lending and borrowing sector of crypto is not surprising given the high risk associated with the underlying assets. Data from woobull.com shows the annualized volatility of bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization and trade volume, is 17 percentage points higher than U.S. stocks as of Feb. 21.

However, price volatility for bitcoin has declined over time through increased demand and investor participation. As the number of loans either financed or earned in cryptocurrency grows, interest rate volatility is also likely to decline.

Asset range variance

It’s not just rates that vary widely from one provider to another, there is also considerable variance in the number of assets supported. In general, decentralized lending platforms such as MakerDAO, Compound and dYdX support a narrower range of cryptocurrencies than centralized ones, primarily due to the technical restrictions of decentralized finance protocols. These operate entirely on-chain, therefore any assets supported by the protocol must also be supported on the underlying blockchain network. This limits the number of options for a lending platform to only ERC-20 tokens if the platform is built on ethereum, for instance.

With new infrastructure facilitating blockchain interoperability and seamless asset transfer from differing chains, DeFi lending platforms could eventually support as many cryptocurrencies as centralized ones. DeFi lenders Compound and Nuo already support lending on wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) tokens, which are virtual representations of bitcoin on ethereum. Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos are actively building out functionality to support instantaneous transfer of all assets between blockchains.

Such technologies to support inter-blockchain activity are likely to pave the way for greater asset diversity on decentralized lending platforms and help reduce the asset range variance between cryptocurrency lenders. Without a large variance between lenders, there is greater opportunity for competition on the basis of loan terms and conditions rather than the number of supported cryptocurrencies. This will further drive convergence of variable interest rates, as well as solidify standards of business practice.

Currently, the cryptocurrency lending sector is immature, with variable and volatile interest rates across platforms as well as among different sets of supported assets. However, the sector is developing and growing rapidly. In the most recent Credmark report, the total amount of crypto borrowed by users of crypto lending platforms increased by 23 percent to $900 million in the third quarter of 2019. Interest generated on these loans increased by 24 percent from $12 million to $16 million in the same time period.

Through increased competition, consumer demand and technological innovation, variable interest rates on cryptocurrency loans have the potential to converge. As a fundamental valuation metric in the traditional financial markets, industrywide interest rates would be game-changing for the cryptocurrency industry.

Interest rates present a wide audience of investors unfamiliar with crypto with a compelling and straightforward metric to evaluate the digital asset class. In addition, interest rates would also encourage the movement of idle capital away from personal storage into use for generating more market activity.

Popular YouTube crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, has been considering the logarithmic regression band for the total cryptocurrency market cap in his latest video, and based on his analysis, thinks that the total digital asset market cap could hit $10 trillion during the next bull run.

What’s A Logarithmic Regression Band?

While it may sound like AI-generated musicians for psychotherapists to relax to, the logarithmic regression band is actually the range of values to which the crypto market tends to fall back when it is not in a bubble. It is represented by the green band on the chart below.

The line forms a smooth curve overtime when plotted against a logarithmic value scale. At the peak of the 2017-2018 bubble/burst cycle, the total crypto market cap came very close to $1 trillion. However, it has since fallen back to the regression band and currently stands at around $290 billion.

Diminishing Returns Each Crypto Market Cycle

Plotting the difference between the total market cap and the lowest point of the regression band over time shows that the peak levels are becoming lower with each market cycle. This supports the theory of diminishing returns over time.

Assuming this behavior continues, we can project a potential peak level above the regression band for the next major bull run. As an example, Cowen projects this happening in 2022, but of course, it could be earlier or later than this, if it happens at all.

The potential outcome of this would be a total cryptocurrency market cap of around $10 trillion at the peak of the next bubble. In this scenario market cap is likely to oscillate within the regression band for a while before starting its climb.

But What About $100 Trillion Bitcoin?

Ah yes, according to PlanB’s stock to flow (S2F) model, the Bitcoin market cap alone is projected to go to $100 trillion. Cowen’s $10 Trillion market cap peak for the entire crypto market doesn’t sound so impressive against that prediction.

Of course, the $100 trillion Bitcoin is still some way off in the future. The projected price increases in the S2F model happen because of the artificial limiting of supply over time. The next halving will happen in May this year.

However, the $100 trillion projection isn’t due until another two halvings after that, or sometime in 2028. So, for now, a $10 trillion market cap by 2022 will have to do.

At current Bitcoin dominance levels, a $10 trillion total crypto market cap gives a BTC price of around $330,000, so that’s something to look forward to.

China’s Center for Information and Industry Development has published its latest crypto project ranking — the first this year. A total of 37 crypto projects, two more than in the previous ranking, were evaluated and ranked overall this month as well as in three separate categories.

The 16th Ranking, First This Year

The Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID), under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, released its first crypto project ranking for the year on Friday. Prior to this, the last one was published in December, with 35 crypto projects ranked. This month, two more were added, bringing the total of ranked projects to 37. In addition to the overall ranking, the center evaluated the crypto projects based on their basic technology, applicability, and creativity. The ranking is updated every two months and this month is the 16th update.

EOS remains top of the overall ranking, followed by Tron and then Ethereum. In December, Tron was in third place with Ethereum in second. This month, Bitcoin fell from the 9th place to the 11th place while Bitcoin Cash dropped from the 27th place to the 34th.

Meanwhile, Nuls dropped from the 4th place to the 10th place, Bitshares from the 8th place to the 24th, Waves from the 12th to 22nd, Zilliqa from the 13th to 25th, and Tezos from the 26th to 33rd. Some projects improved such as Ripple which rose from the 18th place to the 13th and Cosmos from the 24th to the 14th.

IOST and GXS Added

Two additions to the list of projects ranked this month are IOST and GXS. The former describes itself as “an ultra-fast, decentralized blockchain network based on the next-generation consensus algorithm ‘Proof of Believability’ (PoB).” The latter, also called Gxchain, is “a fundamental blockchain for the global data economy, designed to build a trusted data internet of value,” according to its website. IOST debuted at number six in the overall ranking. Gxchain was previously ranked but was removed in the October update. It is now back at number seven in the overall ranking.

In terms of the three sub-rankings, EOS scored the highest in the basic technology category, followed by Tron, IOST, GXS, and Steem. For the applicability category, Ethereum tops the ranking, followed by Tron, and Neo. For the creativity category, BTC scored much higher than the other projects. The second place is occupied by Ethereum, then Lisk, and EOS.

The rankings are compiled by the CCID (Qingdao) Blockchain Research Institute, an entity established by the CCID. The evaluation work is carried out in collaboration with multiple organizations, such as the CCID think tank and the China Software Evaluation Center. “The result of this assessment will allow the CCID group to provide better technical consulting services for government agencies, business enterprises, research institutes, and technology developers,” the center previously explained. The CCID provides professional services to the government, including research, consulting, evaluation, certification, and research and development, its website details.

In January, news.Bitcoin.com reported that the CCID released a report stating that there were more than 33,000 registered blockchain companies in December.

And finally, here's a tutorial on taxes for crypto traders. You're welcome.","The Cypriot securities market regulator has published a warning against three forex and cryptocurrency brokers it believes have been operating without its approval. The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) accused the three of misleading their investors that they are based in, and authorized to serve clients in Cyprus.

The three may be based overseas but have used fake addresses in Cyprus to lure clients in Cyprus and the rest of Europe, CySEC believes. As reported by Finance Magnates, the watchdog promised to take more stern actions if it discovered that any of these firms was based in the European country.

One of the firms is IcFxMarkets, a trading company that claims to be fully regulated. It offers forex and CFD, crypto and options trading. The other is Calibur Capital, a company that claims to offer trading in over 2,100 global CFDs. It also offers indices, bonds, commodities, ETFs, stocks and crypto. The company’s website claims that it’s based in London, in the U.K. The third, Naga Markets, wasn’t accessible at press time.

CySEC has always sought to impose stringent regulations on the country’s securities market as it seeks to protect investors. Early last year, the regulator called for the transposition of the EU’s AMLD5 regulations into national law. The Fifth Anti-Money Laundering DIrective (AMLD5) came into effect last month across Europe, shaking up the region’s financial industry. It also gave a legal definition to cryptos for the first time, making them legally recognized.

The transposition would help the island nation of Cyprus protect and maintain the integrity of its financial markets, the watchdog argued at the time. It also recommended an extension of the AMLD5 to encompass the transfer of crypto and the provision of financial services related to crypto.

The efforts of Cyprus to promote a sound and safe digital currencies industry go beyond regulation and into education. The University of Nicosia was among the first globally to develop the first certified online course for blockchain, as well as the first master’s degree for crypto in the world. By last year, the master’s degree had enrolled over 500 students, with the online course seeing interest from over 25,000 students.

2020-02-23,"2020 is now the best year ever for Bitcoin. Or, more specifically, the average Bitcoin price in 2020 is the highest that it has ever been, based on a volume-weighted average price. Furthermore, this news comes as a crypto analyst suggests Bitcoin’s bull run could last until September 2021.

Average Bitcoin price is higher in 2020 than ever before

The news that 2020 is the best year ever for Bitcoin comes from a recent tweet by James Todaro. Todaro is the managing partner at Blocktown Capital, an investment fund focusing on crypto and blockchain.

Image Source: @JamesTodaroMD

Todaro’s chart, available above, shows that the average price of Bitcoin in 2020 is higher than even 2017 and 2018. Although the most well-known Bitcoin bull run to $20,000 took place in 2017, this came during 2017’s end.

As such, even this massive bull run did not manage to bring the average Bitcoin price above $10,000. In fact, the average Bitcoin price in 2017 was $6,125, in comparison to 2018’s $7,657 and 2019’s $7,489. However, 2020 is the clear winner here, with an average Bitcoin price of $9,120.

Bitcoin bull run could last over another year

Interestingly, the ongoing Bitcoin bull run could also last for the foreseeable future, according to another crypto analyst. The crypto investor known as CryptoKea on Twitter argues that historical data supports a bull run until September of 2021.

CryptoKea looks at the relationship between Bitcoin price tops and price bottoms during halving events. Specifically, this reveals a pattern, visible below, that indicates Bitcoin could continue its price surge until September of 2021:

“During the last two #Bitcoin bull cycles, price bottoms and tops fluctuated around halving dates in an almost equal ratio. If this relationship were to hold true, we still have more than 570 days of bull market ahead of us, with a cycle top coming in around Sep 2021.”

Image Source: @CryptoKea

1,000 days of crypto rally

If this prediction is indeed accurate, it likely means that 2021’s average Bitcoin price could dwarf even 2020’s current average. Moreover, it would result in a Bitcoin bull run that lasts approximately 1,000 days – stretching from February 2019 to September of 2021. It also ties into other recent suggestions that the Bitcoin halving could boost the premier crypto’s price.

With that said, however, this is naturally not a given. Rather, CryptoKea cedes that there is inherent uncertainty in any predictions. Nevertheless, CryptoKea also notes that although history rarely repeats itself, it does rhyme:

“To make any prediction, this relationship might eventually not be pure coincidence ether (e.g. Stock-to-Flow driven hodl behavior could be one out of many reasons. We all know history never repeats itself … BUT it often rhymes.”","Cryptocurrency Explained on the Latest Episode of The Simpsons

Could this be a sign that the mainstream media is warming up to bitcoin again like they did before the 2017 rally? The Simpsons featured an almost two-minute segment explaining how cryptocurrency and blockchain work with the actor who played Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory.

Cryptocurrency Explained on The Simpsons

The animated family sitcom show that first aired in 1989 has featured an explanation on the nature of cryptocurrency in its latest episode. The Simpsons is now in its 31st season, and for the 13th episode of the season it brought in Jim Parsons, best known for Sheldon Cooper in the The Big Bang Theory, to explain the concept of cryptocurrency.

In the segment, the animated Parsons tries to prove that he is not a nerd and actually “super cool” by the fact that he is talking about the subject of cryptocurrency. He also fakes jumping over a few buses in a motorcycle and is filmed with piles of cash stacked behind him. The segment also features a singing ledger that seems to really enjoy it when transactions are recorded on him. The sketch is somewhat informative to anyone who haven’t heard about the topic before and it avoids mentioning anti-crypto tropes like that it is only used by hackers or criminals, which it could have done.

In a graphic shown near the end of the segment, the TV show’s creators seem to acknowledge that they know that the presentation makes them look like they have only a novice’s understanding of crypto but they dispute that and let us now that they even know who the real Satoshi is. That might be true as The Simpsons featured Bitcoin twice before 2016 and crypto was also included in a Simpsons video game in 2018.

The Big Bang Theory Connection

This isn’t the first time a TV sitcom involving Jim Parsons has tackled the topic of cryptocurrency. The Big Bang Theory aired an entire episode based on a digital assets storyline in November 2017. The episode, called “The Bitcoin Entanglement,” showed the cast of geeks and nerds learning about the price rally, suddenly remembering they mined some bitcoin a few years before and dreaming about all the stuff they can buy when BTC hits $5,000.

While dedicating a whole episode to bitcoin was exceptional for a fictional show, the topic of cryptocurrency has appeared on other series before, such as Mr. Robot, Startup, CSI Cyber, The Good Wife, Jeopardy, Almost Human, Person Of Interest, House Of Cards, Parks and Recreation, HBO’s Silicon Valley, Supernatural, and Marry Me. Recently even MTV aired an episode of a new show called True Life Crime with a “crypto expert” (Rachel Siegel) that talked about SIM swap hacks.

Top Stories This Week

Bears got their pound of flesh this week when Bitcoin prices tumbled by $800 in an hour. The crash led to significant losses across most altcoins, too. Looking ahead to the coming days, Cointelegraph’s Keith Wareing says BTC is in the early stages of a descending channel that could see the digital asset retrace to $7,500 over the next two to three weeks unless $9,500 manages to serve as support. This could spark the resumption of a bull trend, with $10,300 as key resistance and the breakout resistance being above $11,085. Earlier this week, fund partner James Torado shared historical data that suggests BTC prices will continue climbing for another 19 months. His figures revealed that, in terms of volume-weighted average price, 2020 is Bitcoin’s best year ever.

A major Bitcoin Cash investor claimed that he lost a total of $45 million in a wallet hack this week — two-thirds of which was in BCH. In a now-deleted Reddit post, DreamHost Founder Josh Jones appeared to suggest that his SIM card had been compromised — and he promised big rewards if miners prevented the transactions from being validated. Dovey Wan, founding partner at Primitive Ventures, described the attack as “really brutal” and criticized Jones for keeping millions of dollars in crypto on his smartphone. She warned this incident, coupled with a rumored dispute between Bitmain executive Jihan Wu and Bitcoin.com founder Roger Ver, marks a “slow death” for BCH.

The world learned a little more about Ethereum 2.0 this week. How, you may ask? Through an exclusive interview that Vitalik Buterin gave to Cointelegraph. At the Stanford Blockchain Conference, Ethereum’s co-founder revealed that this year’s major development will be the launch of Phase 0, with a proof-of-stake network set to come online later in 2020. From here, Ethereum 2.0 will begin life as an independent PoS network so it can prove its capabilities over time. “Ethereum 2.0 will start with no applications and will have a small number of validators,” Buterin said. It is hoped that subsequent phases would help tackle scalability issues. Buterin added that Ethereum 1.0 will only merge into the 2.0 system once the network is fully robust.

Has Bitcoin’s price adapted to the upcoming block reward halving yet? No, according to Changpeng Zhao. The founder and CEO of Binance has predicted that BTC will see more upwards movement in the future. Although he admitted that historic events aren’t always an accurate indicator, Zhao pointed out that miners will soon have to spend almost two times as much to mine a single coin. Despite his optimistic outlook, CZ expects resistance to remain in the short term. He added: “There are psychological barriers around nice round numbers. The price will fluctuate back and forth around that a bit.”

After annual profits plunged by one third, HSBC has unveiled radical job cuts as it sets its sights on a digital transformation. An astounding 35,000 jobs are going to be cut over the next two years — and retail branches will be reduced substantially, as the banking behemoth aims to simplify its operations by investing in technology. We already know that HSBC was due to launch a blockchain-based custody platform called Digital Vault by March, complete with $20 billion of assets. The company is hoping to digitize paper-based records of private placements to increase standardization and speed up processes.

Most Memorable Quotations

“I believe it’s 99,99999% we’re living in a simulation. So, mathematically, it is basically 100 percent.” Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO

“I concede that anyone who bought #Bitcoin 10 years ago and sells it today will make a lot of money.” Peter Schiff, gold bug

“I am officially raising my target for Bitcoin — and I first made this prediction when it was $1, I said this could go to $100,000 — I’m raising my official target for the first time in eight years, I’m raising it to $400,000.” Max Keiser, TV host

“No matter what, this 60,000 $BCH hack, the dispute among BCH camp between Ver and Jihan, all these will mark a slow death of it.” Dovey Wan, Primitive Ventures founding partner

“Phase 0 is the first phase of the Ethereum 2.0 launch. This will release the proof-of-stake network, which will come online this year.” Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder

Prediction of the Week

Despite being made eight years ago, Max Keiser’s prediction that BTC will hit $100,000 has never been achieved. Nonetheless, the TV host believes this estimate is too conservative — prompting him to quadruple it to $400,000. Unfazed by short-term levels of volatility, Keiser told Infowars’s Alex Jones: “The good news… is that Bitcoin at $10,000 or $9,300 is equally as attractive as it was when it was $100.” He hasn’t named a specific timeframe for this target to be met, but forecasting returns of up to 40 times makes Keiser more bullish than even the best-known crypto advocates. Heck, even John McAfee has reneged on his prediction that BTC would hit $1 million by 2021.

FUD of the Week

A court in Ireland has suffered a setback in its attempts to confiscate Bitcoin worth $56 million from a man recently imprisoned for drug trafficking. Clifton Collins, from Dublin, says the private keys to the crypto fortune are gone. Reports suggest Collins had distributed his 6,000 BTC across 12 wallets — printing out the keys on a piece of paper stored in his fishing rod case. Following his arrest in 2017, the landlord of his rented home in County Galway ordered a clearout — and it seems the fishing rod was thrown away. Collins appears to be taking the news of the loss in his stride, describing it as a punishment for his own stupidity.

Brad Garlinghouse has revealed that he is on a mission to tell bankers how crypto can solve real-world problems while remaining compliant. Ripple’s CEO says someone at the World Economic Forum in Davos recently told him that “crypto is still a bad word” — but the entrepreneur says regulators “very quickly become disarmed” when they realize the assets aren’t being used to circumvent existing frameworks.

The mastermind behind the Gemcoin cryptocurrency scheme has admitted to wire fraud and tax evasion in a plea agreement. Steve Chen agreed that he and other co-conspirators fraudulently promoted Gemcoin to 70,000 victims — fleecing them out of $147 million. Known as “Boss,” it appears the 62-year-old used his illicit gains to purchase properties and fund a gambling habit. The virtual coins he was promoting were supposedly backed by gems mined by U.S. Fine Investment Arts, Inc. But, in reality, the company did not own or operate any gemstone mines. U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said: “Mr. Chen’s promises to investors were as worthless as his non-existent mines and phony digital currency.”

The 22-year-old killed himself after losing money he had invested in a bogus cryptocurrency firm.

He had put all of his money — and some he had borrowed — into what turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, lured by the promise of high returns, according to Luke Oweyesigire, deputy spokesperson for Kampala Metropolitan Police. But Nusubuga isn’t the only one to have fallen victim.

A series of large cryptocurrency scams is rocking Uganda, turning the East African nation into an unlikely hub for fraudulent firms claiming to offer digital currencies, while preying on weak governance and low financial literacy. Other major cryptocurrency scams in 2019 involved developed economies — Japan’s BITPoint exchange lost $28 million, and con men in the U.K. and the Netherlands stole $27 million from Bitcoin users. Globally, cybercriminals stole $4.3 billion from users and exchanges last year. But Uganda is the worst hit — by far.

At least five cryptocurrency firms have closed shop and walked away with a total of more than $26 million of their clients’ money in the past six months. From students and churchgoers to army officers and government officials, the victims span Ugandan society. Robert Bakalikwira, a criminal investigations officer probing these cases, estimates that in all, 200,000 Ugandans have lost about $1 billion, or almost 4 percent of the country’s GDP of $28 billion, over the past two years.

Ugandans are better off investing their money in cows than plunging into the unknown world of cryptocurrencies. Patrick Mweheire, chairman, Uganda Bankers Association

These scams are different from those in the West, where hackers have stolen from exchanges or robbed from people. In Uganda, fake firms claiming to offer cryptocurrencies are luring people to buy in, before walking away with their money. The country’s growing crisis holds lessons for other poor nations with weak regulations unable to keep up with the sometimes misleading promise of technology.

“We have received very many cases of cryptocurrency scams,” says Fred Enanga, Uganda’s national police spokesperson. “We advise Ugandans to avoid being fleeced off their money in such deals.”

But the role of President Yoweri Museveni’s government is coming under scrutiny. It has set up a 10-member commission of inquiry, and is issuing public statements to alert Ugandans that the government and central bank don’t recognize any cryptocurrency. Yet even though the country has no regulations for the sector, the government hasn’t made it illegal to operate a cryptocurrency firm in Uganda. In parliament earlier this month, an MP pointed out that Kwame Rugunda, the son of Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda, is CEO of CryptoSavannah, a cryptocurrency advisory firm.

Museveni himself appeared to be an early proponent of cryptocurrencies. At an event in Kampala in January 2017, where Bank of Uganda Governor Emmanuel Mutebile said he wasn’t confident about the credibility of cryptocurrency, the president rebuffed him. Museveni said Mutebile was being dogmatic, and emphasized the need to embrace technology.

Many ordinary people in the country — which has the lowest literacy rate in the region — took it as a government endorsement of digital currencies. A flood of firms — some legitimate and several fraudulent — entered the country.

“Museveni is partly responsible for our suffering,” says 50-year-old Ken Wamala from the southern Uganda town of Masaka who says scams have cost him around $41,000.

The fraud firms include Dumanis Coins, whose management disappeared on Dec. 3, 2019, after collecting $2.7 million in Ugandan shillings. More than 10,000 people had invested in the company. Police have arrested one of the firm’s directors but are still searching for four others, says Kampala police spokesman Patrick Onyango. John Kalevu, whose shop is next to Dumanis Coins’ former office, says he came to work one day to find the cryptocurrency firm’s doors open, but the office empty.

Global Cryptocurrencies closed overnight in November. Andrew Kagwa, its chief executive, was arrested after two weeks on the run. More than 10,000 people had invested $8.2 million in the firm. Lion Cryptocurrency closed down in October 2019, taking with it $5.4 million in investments made by 17,000 people, says Henry Musagala, the investigating officer. One Coin, another of the fraud firms, duped 12,000 people out of $6.8 million. The D9 cryptocurrency company shut shop with $3.2 million in investments from 9,000 people.

Other cryptocurrency companies that have closed since early 2018 — leaving thousands of people confused and stranded — include Team, Dutch International, Finetegry and Fital-Science.

Employees of these firms haven’t escaped unscathed either. Sheila Nassali, a nurse by training, recalls how a Global Cryptocurrency director convinced her to join the company as a secretary and a customer. She was shocked when “the director disappeared, leaving me to face angry customers who wanted to get their money.”

Patrick Mweheire, chairman of the Uganda Bankers Association, says, “Ugandans are better off investing their money in cows than plunging into the unknown world of cryptocurrencies.”

But experts and former employees of these firms say ignorance isn’t the only problem. Muzamiru Kigundu, who used to work with Lion Cryptocurrency before it shut down, alleges that many government officials are among the owners of cryptocurrency companies mushrooming in Uganda. That lends the industry legitimacy in the eyes of ordinary people. The directors of these firms rent fancy offices and drive expensive cars to create the impression that they’re wealth creators, he says.

Uganda’s corruption — it ranks 160 in Transparency International’s index — is also to blame. Some of the fake firms were registered as companies even though they didn’t meet statutory requirements. “The major cause of the cryptocurrency scams is corruption,” says Joseph Bogere, professor of economics at Makerere University.

Ultimately, though, it’s the responsibility of the country’s “leaders and security organizations” to protect “citizens against such crooks,” says Solomon Male, a pastor. That isn’t happening yet. An already poor nation is bleeding further, while gaining an unwanted reputation.","$30M Bitcoin Cash 'SIM Hack' Sparks Wild Crypto Tales With Vague Sources

On February 21, the crypto Twitter commentator Dovey Wan published a series of tweets about an alleged SIM card hack that purportedly saw the loss of $30 million in bitcoin cash. The story stemmed from a Reddit post that’s now deleted and so far no one has provided any verifiable proof from the proclaimed victim.

$30 Million in BCH and $14 Million in BTC Allegedly Stolen in a SIM Hack

A rumor has been floating around crypto Twitter after a now-deleted Reddit post said that a major Chinese investor allegedly lost $30 million worth of BCH and $14.4 million worth of BTC. The Reddit thread noted that the investor’s SIM card was breached and within the post, the supposed victim begs BCH miners to help with the transactions. “It’s only had 3 confirmations […] if any miners/the community can help somehow,” the alleged victim stressed. Not too long after the $30 million SIM hack post appeared, it was deleted by the person who created it. Then the crypto Twitter pundit Dovey Wan published a series of tweets about the SIM hack situation and her thoughts about the deleted Reddit post.

“Breaking – BCH sim hack! Worth $30M from [a] single Chinese whale (he claimed lost $15M BTC too) He’s now asking for help from miners ..I’m talking with top BCH pool owners on this OMFG,” Wan tweeted. She then said it seems to her that the hacker was splitting the BTC into smaller amounts and she wrote “RIP BCH … only a double-spend can help this poor guy now.” For some odd reason, Wan’s tweets suggest that BCH miners needed to hard fork. “The best strategy for bcash now is an urgent hard fork it seems like …,” Wan insisted. She added:

No matter what, this 60,000 BCH hack, the dispute among BCH camp between Ver and Johansson, all these will mark a slow death of it.

Despite the fact that most of the facts from this story stemmed from a deleted Reddit post and Dovey Wan’s biased statements against bitcoin cash, a few news outlets ran with the story. The only verifiable source that can be found is a BCH address that shows $30 million worth of BCH sent from the wallet. Publications like Toshi Times and Cointelegraph both wrote about the tale and both authors noted that it was “unclear” what Wan was talking about, as far as her alleged feud between Johansson and Ver goes. The story itself looks like propaganda meant to smear BCH, especially with the added claims that BCH needs to hard fork to erase one man’s crisis. Notably, Wan’s tweets are filled with derogatory statements about BCH and an absurd solution to fix the problem. Despite what she or any of the other Twitter commentators think, BCH supporters understand a hard fork to reverse these transactions won’t happen.

The Unverified Bitcoin Mining Flood Video

The story about the so-called $30 million BCH SIM card hack is another example of how hearsay and rumors can become wild crypto stories. This particular story seemingly stemmed from the “bitcoin cash isn’t bitcoin” crowd of maximalists. Another example is when Wan shared a video tweet of a flooded mining farm in November 2018.

However, Wan was accused of sharing a video that was ostensibly filmed months prior and one person said: “This is fake – Don’t fall for the BS. Pictures/video are from last year after a flood.” “Can you prove this was from recently? Seems it’s from earlier this year during flooding,” another person tweeted.

This is a video from a last year's flood in China.Great job on the $CRYPTO #FakeNews .And after #DMOR I'm so glad I don't follow you or any of the projects you are working on/for! pic.twitter.com/1LQkxU1JSh — m3rt1x up in: $BTC $USDT $XTZ $ETH #Altcoins (@m3rt1x) November 20, 2018

“Those look like older generation Avalons, probably Avalon 741s,” crypto miner Jonathan Toomin responded to Wan’s tweet in November. “Those probably make about $0.05/kWh right now on BTC. Many Chinese mines pay about $0.05/kWh just for electricity, so they are obsolete and unprofitable.”

Many skeptics believed at the time the video Wan shared in November came from the flooded Sichuan bitcoin mine story that actually happened in July. “Are there any links/sources to back this up?” another person asked Wan.

SIM Card Story Has Numerous Skeptics and People Believe the Tale Is Fishy

The $30 million BCH SIM hack story has a lot of similarities with the flood tale and there are vague reports and accusations floating around Twitter because of it. According to a few individuals who dug further into the tale, it was noted that the SIM hack victim was allegedly Dreamhost founder Josh Jones.

Reportedly, Jones is one of Mt Gox’s largest creditors and during the SIM hack someone also signed a message with the private keys. It’s still unknown why the victim had his private keys, but yet he still couldn’t access his funds. Throughout numerous Reddit threads and a few Twitter posts, a number of BCH proponents thought the latest SIM hack story was extremely fishy.

“Are we being trolled? I don’t get it,” one Redditor commented on the r/btc forum. “How do you get a private key with a SIM hack? Something isn’t right here.”

However, the Dutch Fintech firm says it’s not aiming for fast customer acquisition.

Called “BUX Crypto,” the firm’s branded digital asset investment app will start onboarding early software testers so that they can determine whether BUX’s new platform is working properly.

BUX Crypto has reportedly moved into its production stage after undergoing testing. The trading platform’s “soft launch” version has cleared several preliminary tests that checked for potential issues with the exchange’s user interface, its order book, and data management.

Last month, BUX acquired Blockport, a Europe-based social digital currency investment platform, in order to further expand its product offerings. The Blockport company name will now be rebranded to BUX Crypto. The new entity will register with the Dutch Central Bank as an authorized virtual currency services provider under the official BUX company brand.

According to a press release, the new crypto-related service will be offered in the nine European nations in which Bux currently operates. Customers will have the option to trade with several major crypto-assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP. The firm will be expanding its development team in order to support their growth and development as they begin to introduce their product offerings across Europe.

As mentioned in the firm’s roadmap:

“We have decided to initially start with supporting a selection of six cryptocurrency assets so that our team can focus on preparing the platform for more liquid assets in the future. Our aim is to list new cryptocurrency assets throughout the coming year and include the community in the decision-making process for what assets to list on the platform.”

Established in Amsterdam in 2014 by Nick Bortot, BUX provides a commission-free investing platform that allows traders to make strategic investments in various brands and products through its app.","Credits for LTB#428 - Decentralization Philosophy (Part 2)

Confirming the move at a Congressional hearing, the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, “Every major central bank is currently taking a deep look. We feel that’s our obligation, technology has now made that possible. I think it’s very much incumbent on us and other central banks to understand the costs and benefits and tradeoffs associated with a possible digital currency.”

The US New Jersey Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez has backed Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Bill (A-2891) which supports consumer rights and proposes crypto entities to comply with a host of standards in this regard.

“Throughout New Jersey, there are ATMs that dispense Bitcoins. People see and hear about it in their day to day lives, but most are not quite sure what it is,” said Lopez.

Meanwhile, Brazil is working on an instant payments project called PIX. According to Reuters’ report, the platform, named PIX, will allow money transfers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by mobile phone, internet banking or ATMs.

Interestingly, Central Bank of Brazil President Roberto Campos Neto said PIX is being developed as a response to new digital payments methods such as cryptocurrencies. Commenting on the same, Neto said “If we think about what has happened in terms of the creation of Bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and other encrypted assets, it comes from the need to have an instrument with such characteristics.”

Amit Bhardwaj Case To Be Heard On March 17

Amit Bhardwaj’s bail cancellation petition will now be heard by the Supreme Court on March 17, 2020. Hearing the case on February 14, the SC had adjourned the case for two weeks which has now been listed on March 17.

Accused of one of the largest Bitcoin-based scam, the GainBitcoin founder Amit Bhardwaj has been out on bail since April, last year. However, Bhardwaj had earlier failed to deposit INR 10 Cr within the six months, as initially ordered by Supreme Court.

Bhardwaj who had deposited INR 6 Cr by December 18 was ordered to deposit the remaining sum of INR 4 Cr by March 31. “We make it clear that no further extension will be granted,” said the Court.

On Bhardwaj joining the investigation, advocate Deepak Prakash who is representing him at the Supreme Court earlier told Inc42

“Amit Bhardwaj has been asked to appear at the Shalimar Bagh Police Station every Monday. However, because of his health condition, the Court has maintained that he can’t be taken outside Delhi.”

The ED Mumbai is investigating the Amit Bhardwaj’s case and wants him to join the investigation in Mumbai.

2020-02-24,"As U.S. stocks tumbled on Monday by the most in six months amid renewed coronavirus fears, bitcoin barely budged – at least in terms of the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency’s trading history.

Bitcoin (BTC) was down 4.6 percent as of 6:17 p.m. UTC (1:17 p.m. ET) to $9,517. But a decline of that magnitude represents merely the biggest drop since last week; already this year, bitcoin has suffered six other single-day losses of 3 percent or greater. And due to a powerful rally in recent months, the cryptocurrency’s price is still up about 32 percent in 2020.

Such a performance stands in stark contrast with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, whose 3.6 percent plunge was the most for a single day since early August and wiped out investors’ gains for the year.

“There’s certainly a bit of fear in the bitcoin market, but it’s not anything close to the panic we’re seeing on Wall Street today, with the clear flight to safety,” said Mati Greenspan, founder of the analysis firm Quantum Economics, which specializes in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange. “Three percent is a very different figure for stocks and for bitcoin.”

The episode could renew an ongoing debate among investors over whether bitcoin should trade as a risky asset like stocks and junk bonds, or if it’s more akin to a safe haven like gold or U.S. Treasury bonds. There’s also the possibility that it’s neither — in a category of its own and largely uncorrelated with traditional asset prices.

Indeed, the coronavirus wasn’t the only news potentially affecting bitcoin prices on Monday: Billionaire investor Warren Buffett asserted in a CNBC interview that he doesn’t own any cryptocurrency and “never will.”

The plunge in stocks came as authorities globally struggled to stem the spread of the coronavirus beyond China, raising concerns the global economy will suffer a bigger hit from quarantines and delays in international trade and travel, according to Bloomberg News. The epidemic has now spread to more than 30 countries, including South Korea, Italy and parts of the Middle East.

Traditional safe-haven assets like gold and U.S. government bonds rallied on Monday. Gold rose 1.7 percent to $1,676.50 a troy ounce, the highest in seven years. U.S. Treasuries rose, too, as the yield on the 10-year note declined by 0.11 percentage point to 1.36 percent. Bond prices move in the opposite direction from their yield.

A jump in bitcoin prices in January — after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian led to heightened concerns of geopolitical and economic turmoil — prompted some traders to speculate that the cryptocurrency might be gaining acceptance among investors as a safe haven.

But in a report last week, the Norwegian analysis firm Arcane Research noted bitcoin’s correlation with gold had weakened since the start of this year.

Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of the crypto-focused firm Digital Asset Research, said in an interview he recently studied bitcoin’s price performance over the past nine years on days when U.S. stocks experience big swings, defined as a price move that’s statistically two standard deviations away from average.

On the 13 times such daily moves occurred over the period, bitcoin’s price rose an average of 1.5 percent when stocks rallied. Bitcoin’s price fell 0.34 percent when there was an unusually large selloff. Since 2011, bitcoin rose by 0.6 percent per day, on average.

“On these kinds of days where you have these risk-off scenarios, bitcoin tends to be down on the day,” Cipolaro said. “It’s not the same as owning Treasuries, and not the same as owning gold.”

The takeaway for the bitcoin market might still be positive, he said, since hedge funds and other large investors are often hunting for assets that are mostly uncorrelated with traditional markets but boast a track record of high risk-adjusted returns.

Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the crypto-focused firm Arca Funds in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview that cryptocurrencies might be slower to react to global developments than stocks and bonds because they’re still largely disconnected from Wall Street; digital assets like bitcoin aren’t typically bought via traditional brokerage accounts.

“It’s irresponsible for anyone to say that bitcoin is truly a safe haven,” Dorman said. “Look at how gold and Treasuries and equities react instantaneously to global fears. Bitcoin and digital asserts live outside that work flow.”

Federal Reserve officials led by Chair Jerome Powell have signaled recently they see the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate, but that the coronavirus could put the health of the global economy at risk. The implication is that the U.S. central bank might need to cut interest rates to stimulate markets and business activity if the contagion leads to a steeper-than-anticipated dropoff in growth.

Such monetary-policy easing might ultimately bolster the case for buying bitcoin, Dorman said, since many analysts believe that limits on the supply of new units of the cryptocurrency make it useful as a hedge against inflation.","The latest episode of “The Simpsons” delved into the complex world of cryptocurrencies, managing to break the subject down so just about anyone can understand it.

Titled “Frinkcoin,” the show listed on Fox on Feb. 24 features “TV’s most beloved scientist” and “The Big Bang Theory” star Jim Parsons as he appears on-screen to talk about “the really cool subject of distributed consensus-based cryptocurrency.”

“For cryptocurrencies to work, we need a record of every transaction that occurs. These are recorded in what’s called a distributed ledger,” Parsons (who’s definitely “not a nerd”) says.

Enter an animated ledger book that sings, in a slow blues style, a good portion of the tutorial:

""I'm a consensus of shared and synchronized digital data

spread across multiple platforms from Shanghai to Grenada.

Each day I'm closer to being cash of the future.

Not in your wallet, I'm in your computer.""

“When you use the currency, the transaction is recorded in the ledger,” Parsons continues, “and when one ledger book gets filled up, we add to a chain of previous books – that’s the blockchain.”

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

According to a press release, Parsons voiced himself for the episode, which features Professor Frink as the subject of a Lisa Simpson school essay, creating his own “Frinkcoin” cryptocurrency. Ultimately, he surpasses Mr. Burns as richest man in Springfield.","Cryptocurrency just took a giant leap towards mainstream acceptance by appearing in the latest episode of The Simpsons.

A song and dance routine explaining distributed ledger technology featured alongside a character played by the Big Bang Theory’s Jim Parsons who educates Lisa Simpson on cryptocurrency.

However, the episode also throws up a mouth-watering twist that suggests the creators of The Simpsons may know the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto – the mysterious founder of Bitcoin.

The two-minute sketch delivers a humorous explanation of how cryptocurrency works as it cuts to a cartoon ledger who croons: “Each day I’m closer to being the cash of the future, not in your wallet – I’m in your computer!”

But the real eye-opener comes in the form of a subliminal message which appears briefly on the screen.

“Using the word ‘cryptocurrency’ repeatedly while defining cryptocurrency makes it seem like we have a novice’s understanding of cryptocurrency,” it says.

“Well that is a total pile of cryptocurrency. In this system, rules are defined for the creation of additional units of cryptocurrency. They can be generated by fiat like traditional currency or just thrown around randomly or all given to LeBron.”

It goes on: “But for some reason, these crypto guys are really into computers. So we have big buildings full of energy-gobbling, air-conditioned computers solving useless math problems. But now we can’t have straws?!”

Bombshell

Viewers would need to pause the screen in order to read the almost-concealed note, but those who do will be able to read the bombshell last line…

“Also, we know who Satoshi is, but we’re not telling.”

Obviously, anyone can claim cryptocurrency is the future of world finance or say they know the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. But if the creators of The Simpsons do, people take notice.

After all, the long-running cartoon show has an impressive history in making weirdly accurate predictions.

In an episode broadcast in 2000, Donald Trump appears as the outgoing US President. While Lisa Simpson is being lined up as his successor, she laments: “We’ve inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.” Donald Trump became President of the US 16 years later.

In 1993, an episode featured Las Vegas magicians Siegfried & Roy where one of the entertainers is savagely mauled by a white tiger in their act. Ten years later, Roy Horn suffered life-changing injuries after being attacked on stage by one the pair’s white tigers.

Smart watches appeared in a 1995 episode – 20 years before Apple launched them.

Also in 1995, Lisa Simpson’s trip to London showed an exceptionally tall and mysterious building that looked strikingly similar to The Shard. Fourteen years after the episode aired, construction work on The Shard began… in exactly the same place it had appeared in the Simpsons.

The impressive list goes on. Including predicting the final episode of Game of Thrones, faulty voting machines in the US elections, the Ebola virus, Lady Gaga’s Superbowl performance and many more.

The question now, it would seem, is will cryptocurrency and the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto be added to that list?

READ: Does Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity really matter? https://coinrivet.com/does-the-identity-of-satoshi-nakamoto-really-matter/","Coming up with a list of the 100 most influential people in crypto and blockchain is hard in any year. But doing it in 2020 is particularly rough. That’s because the industry didn’t just advance last year, it went mainstream.

That’s a sea change. And it also makes “influence” a lot harder to define.

It’s no longer just looking at who’s getting funded by VCs, developing breakthrough technology, or building companies that are successfully delivering a product. Or who is a billionaire, has more Twitter followers, or is simply someone whose words carry weight with people whose words carry weight. How does someone developing a blockchain that may change finance compare with the blockchain lead at one of the world’s largest banks? How does a VC whose seed round brings potential partners and investors flocking weigh up against the person directing the blockchain arm of a big four consulting firm?

One answer is that instead of looking just at who’s creating a nascent industry, you should consider who is actually doing something with that technology on the ground. Examples we saw include using blockchains to track conflict minerals, Romaine lettuce suppliers, or shipping containers; sending money around the world in an instant; creating smart contracts that can pay an invoice or settle an auto insurance claim without human intervention; and helping people invest in bitcoin the way they would invest in Apple.

Another is that you have to do a lot of research, gather a lot of names, and come up with a process that looks at things like assets under management, the potential impact and reach of projects, the way solutions are actually solving problems or disrupting industries, and the impact that thought leaders can have on determining whether an industry that claims it can change the world actually does it. A team of Modern Consensus writers and contributors—Amy Castor, Michael Hillmeyer, Brendan Sullivan, and Molly Jane Zuckerman—pitched in. Names and rankings were discussed and a list slowly emerged.

As is the nature of this type of list—which is fairly subjective—influence often shifts dramatically over the course of a year. On this second annual list of the Modern Consensus 100 Most Influential People in Crypto, you’ll see a lot of new names, a lot of absent names, and a lot of people whose place on the list moved way up or down. And you won’t agree with them all.

But one thing did not change, sadly, and so I’m going to lift a paragraph, verbatim, that our now-departed founding editor Lawrence Lewitinn wrote for the introduction to 2019’s list:

“Before continuing, we feel we must point out a somber fact: Despite all the promise of the democratization of technology that is being promised, there remains a woeful lack of diversity among its leaders. For example, there are a few, very powerful women on this list but nowhere near as many as there should be. For there to be a revolutionary change in technology and finance, there will have to be a revolutionary change in who’s making the key decisions.”

With that, we bring you the second annual Modern Consensus 100 Most Influential People in Crypto.

No. 1. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook

Mark Zuckerberg (Photo: Facebook)

Before June 18, 2019, cryptocurrencies were a topic discussed largely by regulators, law enforcement, and a few interested legislators. By the next day, Facebook’s proposed Libra cryptocurrency project was on the lips of central bank presidents, finance ministers, and even the President of the United States. Newspaper pundits and television anchors across the political spectrum and around the globe were boning up on “stablecoins,” and the phrase “central bank digital currency” exploded in the political and financial lexicon. Mark Zuckerberg did that.

While Facebook’s CEO was smart enough to give the project a frontman (David Marcus, No. 22) and build a governance system (the Libra Association), so that he and his much-distrusted company theoretically wouldn’t control it, the scope and ambition of the project was immediately clear to anyone with a real knowledge of how the world financial system actually works. With 2.7 billion customers using Facebook’s Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram, Zuckerberg’s private currency would be in the hands of more than one-third of the world’s population.

That’s enough to move whole economies and overpower central bankers’ ability to fight off recessions. And that is what’s known as a wake-up call. Even if Libra is faltering — and we’re being polite here— its impact on the U.S. and international legal framework under which cryptocurrencies eventually operate will be enormous.

No. 2. Xi Jinping, President, China

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies had captured the mind of Chinese entrepreneurs and investors long before the most powerful man in the country lit a rocket under the industry by saying he wanted China to become the world’s blockchain leader. Then came word that China has been working on a central bank digital currency. While lower-level authorities immediately labored to make clear that President Xi wasn’t talking about other cryptocurrencies, his call to action will have a huge impact for years to come. By saying China will become the world’s blockchain leader, President Xi might well have made it so.

No. 3. Jay Clayton, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission

Jay Clayton (Photo: SEC)

Jay Clayton is top gun at the SEC, the financial watchdog that has been coming down hard on blockchain companies, such as Kik and Telegram, that raised a boatload of money in initial coin offerings during the peak of the crypto bubble. He is certainly one of crypto’s biggest roadblocks, having pushed back hard on a bitcoin ETF as he considers market manipulation rampant. We’ll likely be seeing more of him in the year ahead as the regulator goes after more cryptocurrency companies that raised funds in initial coin offerings—or unregistered security offerings, according to Clayton.

No. 4. Vitalik Buterin, Co-founder, Ethereum

Vitalik Buterin (Photo: Flickr)

At the tender age of 19, Russian-born Vitalik Buterin, known for his cat t-shirts, dropped out of Waterloo University in Canada. Packing a light backpack, he set out on a six-month adventure to travel the world and learn more about bitcoin, his latest obsession. After working on Mastercoin and Colored Coins projects, he came up with an idea to launch a new blockchain with its own scripting language for smart contracts. Ethereum was born and its native ether token (ETH) has since become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. At 24, Vitalik’s next big challenge is moving Ethereum from its current proof-of-work consensus algorithm to the faster, more energy-efficient proof-of-stake model, while keeping the blockchain decentralized.

No. 5. Jack Dorsey, CEO, Twitter and Square Crypto

Jack Dorsey (Photo: Twitter)

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has been a vocal Bitcoin advocate since 2017. But when he jumped into cryptocurrency and blockchain with both feet in March 2019 with Square Crypto—the crypto-focused part of his payments company—he immediately became one of the loudest voices in the space. A Bitcoin supporter, he brings more than just investments (although he’s bringing a lot of those). Dorsey also brings credibility and Silicon Valley clout, as well as a link to politicians he has courted at Twitter and a massive platform whose influence is keenly followed in crypto world.

No. 6. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, CEO, Binance

Changpeng “CZ” Zhao (Photo: Binance)

Changpeng Zhao—better known as CZ—created one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchanges. His is a rags-to-riches story. Having left China for Canada as a child after his father was exiled from the country, CZ has since gone on to amass astounding wealth. But to get there, Binance has become adept at moving to where regulations are most favorable, from greater China to Japan to Malta.

More recently, Binance exited the U.S. market after announcing the creation of a separate Binance.US. It also added support for lending to margin traders, launched stablecoins, and overcame a $40 million hack thanks to CZ’s frankness, huge Twitter following, and willingness to punch hard. He also spearheaded a feud against Craig Wright in early 2019 that led to both Binance and Kraken delisting BSV, the bitcoin hard fork that Wright characterizes as the “real” bitcoin.

No. 7. Brian Armstrong, Co-founder, Coinbase

Brian Armstrong (Photo: Flickr)

In 2012, Armstrong, along with Fred Ehrsam, started one of the biggest and most important exchanges and has been the CEO ever since. Coinbase went through the Y Combinator startup incubator program and raised seed capital from Adam Draper, Garry Tan, and several other angel investors. Tim Draper’s DFJ (Draper Fisher Jurvetson) and Fred Wilson’s Union Square Ventures were also prominent venture capital investors in the company in subsequent years. (Both Drapers, Tan, and Wilson are also featured elsewhere in this year’s “Modern Consensus 100 Most Influential People in Crypto.”)

Coinbase began as a platform for average Joes dipping their toes into crypto for the first time and later created an exchange for professional traders. The San Francisco company has expanded its offerings over the years including the formation of its early-stage venture fund, Coinbase Ventures, in 2018. That’s become a big business now, with very substantial 2019 investments, according to CrunchBase. It’s recently became the first pure-play crypto firm permitted to directly issue Visa debit cards, bypassing banks.

No. 8. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO, Ripple

Brad Garlinghouse (Photo: Ripple)

In 2019, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse saw real progress in the company’s goal of disrupting the cross-border payments industry and middleman Swift. More than 300 banks and financial institutions have signed on to its RippleNet real-time cross-border payment network. And Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity product got a big boost in June, when Ripple invested $50 million in MoneyGram, which in turn began using ODL for remittances, starting with the US-Mexico corridor. As of the beginning of November, XRP was used in 10% of those transactions. In terms of real-world use cases – a pursuit in which blockchain has struggled — Ripple is making real progress.

On the other hand, Garlinghouse spent much of the past year being hammered by all the other holders of the XRP, many of whom blamed Ripple’s huge quarterly sales of the cryptocurrency for its poor price performance. Ripple has more recently cut sales and XRP is up nearly 50% this year. And while Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz’ prediction that XRP will underperform in 2020 caused a big stir, he noted that Ripple’s huge holdings—and sales—were the cause. He also tweeted that he remains a big Ripple investor. Then there’s the class-action lawsuit calling XRP sales an unregistered securities offering, which Ripple is aggressively fighting.

Shortly after Ripple raised $200 million in a Series C funding round in December, Garlinghouse came fairly close to saying that Ripple will go public with a traditional IPO this year. If it comes off, that could give it a big enough war chest to fund its goal of expanding RippleNet’s banking network while still limiting quarterly sales. He’s also a big influencer on Twitter, with 240,000 followers, including a hard-core group nicknamed the XRP Army.

No. 9. Mike Novogratz, Founder, Chairman, and CEO, Galaxy Digital

Mike Novogratz (Photo: Galaxy Digital)

As a partner at Goldman Sachs in the 1990s and as CIO of Fortress Investment Group’s Macro Fund in the 2000s, before each of the company’s respective IPOs, Mike Novogratz was an on-again, off-again billionaire.

He made at least three fortunes and lost two. In 2013, he put $7 million of his own money in crypto when bitcoin was selling at around a hundred dollars a coin. Four years later he went on to found Galaxy Digital which calls itself “the bridge between the crypto and institutional worlds.” Galaxy Digital’s business lines include trading, asset management, principal investing, and advisory services.

A noted bitcoin bull, Novogratz’s views are among the most widely respected in the industry. Novogratz studied economics in university and spent a few years in the NJ National Guard afterward. He was also Ethereum cofounder Joseph Lubin’s roommate at Princeton.

No. 10. Naval Ravikant, Co-founder and CEO, AngelList

Naval Ravikant (Photo: AngelList)

Naval Ravikant is CEO and a co-founder of San Francisco-based AngelList, a platform that enables investors, startups, and job seekers to connect. He was also an early investor in Twitter, Uber, and Yammer.

Spinoffs from AngelList include Republic, a startup equity crowdfunding platform for regular investors, and CoinList, which provides a platform where digital asset companies can sell their tokens. Raivikant is an advisor to Republic, which recently created Republic Crypto, described as a “full-stack fundraising solution in the crypto space.”

Ravikant is also a backer and advisor to early-stage startup Bitwise Asset Management, which created the first cryptocurrency index fund. Bitwise also put solid facts and numbers—an eye-watering 95%—behind a widely known reality that an enormous percent of all bitcoin trades are fraudulent last year in an SEC filing. Ravikant’s academic background is in computer science and economics

No. 11. Elizabeth Stark, Co-founder and CEO, Lightning Labs

Elizabeth Stark (Photo: Wikimedia)

Lightning Labs’ goal is to speed up cryptocurrency transactions by creating a superhighway on top of the bitcoin blockchain. Although Bitcoin-centric, it works on other blockchains, too. This means the Lightning Labs team doesn’t don’t have to choose sides to focus on great tech. Even before the bubble, Stark prophesied that Lightning would become “the HTTP of bitcoin and blockchains.”

Stark’s leadership on this team comes from an academic background at Stanford and Yale. Back then when universities were complaining about how to keep Limewire from slowing down their networks, she and her students took peer-to-peer technology seriously. This year she and her team hope to see that careful study pay off as they get Lightning to scale to human levels. On Feb. 5, the company announced its beta of Lightning Loop, describing it as “an on and off-ramp” between the Lightning Network and Bitcoin blockchain.

No. 12. Wences Casares, Founder & CEO, Xapo

Wences Cesares

Known as “patient zero” of bitcoin among Silicon Valley VC firms, because he infected them with an obsession for the virtual money, Wences Cesares is a serial entrepreneur and a board member of both PayPal and the crypto research and advocacy non-profit Coin Center. His current project is Xapo, a bitcoin wallet, which he says combines convenience with the security of cold storage. The startup has heavyweight advisors, including a former secretary of the Treasury and chairman and CEO of Citibank.

Casares is bullish on bitcoin, obviously. He likens the crypto space to the early days of the internet and believes it is the biggest step forward in the democratization of money. A native of Argentina, Wences’ past ventures include video game maker Wanako Games, Brazil’s Banco Lemon, mobile payment firms Bling Nation and Lemon Wallet, and Latin American online brokerage Patagon, which Banco Santander bought for $750 million.

No. 13. Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.); Former CEO, Bakkt

Sen. Kelly Loeffler (Photo: Senate)

When we started drawing up this list, newly appointed Senator Loeffler was a lot higher up. And while she could prove a pivotal voice in the senate for cryptocurrencies and FinTech, she has to win re-election in a special election in November—and President Donald Trump may well support an opponent. Having put $20 million of her own funds into the Senatorial campaign, she likely won’t have time to do a whole lot more than toe the party and presidential line until then.

Loeffler had plenty of influence before that as CEO on Bakkt, the Bitcoin futures exchange run by Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the NYSE. She’s also married to the CEO of ICE.

No. 14. Joe Lubin, Founder, ConsenSys

Joseph Lubin (Photo: ConsenSys)

ConsenSys, the Brooklyn-based incubator started by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, just suffered another round of layoffs. But it seems to be evolving into a more normal company, rather than the original sprawling playground of goalless startups—or “venture production model.”

Actually, it is now two companies, one that will focus on software, mainly of Infura, PegaSys, MetaMask, and Codefi, which provide tools and services to Ethereum developers and decentralized finance companies. And an investment arm that will focus on “early-stage equity, liquid digital assets, and strategic opportunities.”

Then there’s JPMorgan. Reuters just reported that the banking giant is in talks to merge its Quorum stablecoin with ConsenSys. If it happens—and “if” has been called the longest word in the English language—it would be a massive boost for Lubin’s company. And, it would go a long way to explaining the break-up: banks value normalcy.

Lubin, a Goldman Sachs veteran who may or may not be a billionaire thanks to his vast ETH holdings, remains an articulate and in-demand spokesperson for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry as a whole.

No. 15, 16. Brad & Bart Stephens, Co-founders & Managing Partners, Blockchain Capital

Brad and Bart Stephens (Photo: Blockchain Capital)

In an interview with Modern Consensus last year, Brad told us he got introduced to the crypto space through video game currencies and none other than Brock Pierce. In 2013, Brad and his brother Bart founded Blockchain Capital with Pierce. They had already been funding a bunch of startups through Stephens Investment Management Group, their family office, and wanted to invest in a VC fund specific to blockchain.

They are now two of the most active investors in the blockchain space. They have funded more than 72 companies across the crypto ecosystem with a portfolio that includes BitGo, BitFury, BitPesa, BlockOne, Blockstream, Chain, Civic, Coinbase, Filecoin, Harbor, Kraken, Messari, Orchid, Radar Relay, Ripple, Securitize, and 0x.

No. 17. Gennaro “Jerry” Cuomo, VP blockchain technologies, IBM Blockchain

Jerry Cuomo (Photo: IBM)

An IBM Fellow who has more than 50 patents for Big Blue, Cuomo is a founding member of the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project.

IBM Blockchain is behind some of the most advanced, on-the-ground enterprise blockchain projects, among them IBM Food Trust, which tracks produce from farm to supermarket shelf and TradeLens, an enterprise blockchain consortium in the cargo shipping industry.

If blockchain is going to change the world to the extent that many believe it will, it’s not enough to run corporate proof of concepts. It’s got to be real, running programs. And IBM is ahead of the curve in that.

No. 18. David Marcus, Calibra

David Marcus (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)

More or less everything we said about Mark Zuckerberg applies to Calibra wallet head David Marcus, Facebook’s frontman on the Libra project. Except that his job was to get it done, and that’s not looking good. Among the eight dropouts from the Libra Association—PayPal , Mastercard, Visa, Mercado Pago, eBay, Stripe, Booking Holdings, and recently Vodafone—were the only U.S. payment processors backing Libra. And the political pressure got so bad Zuckerberg was forced to promise Congress Facebook wouldn’t launch Libra without regulators’ approval. He did get a win in late February, when e-commerce site Shopify joined the Libra Association.

No. 19. Jihan Wu, Co-Founder, Bitmain

It’s kind of hard to justify putting Bitmain in the top 20 this year, considering the string of disasters and self-inflicted wounds it suffered in 2019. On the other hand, with Coinshares estimating that Bitmain’s share of the bitcoin hashrate has fallen to “just” 66% (TokenInsight puts it at 63%), it’s hard to justify putting it any lower. Disastrous investments, terrible sales forecasts for some of its ASIC miners, the sudden ouster of co-founder Micree Zhan, plans to lay off half (!) of its staff, a U.S. Justice Department investigation, lawsuits, and a canceled IPO add up to a landslide. Basically, Bitmain hasn’t had a plague of locusts. Oh wait, there’s the May 2020 halving, when the reward for mining bitcoin blocks drops 50%.

No. 20, 21. Tyler Winklevoss, Co-Founder & CEO, and Cameron Winklevoss, Co-Founder & President, Gemini

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (via Wiki Commons).

Rowing Olympians Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss took a good chunk of the money they made from suing Mark Zuckerberg for stealing Facebook and invested it into bitcoin, turning themselves into bitcoin whales in the process. Now they are working to bring legitimacy into the market, positioning themselves as the responsible exchange. The twins are behind the New York City-based digital asset exchange Gemini and the Gemini dollar (GUSD) stablecoin launched in 2019. As a New York trust company, Gemini is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. And just this year, the firm launched its own in-house captive insurance firm to protect client cold storage funds against loss. But one of Winklevoss’s biggest crusades has been trying to get the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF. So far, they’ve had no luck.

The Winklevii also run Winklevoss Capital, which has invested in AngelList, Tezos, and Xapo, as well as Gemini.

No. 22. Marc Andreessen, Co-founder & General Partner, Andreessen Horowitz

Marc Andreessen was a major player in the Silicon Valley VC market long before embracing Bitcoin and blockchain in 2013. The billionaire cofounder of Netscape made his fortune during the 1990s internet bubble. Later, he switched to venture capital, eventually co-founding Andreessen Horowitz. The firm invested in Facebook and Twitter among other highly successful start-ups. In mid-2018, it announced a16z crypto, a new $350 million fund focused solely on the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.

No. 23. Joseph Poon, Plasma + Lightning Network

In China he is known as 闪电神—aka “Lightning God.” That’s only hype if you can’t back it up. Poon co-authored the original Lightning whitepaper and is the brains behind Plasma—a layer 2 solution for Ethereum smart contracts.

No. 24. Andreas Antonopoulos, Author, Speaker, and Bitcoin evangelist

Andreas Anotopoulos (Photo: aantonop.com)

Author of the seminal 2017 book “Mastering Bitcoin,” which has launched countless adventures in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Andreas Antonopoulos is a well-known technology expert and early bitcoin evangelist. An incredibly influential figure in the cryptocurrency community, he has founded several blockchain companies, consults extensively on emerging technologies, and is also a mainstay on the conference circuit.

With an academic background in computer science and distributed systems security, Antonopoulos was a pioneer of open-source software, having worked on very early versions of Linux. That led him to be a passionate supporter of the original decentralized ideals of Bitcoin. He’s also a fierce opponent of bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds, saying they are antithetical to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, as they remain in the central control of a custodian.

While “Mastering Bitcoin” is primarily a book for developers, in our opinion, its early chapters provide the best and clearest explanation of how blockchain and bitcoin work and are accessible for the non-technical reader.

No. 25. Fred Wilson, Partner, Union Square Ventures

Fred Wilson is a pundit in the crypto investing space with a long-running blog and over half a million Twitter followers. He has been called a loudmouth at times—and some have found his Bitcoin maximalism short-sighted and off-putting. As the co-founder of New York City-based VC firm Union Square Ventures, his portfolio includes Coinbase, Blockstack, Polychain Capital, and Autonomous Partners. As well as non-blockchain companies like Twitter.

No. 26. Tim Draper, Founder, DFJ

Tim Draper (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)

If you spot a guy with ludicrous eyebrows and a purple bitcoin tie singing really bad rap songs about the digital currency, it’s sure to be Tim Draper. The storied VC has had a long and storied career in Silicon Valley, investing in all sorts of technologies from email (Hotmail) to VoIP (Skype) to search engines (Baidu) to micro-blogging (Twitter) to electric cars (Tesla) to private spacecraft (SpaceX), and of course, cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) and cryptocurrency exchanges (Coinbase).

Draper, whose father and grandfather were also venture capitalists, founded the influential VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson in 1985 and has since gone on to found Draper Associates, the Draper Venture Network, and the Draper University of Heroes. He is also featured on the unsurprisingly named reality television show, “Meet the Drapers.”

Draper is an advocate for cryptocurrencies (obviously), blockchain, and decentralization, and in fact, bought around 30,000 bitcoin from a 2014 U.S. government auction of the seized assets of Silk Road. On Monday, he declared on CNBC that bitcoin would hit $250,000 by the end of 2022 or early 2023. Aside from blockchain, his other recent investments have focused on artificial intelligence and computational genomics. Draper has also been a longtime proponent of dividing the state of California into several smaller states, which has been less successful thus far than his technology investing.

No. 27. Peter Thiel, Founder, Founders Fund

Peter Thiel (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)

Peter Thiel is Silicon Valley’s legendary digital money merchant prince. Alongside Elon Musk, Max Levchin, Reid Hoffman, Ken Howrey and others in the PayPal Mafia, he birthed the era of fast, secure ecommerce. Founder of Palantir and early investor in Facebook, LinkedIn, Yelp and other Silicon Valley giants, Thiel was a billionaire many times over before investing in bitcoin. His partners at Founders Fund include Napster co-founder and former Facebook president Sean Parker. The fund has billions under management with a portfolio that includes SpaceX and Airbnb.

There are countless stories from Silicon Valley CEOs of how Thiel changed their lives. His Thiel Foundation gives a small number of young entrepreneurs $100,000 over two years to skip college and pursue their business dreams. One of those Thiel Fellows was Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Not without controversy, the man also funded the lawsuit that killed Gawker. He is also a New York Times best-selling author. His cryptocurrency and blockchain investments include Block.one, Layer1, and bitcoin.

No. 28, 29. Alexis Ohanian & Garry Tan, Co-founders, Initialized Capital

Gary Tan and Alexis Ohanian (Photo: Wikimedia)

Alexis Ohanian and Garry Tan have wide-reaching influence in Silicon Valley’s venture community through their close relationship with Y Combinator, which is a storied seed investor. Their portfolio companies have generated more than $20 billion in market value and they just closed their fourth fund of $225 million. Reddit co-founder Ohanian has brought his wife, tennis star Serena Williams into the crypto investing sphere. He also became a big backer of paid paternity leave after taking one to care for his wife and daughter after dangerous complications during childbirth. Expect to see more investment in building the blockchain coming from the dynamic duo. Their portfolio includes Coinbase, Polychain Capital, and Cointracker

No. 30, 31. Pavel Durov, CEO, Telegram; Ted Livingston, CEO, Kik

Pavel Durov and Ted Livingston (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)

In 2019, plans for cryptocurrencies associated with two large global messenger applications—Telegram’s gram and Kik’s kin token—were halted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for roughly the same reason: the SEC believes that both projects are unregistered securities that could hurt U.S. retail investors. Both companies say they are utility tokens to be used as a currency on their blockchains, rather investment tokens that would qualify as securities.

Telegram’s Pavel Durov convinced gram investors to approve a new April 2020 launch, after the SEC scuttled its Oct. 2019 plan. Durov and Telegram are still fighting the SEC, asking the organization to withdraw their allegedly unwarranted claims that Gram is a security, and thus far not turning over financials for their $1.7 billion ICO.

Ted Livingston, founder and CEO of Kik, has also been fighting the SEC over claims that Kin’s $100 million ICO was an unregistered security for far longer than Durov. In September 2019, Livingston announced—and then quickly reversed—a closure of the millions-of-users-wide Kik messaging app in order to focus on Kin and the SEC battle.

Win or lose, these two suits will set a precedent for future crypto projects.

No. 32. Kathleen Breitman, Co-founder & CEO, Tezos

Kathleen Breitman (Photo: LinkedIn)

Along with co-founder and husband Arthur, Kathleen Breitman started Tezos, a smart contracts platform. Similar to Ethereum, it is designed to fix several weaknesses its designers saw in ETH’s governance and technology. The proof-of-stake protocol is on a roll lately, with XTZ breaking past $2 for the first time in February.

Launched in July 2017, XTZ became one of the richest ICOs, pulling in $232 million, more than 11 times its $20 million goal. It was also among the most controversial initial coin offerings, with the Breitmans vilified after a feud with Tezos Foundation Chair Johann Gevers. After a long delay that threatened to kill the project, the Tezos Mainnet went live in June 2018 and the project appears to be on a solid footing. Tezos is still battling an ongoing, consolidated class-action suit over whether its ICO was an unregistered securities offering. It recently launched a Tezos faucet, with a small stream of XTZ tokens for testing purposes, to attract developers.

No. 33. Olaf Carlson-Wee, Founder and CEO, Polychain Capital

A Silicon Valley star who long sported a mullet, Olaf Carlson-Wee became the first Coinbase employee after graduating from Vassar. Three years later, he headed off to start his own hedge fund to manage digital assets. During the cryptocurrency mania, San Francisco-based Polychain Capital vaulted to prominence as it racked up investments from backers such as Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners. In late 2017, the firm boasted more than $1 billion in assets under management. The following year, those assets plummeted by 40%. These days Polychain is partnering with the Web3 Foundation to launch a new investment fund for projects building atop the Polkadot network. Investments include Algorand, CoinList, MakerDAO, and Dfinity.

No. 34. David Schwartz, CTO, Ripple

David Schwartz (Photo: Ripple)

One of the original developers of the Ripple consensus network, Schwartz also calls himself an “architect” of the XRP ledger. As CTO, he’s built a rare thing in crypto—a payments network that is actually being used in the real world.

Designed specifically as a “frictionless” means of transferring money globally at very low cost, Ripple’s technology claims to have several benefits over rivals Bitcoin and Ethereum, notably the speed at which transactions can be settled. That’s important, considering that the company’s RippleNet software aims to take over the old-fashioned business of interbank money transfers by knocking the traditionally days-long process down to a few seconds. Schwartz also commands respect under his @JoelKatz persona on Twitter, where his nearly 150,000 followers value his humor as much as his crypto insights.

No. 35. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.)

Rep. Brad Sherman (Photo: Official)

A smart, politically savvy opponent of cryptocurrency, Rep. Sherman called for an outright ban on Bitcoin in May 2019. During a House Financial Service Committee oversight hearing of the Securities and Exchange Commission in September, Sherman told SEC Chairman Jay Clayton that cryptocurrencies meet the needs of four markets: tax evaders, terrorists, sanctions evaders, and drug dealers. A month later, he told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that “for the richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world and say, that’s who you’re really trying to help….” He trailed off before finishing with something like “is obscene,” which sounded like where he was heading. Now that Libra has focused Sherman’s attention on the cryptocurrency as a potential threat to the world’s economic order, he’s a bad enemy to have.

No. 36. Chris Dixon, General Partner, Andreessen Horowitz

American internet entrepreneur and investor Chris Dixon is one of the most prominent venture capitalists focusing on blockchain. He joined Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in 2013 and co-leads its $350 million crypto fund. Since then, he has led the firm into investments that include cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase, decentralized marketplace OpenBazaar, and blockchain data solution Mediachain. Other investments include Chia, CryptoKitties, Dfinity, Filecoin, Harbor, MakerDAO, Orchid, and Polychain. Dixon co-hosts the a16z podcast and has an impressive 575,000 followers on Twitter.

No. 37. Tom Jessop, Head of Corporate Business Development, Fidelity

Tom Jessup

Jessop spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs focused on creating and investing in tech platforms for capital markets. In the mid-2010s, he helped put together Goldman’s investments in fintech startups, including Circle Internet Financial. He became enthralled with bitcoin long before the virtual currency was talked about in investment circles, and in 2017, moved on to join Chain, a vendor of blockchain technology to enterprises. Now working for Fidelity, he is the face behind Fidelity Digital Asset Services, a trading platform for institutional investors that launched in 2018. To date, FDAS represents one of the boldest moves into the cryptocurrency industry by an incumbent financial institution. Fidelity was important to bitcoin and really cryptocurrency as a whole, providing proof that a major financial institution considered it a serious asset at a time when it badly needed Wall Street credibility. In December, it announced plans to expand into the U.K. and EU.

No. 38. Dan Morehead, CEO, Pantera Capital

Dan Morehead is the founder and CEO of Pantera Capital, a 17-year-old investment firm focused exclusively on cryptocurrencies and companies utilizing blockchain technology. Given that the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper was published only twelve years ago, one might be tempted to think that Morehead and Pantera were the John II and Portugal of the cryptocurrency era, visiting the Americas before the Spanish bumped into some Caribbean islands on their way to Asia. Alas, the reality is less exciting. Morehead founded Pantera as a global macro hedge fund in 2003 and transitioned its focus over the years. Since 2014 Morehead has also been chairman of Bitstamp, a Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency exchange. Before striking out on his own, Morehead was CFO and head of macro trading at Tiger Management. His academic training is in civil engineering.

No. 39. Barry Silbert, Founder and CEO, Digital Currency Group

Barry Silbert started buying up bitcoin in 2012 and soon became an active investor in the cryptocurrency space. Three years later, he founded Digital Currency Group. Today the New York-based VC backs over 140 companies, including Coinbase, Ripple, and Circle. It is also the parent company of cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale Investments, crypto trading and lending firm Genesis Trading, and media and events firm CoinDesk. Prior to leading DCG, Silbert founded SecondMarket, a technology company that was acquired by Nasdaq. He cut his teeth in the investment world as an investment banker.

No. 40. Jesse Powell, CEO, Kraken

Jesse Powell is the outspoken CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform Kraken. Now based out of San Francisco, Kraken left New York State over the BitLicense regulations in 2015. In April 2018, when the New York Attorney General’s office sent out a voluntary questionnaire to 13 exchanges as part of a “fact-finding inquiry,” Kraken was among four who chose not to respond. “If you want to talk to us, ask us for a phone call, fly yourself out to San Francisco, invite us for lunch at your office,” Powell said in a later media interview. He recently hired CoinDesk’s founding editor Pete Rizzo as editor-at-large to drive content related to new products and services.

No. 41. Leon Li, Founder, Huobi Group

Leon Li was a computer engineer at Oracle before he went on to cofound Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange in Hong Kong 2013, and later received backing from well-connected ZhenFund and Sequoia China. After China tightened regulations on cryptocurrency activities, the company relocated its headquarters to the more crypto-friendly Singapore in 2017. Huobi Global now has offices in Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, and the U.S. It has since expanded into other upstream and downstream businesses in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In January, it launched a licensed brokerage platform for institutional and high-net-worth investors.

No. 42. Heath Tarbert, Chair, Commodity and Futures Trading Commission

Heath Tarbert (Photo: Harvard)

Crypto Dad Christopher Giancarlo’s successor at the helm of the CFTC seems to be bullish on cryptocurrency as well. CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert said in January that bringing digital assets under the purview of his agency would help “legitimize” them.

Tarbert agrees that bitcoin is a commodity and in October said that he believes ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is a commodity, too. And he has said he “absolutely” believes ether futures could trade sometime in 2020. Which doesn’t mean he’s scrimping on enforcement. In FY 2019, the agency’s enforcement division paid for 80% of the CFTC budget, it said in December.

No. 43: Justin Sun, CEO, Tron

Justin Sun (Photo: Tron)

Mega marketer Justin Sun’s Tron has enough detractors that it’s easy to question the wisdom of his recent joke to Peter McCormack that TRX is a “shitcoin”—albeit one superior to Ethereum, in his not-so-humble opinion. His decentralized, entertainment industry-focused blockchain and TRX token have had a good year, and with its recent purchase of streaming platform DLive on top of 2018’s much larger BitTorrent (with it’s Tron-based BTT token) is certainly gaining a lot of attention. So did his recent purchase of the once-mighty Poloniex exchange from Circle, which he initially denied.

Once the chief representative of Ripple in China, Sun has mastered the “be heard” part of marketing, although not it’s “be careful” warning. The biggest example of this was his famous-then-infamous charity purchase of lunch with Warren Buffet for nearly $4.6 million. Hyped to the stars, it crumbled at the last minute after angering Chinese authorities—for reasons that aren’t entirely clear—to the point where he had to cancel, claiming kidney stones. An abject apology on Weibo and a video stream show he was in San Francisco and not detained in China rounded out the debacle. While it recently came off, it was a far more subdued affair the Sun only publicized two weeks later.

No. 44. Jeremy Allaire, Co-founder, Chairman & CEO, Circle

Jeremy Allaire (Photo: C-Span)

Jeremy Allaire has not had a good year. Goldman Sachs-backed Circle shut down its flagship peer-to-peer global payments firm Circle Pay. In October, the Boston-based firm spun out Poloniex, the once-dominant (but now minor) crypto exchange it bought for $400 million in 2018 to an “Asian investor group” that turned out to include Tron’s Justin Sun. Then in December, Circle sold its over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading platform CircleTrade to Kraken. And in February, Circle Invest went to Voyager. Circle co-founder and co-CEO Sean Neville stepped down after the Poloniex sale, and its CFO and chief legal officer departed after Circle Trade. Now, the company is focused on growing its USDC stablecoin market. Allaire is still a big name, and he had a star turn before Congress this summer, appearing before the Senate Banking Committee about crypto regulation in the wake of Facebook’s Libra project. But how many more will he have?

No. 45. Roger Ver, Investor, Bitcoin Cash Evangelist, and CEO, Bitcoin.com

Roger Ver (Photo: RogerVer.com)

An early investor in bitcoin and bitcoin startups, Roger Ver has long been known as “Bitcoin Jesus” for his promotion of the virtual currency. His presence in the space goes way back. In June 2011, when a hack took early bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox offline for several days, Ver, who lives in Tokyo, along with now-Kraken CEO Jesse Powell were on the scene to help the company respond. The exchange later became insolvent. Where others might care only to acquire and expand, Ver brings a sense of contemplation to his moves, such as in 2018 when he split from (and beat) self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator Craig Wright in the middle of the BCH fork. He now promotes Bitcoin Cash. A libertarian at heart, Ver is also behind a project aimed at buying land and creating a free society.

No. 46. Nick Szabo

Current court cases aside—we’re looking at you, Craig Wright—Nick Szabo is considered among the most likely candidates to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto, or at least part of the group concealed behind that pseudonym. He came up with the idea of smart contracts in 1997. His “Bit Gold” proposal, which appears to have been published in 2005 or 2008 and possibly designed as early as 1998, contained most, if not all, of the features that ultimately went into Bitcoin. Although the solution to the double-spending problem ended up being different. Szabo has publicly denied being Satoshi Nakamoto, but even if that’s the case, his contributions to the creation of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology remain foundational. Szabo’s academic background is in both computer science and the law. His writings in recent years have focused on the evolution of collectibles which comprise non-fungible treasure and fungible money.

No. 47. Anthony Pompliano, Co-Founder & Partner, Morgan Creek Digital Assets

Anthony Pompliano (Photo: Medium)

Anthony Pompliano’s investment firm that focuses on blockchain technology and digital assets. MCDA is part of the much larger Morgan Creek Capital Management, which in 2018 purchased Pompliano’s previous company, Full Tilt Capital, an early-stage VC firm. As Full Tilt Capital’s Managing Partner, Pompliano had announced just before the tie-up with Morgan Creek that its next fund would invest entirely in cryptocurrency-related businesses.

With 300,000 Twitter followers and a host of speaking engagement, “Pomp” is a voice that’s hard to ignore. Pompliano also writes the daily “Off the Chain” newsletter on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology for institutional investors and hosts the “Off the Chain” podcast.

Before becoming an investor, Pompliano worked briefly at Facebook and Snapchat, and founded a tech company that he ultimately sold. He spent more than six years in the U.S. Army after university where he studied economics and sociology.

No. 48. Brendan Blumer, CEO, Block.One

Brendan Blumer (Photo: Wikipedia)

Brendan Blumer’s Block.one developed blockchain platform EOS.IO as a challenger to Ethereum. The company raised $4.1 billion in a year-long, record-breaking ICO from 2017-2018. There was a problem, though. Weak measures to block U.S. persons from participating in the coin offering failed, and the SEC ordered the company to pay a $24 million penalty for an unregistered ICO—widely considered one of the best settlement deals in crypto. Still, the EOS coin—the seventh-largest by market cap—saw its total market value soar to $11 billion at one point with Blumer owning 15% of Block.one.

Gaming is how Blumer got into crypto. While he was in high school, Blumer was selling swords, armor, shields, and other little assets of value inside games. When he was 15, he started Gamecliff, a company that sold avatars. That soon drew the attention of Brock Pierce who bought the company and relocated Blumer to Hong Kong. In 2016, Blumer met Dan Larimer and the pair started working on Block.one, which Pierce also got involved in. Despite its early promise, EOS is said to suffer from performance issues. Critics argue it isn’t a blockchain, just a glorified cloud computing service. And it is also at risk of centralization.

No. 49. Paolo Ardoino, CTO Tether & Bitfinex

Paolo Ardoino became a prominent feature in social media in May 2019 when he started defending Bitfinex against the New York Attorney General, who was suing the company for fraud. Since then Ardoino has become the de facto frontman of Bitfinex, a controversial British Virgin Islands-registered crypto exchange. Turns out Ardoino has been with the company since 2014, first as a software developer and, starting the following year, as its CTO working out of London. He is also the CTO of Bitfinex’s sister company Tether, which issues a stablecoin by the same name.

Paolo Ardoino (Photo: Tether)

Both Tether and Bitfinex have been surrounded in controversy over the last year. ever since the NYAG claimed the exchange was hiding the loss of $850 million from its customers, and borrowing hundreds of millions from funds that were thought to be backing tethers to fill the gap. Then there’s that whole thing about not having the fiat cache backing tether audited, and the $1.4 trillion class-action suit blaming it for the entire crypto winter.

Over the past few months, Bitfinex added Lightning deposits and transactions to the exchange and created a new gold-backed cryptocurrency, Tether Gold. Frontman Ardoino remains passionate about building things and evangelizing the future of the platform. While Tether’s stablecoin has its detractors, it is the main way bitcoin (and other) transactions are made on exchanges—in fact, it is more widely traded than BTC.

No. 50. Hester Peirce, Commissioner, Securities and Exchange Commission

Hester Peirce (Photo: SEC)

In publicly dissenting from the SEC’s refusal to overrule its staff and approve a proposal by Gemini-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss for a Bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded fund in mid-2018, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce suddenly found herself the darling of the cryptocurrency community. Dubbed “Crypto Mom” as a result, Peirce in her dissent wrote, “the Commission’s interpretation and application of the statutory standard sends a strong signal that innovation is unwelcome in our markets, a signal that may have effects far beyond the fate of bitcoin ETPs.” (Exchange-traded funds are a type of exchange-traded product, or ETP.) On Feb. 6, Peirce, known for her libertarian leanings, unveiled a proposal for a “safe harbor” under which cryptocurrency projects could launch ICOs with a three-year grace period free from SEC regulations. Her term expires on June 5.

No. 51. Adam Draper, Co-founder and managing director, Boost VC

Adam Draper (Photo: Boost VC)

Former Bitcoin maximalist Adam Draper wants to create an Iron Man suit, a real one, not like those found at the local Walgreens in October. After a brief foray on Wall Street and with some experience in entrepreneurship, Draper founded Boost VC in 2012 just a few years after graduating from UCLA. He has described its mission as investing in founders making science fiction a reality. Recent college grads don’t usually get to start VC funds. Venture capital investing is an apprenticeship business. New VCs learn how to invest well by observing more senior investors and absorbing lessons from them. They also learn from their own investing successes and failures. But coming from a family with three generations of venture capitalists before him including his father Tim (No. 26), Adam Draper was able to extend the family business to a fourth generation. Boost VC’s investments in startups include Coinbase, Ledger, and Polychain Capital. Its cryptocurrency investments include Bitcoin, Ether, Monero, and Zcash.

No. 52. Rahul Pathak, General Manager, Amazon Web Services Blockchain

Rahul Pathak is Jeff Bezos’ man in blockchain, and that alone means he’s someone to watch. Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) at Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides access to blockchain networks through both Ethereum and the Hyperledger Fabric. AMB was launched in April 2019, with participants including AT&T Business, Nestlé, and Accenture.

No. 53. Allen Day, Science Advocate, Google

Allen Day describes his role at Google as “customer zero” for the search giant’s cloud computing efforts. It’s his job to anticipate demand before a product even exists, and he thinks making the blockchain more accessible is the next big thing. Just as Google helped make the internet more usable 20 years ago, the tech giant’s next billions may come from pointing the spotlight on blockchains. If Day is successful, the world will know whether blockchain’s real usage is living up to its hype.

No. 54. David Treat, Senior MD & Global Blockchain Lead, Accenture

David Treat (Photo: US CoC)

Consulting firm Accenture has been very active in blockchain over the past several years, even getting a 2018 mention in Forbes as advertising the most blockchain-related job openings during the previous year. The company has gained the most traction in blockchain for financial services and has partnered with Crypto Dad’s Digital Dollar Foundation to advance an eventual U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency.

David Treat is a senior managing director and co-lead of Accenture’s Blockchain Business. He is also Accenture’s Lead for the New York Fintech Innovation Lab, a joint project between Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City. In addition, Treat is on the board of directors of the Linux Hyperledger project, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and several other industry organizations. He holds several blockchain-related patents.

No. 55. Linda Pawczuk, Principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP

Linda Pawczuk is a Principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP. She is Deloitte’s U.S. consulting blockchain leader and its global consulting blockchain co-Leader. She has spearheaded Deloitte’s global blockchain surveys over the past couple of years.

The Big Four accounting and consulting firm offers a full range of services, from corporate and consortium strategy to platform architecture and design, to use case design, build, and management. A November study found it listed more blockchain jobs than any other company.

Last year Deloitte introduced its mobile “Blockchain in a Box” demonstration platform in order to help clients understand blockchain’s capabilities and its current limitations. A platform like BIAB could be quite valuable in educating firms about how blockchain works and if it could be valuable in their businesses.

No. 56. Steve Davies, Global Blockchain Leader, PwC

A veteran of more than two decades at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Davies became the firm’s first global blockchain lead in 2017. PwC’s focus at this point remains on helping other companies—in many, many different industries—understand blockchain technology and figure out how it could work for them, before assisting with development and roll-out. This can be traditional companies looking for supply chain and trade finance issues, as well as newer companies looking to disrupt industries.

No. 57. Arun Ghosh, U.S. Blockchain Leader, KPMG

As head of Big Four firm KPMG’s blockchain practice, Ghosh oversees a full-service, strategy-to-implementation offering. KPMG has partnered with Microsoft on its blockchain businesses. Projects include an intercarrier settlement solution for telecom firms’ forthcoming 5G offerings. In a VentureBeat guest column, Ghosh advised scrapping a blockchain project if you can’t prove it “is useful and cost-effective in 12 weeks or less.”

No. 58. Paul Brody, Blockchain Lead, Ernst & Young

Ernst & Young (aka EY) is one of the largest accounting firms in the world, dubbed the “Big Four.” Last year, EY released into the public domain its still-under-development Nightfall hybrid public-private blockchain protocol, which the firm intends as a way to put private and secure transactions on public blockchains, in this case, Ethereum.

Nightfall was spearheaded by Paul Brody, a principal and the global innovation leader for blockchain technology at EY. Brody has previous experience in supply chain and the “internet of things,” both industries would greatly benefit from being able to record private transactions on public blockchains. Its EY OpsChain tokenizes assets and EY Blockchain Analyzer facilitates audits.

No. 59. Frank Xiong, Group VP Blockchain Development, Oracle

Speaking at a conference last year, Frank Xiong predicted that between “50% and 60% of companies will use blockchain in the next few years.” That is about what you would expect to hear from the VP of blockchain development at Oracle. The database and business software giant has been pushing hard into the space. It has created an entire blockchain platform with all the tools and building blocks for enterprises to build their own blockchain applications. At last count, the software maker has more than 100 customers using its blockchain platform to track items for purposes such as ensuring the Italian olive oil you’re buying was really made in Italy or that a manufacturer isn’t buying minerals that support armed conflicts.

No. 60. Rune Christensen, Founder & CEO, Maker Foundation

Rune Christensen (Photo: Twitter)

Decentralized finance is a big part of blockchain’s move into the mainstream, and MakerDAO and its DAI stablecoin is one of the biggest parts of DeFi—a term they invented. And Rune Christensen is at the heart of MakerDAO—both as CEO of the Maker Foundation, and by being the person who brings some kind of order to a decentralized system simply by being someone people listen to. The Foundation recently transferred its intellectual property to the newly created Dai Foundation, which it plans to dissolve in two years. Christensen’s name is conspicuously absent from the new foundation’s board.

The Ethereum-based decentralized lending platform works using the Dai stablecoin. Unlike other stablecoins, such as Tether and Facebook’s planned Libra, which are backed by fiat assets, Dai is backed by another cryptocurrency. As such, it relies on a complex system of smart contracts to keep the value of the coin stable. And while Christensen is CEO, the MakerDAO protocol is community-governed by holders of MKR tokens. In November, MakerDAO added the ability to use tokens other than ether (ETH) as collateral.

No. 61. Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director, Hyperledger

Brian Behlendorf (Photo: Hyperledger)

Who knew that the man behind SFRaves, the place to get info about what was going on in the rave scene in the 1990s, would still be killing it 28 years later? He was also an early participant in Burning Man. While it is fun to see different companies in blockchain duke it out for headlines, Behlendorf has spent the last 17 years at the LINUX foundation searching for common ground. Now he brings that to Hyperledger. The blockchain framework—particularly in its Fabric flavor, which reached a milestone with the release of version 2.0 at the end of January. Hyperledger Fabric has been adopted by major Cloud Service Providers including Alibaba, AWS, Azure, Baidu, Google, Huawei, IBM, Oracle, SAP, and Tencent. Other members include Accenture, American Express, JPMorgan, BBVA, Aetna, and FedEx.

No. 62. Rhomaios Ram, CEO, Fnality International

As CEO of the company that was formed to create the Utility Settlement Coin, or USC, Ram’s ambitions are huge: Create a fiat-backed digital token that will allow banks to settle transactions with each other without having to involve a third-party intermediary. It will provide instant liquidity by running international payments through central banks. Then again, its backers are huge. The current list includes: Banco Santander, Bank of New York Mellon, Barclays, CIBC, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, ING, KBC Group, Lloyds Banking Group, Mizuho Bank, MUFG Group, Nasdaq, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, State Street Bank & Trust, and UBS. Of course, it has to get the central banks to agree to participate, but the company says it believes it will sign at least one on this year to pilot the system. Plans are to release five flavors of USC coin to start—the U.S. dollar, pound sterling, euro, yen, and Canadian dollar.

No. 63. David Rutter, CEO, R3

David Rutter (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)

R3’s open-source Corda is not quite a blockchain, but rather built on the distributed ledger technology that underlies blockchain. Its cut-the-middleman cross-border payments platform was launched with great fanfare in 2017, supported by some top names in banking, but it’s been struggling.

However, a partnership with legacy payments processing middleman Swift—the company behind the slow and expensive messaging service that blockchain is supposed to cut out of cross-border payments—gives it a potential leg up. It also teamed up with Mastercard in September for a cross-border payments solution, but that’s to build a new one. And R3’s trade finance-focused Marco Polo Network recently completed a big test with ABN Amro and SBI Holdings banks. Other members include ING and Bank of America.

The Corda Enterprise platform has struggled with delays and, reportedly, discontent from its engineering ranks, and complaints that leadership had lost focus. Still, Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Service and Amazon Web Services’ Quantum Ledger database are working on development projects with Corda, as are Accenture and SAP.

No. 64. Umar Farooq, Head of Blockchain Initiatives, JPMorgan

Umar Farooq (Photo: Hyperledger)

Umar Farooq, JPMorgan’s head of blockchain initiatives, is also in charge of channels, analytics, and the treasury services department at the bank. Having been with JPMorgan since 2009, he has also held leadership positions in the fields of small business and business banking.

In his current role, Farooq supervised the launch of the JPMCoin, a stablecoin for instantaneous payments in early 2019. That was the first time a large U.S. bank created its own cryptocurrency. At the time of the announcement, Farooq told CNBC that “the applications are frankly quite endless; anything where you have a distributed ledger which involves corporations or institutions can use this.”

The public announcement was seen as something of an about-face for JPMorgan, whose CEO Jamie Dimon is known for his aggressively anti-crypto commentary—although he has spoken positively of blockchain. However, the JPM Coin is considered by most to not be a true “cryptocurrency” in the cypherpunk understanding of the term, as it is pegged to the U.S. dollar and will only be used for internal use by JPMorgan’s institutional clients.

JPMorgan has said it will use Quorum, its homegrown Ethereum-based platform to issue the coin. And recently, the bank has reportedly been in talks to merge Quorum with Ethereum venture studio ConsenSys to run its Interbank Information Network, with more than 300 members.

No. 65. Puneet Singhvi, Managing Director, Citigroup

Puneet Singhvi is managing director and head of financial markets infrastructure for Citi’s institutional client group. He also leads the company’s blockchain initiatives for the markets and securities services business working actively with FMIs, FinTech, and institutional clients on identifying and delivering solutions. Citigroup has been investing aggressively in the blockchain space, although last year it ditched plans for a Citicoin cryptocurrency that it had been working on since 2015.

No. 66. Ken Moore, EVP, Mastercard Labs

Ken Moore (Photo: Mastercard)

As the head of Mastercard Labs since August 2016, Ken Moore leads the firm’s research and development initiatives. That includes expanding the company’s portfolio with technologies such as blockchain, AI, and machine learning. Mastercard may have pulled its support of Facebook’s Libra project in late 2019, but the payments giant still maintains a strong foothold in the crypto world. It claims to hold the third-largest number of blockchain patents. And remains true to principals to expand financial inclusion with several public and private crypto initiatives, including a partnership with R3 focused on cross border transactions.

No. 67. Kevin Phalen, head of global business solutions, Visa

A former managing director for Bank of America, Phalen is now spearheading Visa’s push to expand its reach beyond credit card payments, where it is one of the dominant players worldwide. “We’re also going to be instrumental in breaking down geographic barriers that no longer need to exist in the B2B payment ecosystem,” he said in one interview. In mid-2019, the company launched a new network to help financial institutions process cross-border payments globally on behalf of corporate clients faster and at a lower operational cost. The Visa B2B Connect network initially covered 30 trade corridors globally and is built in part on Hyperledger Fabric. (Visa is notable for being one of the large payments companies that pulled out of Facebook’s Libra project in October 2019.)

No. 68. Jonathan Johnson, Interim CEO, Overstock.com

Jonathan Johnson (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)

After Patrick Byrne stepped down following bizarre admissions of a deep state conspiracy theory, long-time Overstock employee Johnson took over as the company’s CEO. He also retained his title of president of Medici. That wholly-owned subsidiary of Overstock wants to “change the world by advancing blockchain technology.”

Johnson has admitted he is a “hodler,” someone who holds onto Bitcoin as an investment, believing that someday cryptocurrency will be as common a form of payment as government-backed fiat currency is today.

No. 69. Charlie Lee, Creator, Litecoin; Managing Director, Litecoin Foundation

Ex-Google engineer Charlie Lee is the creator of Litecoin, often billed as “the silver to bitcoin’s gold” and the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation.

Charlie Lee (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)

He created Litecoin—currently the sixth largest coin by market capitalization, according to Messari’s Real Volume, in 2011 as a fork of the bitcoin code by tweaking a few variables and adding a different hashing algorithm. The altcoin rose to prominence only after getting listed on popular crypto trading platform Coinbase in May 2017.

This was while Lee was working at the exchange as its director of engineering. Despite stepping down from his post shortly after, he could not escape accusations of insider trading. Lee received even more criticism months later when he liquidated his entire LTC holdings at the top of the market in December 2017, claiming a “conflict of interest.”

No. 70. Katie Haun, Andreessen Horowitz General Partner

Katie Haun (Photo: a16z)

Katie Haun is a former federal prosecutor who led investigations into both Mt. Gox and Silk Road and created the government’s first cryptocurrency task force in 2015. She is the first female general partner at Andreesen Horowitz, also known as a16z, an influential venture capital firm headquartered in Silicon Valley with over $10 billion in assets under management. Haun is co-head of a16z’s $350 million crypto fund, one of the largest VC funds dedicated to cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

Last summer Andreesen Horowitz joined Facebook’s Libra digital currency project as a founding member with Haun a key part of the effort. Haun is on the board of directors of Coinbase and HackerOne and also teaches at Stanford University.

No. 71. Meltem Demirors, CSO, CoinShares

Meltem Demirors (Photo: Twitter)

Meltem Demirors, is currently chief strategy officer at crypto asset manager CoinShares, having previously worked for over two years as vice president at Digital Currency Group. Beyond her activity on crypto Twitter, where she has almost 100,000 followers, Demirors also co-hosted a podcast in 2019 on the crypto world—“What Grinds My Gears”—along with tech investor Jill Carlson. And of course, she is known as a crypto insider asked to define “shitcoin” by a congressman during a House Financial Services Committee.

In her role at CoinShares, which has over $1 billion in assets under management, Demirors is in charge of developing ways for institutional investors to gain access to the crypto market. Outside of her day job, Demirors has focused on the wider issue of bringing crypto to the masses through education by lecturing on blockchain at Oxford Saïd Business School and the MIT Media Lab, and is also a member of the World Economic Forum Blockchain Council.

No. 72. Mark Russinovich, CTO, Microsoft Azure

A Spanish-born American software engineer, Russinovich serves as CTO of Microsoft Azure. He believes that blockchain technology will become mainstream tech outside of crypto, and Microsoft is backing that. Last May, the tech giant announced the Azure Blockchain Service, a tool that helps developers and companies create, deploy, and manage blockchain networks. According to Russinovich, Microsoft’s own enterprise customers, such as Starbucks and Xiaomi, led to the development of the service as many were “overwhelmed” in developing their own blockchain platforms.

No. 73. Nouriel Roubini, Professor of Economics, New York University

Crypto’s Dutch uncle is an Iranian who speaks with an Italian accent. Nouriel Roubini, the NYU economics professor and head of Roubini Macro Associates, made his name (and earned the moniker “Dr. Doom”) predicting the severity of the 2007 financial crisis. He now has a new favorite target—cryptocurrencies. His public appearances and Twitter feed feature incessant attacks on the industry. Naturally, this has made him a popular speaker at crypto-related events.

No. 74. Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, CEO, Electric Coin Company

Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn is known in the crypto space as a cypherpunk and the designer of several decentralized systems. He is also one of the founders of Zcash, a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that is leading the use of zk-SNARKS.

Zooko Wilcok-O’Hearn (Photo: Wikipedia/Tobias Klenze)

That stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge” which tells the vast majority of us absolutely nothing. Basically, it’s a way of getting security while adding privacy to transactions. And it’s gaining a lot of advocates in the cryptocurrency developer space, notably Wilcox’s Electric Coin Company—the main Zcash development firm—and Tezos, which is adding ZK-SNARKS to its protocol. Zcash is notable because its privacy features can be turned on or off (they’re off by default).

Wilcox was caught up in some controversy in 2018 after he released information on just how much Zcash’s creators were earning from a rewards scheme that ends in October 2020. And last year, there was an uproar after Wilcox suggested allocating block rewards for this purpose. Because Zcash is decentralized that required a Zcash community vote, which succeeded earlier this year.

No. 75. Arthur Hayes, Co-Founder and CEO, BitMEX

Arthur Hayes (Photo: BitMEX)

Hayes has a taste for the good life. At the annual Consensus conference in midtown Manhattan in 2018, he pulled up in an orange Lamborghini to proudly display his success. As an equity trader at Deutsche Bank and Citigroup in the early 2000s, Hayes learned early on that the most profitable products a bank offers are derivatives because you never have to actually own the underlying asset.

Bullish and bearish, Hayes recently predicted that Bitcoin might rise as high as $20,000 in 2020, or drop as low as $3,000. But in the derivatives market, you make—or lose—money either way.

In 2014, working out of Hong Kong, he launched cryptocurrency exchange and derivative trading platform BitMEX with partners Ben Delo and Sam Reed. The Seychelles-registered company rakes in huge profits with a perpetual swap product that tracks a bitcoin-dollar index with a leverage of up to 100x. It doesn’t allow American traders though. U.S. citizens are banned to avoid a tangle with U.S. regulators.

No. 76. Christopher Giancarlo, Director, Digital Dollar Project

Chris Giancarlo (Photo: CFTC)

Crypto Dad didn’t turn his back on digital currencies after leaving his post as Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair for greener pastures, notably the white-shoe Manhattan law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Following up on the Oct. 15 Wall Street Journal editorial in which he called for the creation of a digital dollar, Giancarlo said, “We sent a man to the moon. We can send the dollar to cyberspace.” He doubled down on the central bank digital currency drive in January, announcing the creation of the Digital Dollar Project. It seeks to “catalyze a digital, tokenized U.S. currency that would coexist with other Federal Reserve liabilities and… meet the demands of the new digital world and a cheaper, faster and more inclusive global financial system,” he said. He also joined the advisory board of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a cryptocurrency industry lobbying group.

No. 77. Valerie Szczepanik, Senior Advisor for Digital Assets, SEC

The SEC still doesn’t seem any closer to approving a cryptocurrency ETF than it was in 2019. And its war on initial coin offerings, or ICOs, has picked up steam with a growing number of big lawsuits and settlements, such as Block.one (settlement) and Telegram and Kik (litigation war).

As the first “Crypto-Czar,” Szczepanik said her mission is “to facilitate capital formation, promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and protect investors, particularly Main Street investors,” in the announcement of her appointment when she took up the role. Most notably, the agency issued a few “no action” letters to small startups, giving examples of what it considers a cryptocurrency a utility token rather than a security. And while its long-awaited “plain English” guidance was widely panned as not saying anything new, baby steps are still steps. Its Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub), was created in an effort to create a place for FinTech.

No. 78, Tuur Demeester, Founding Partner, Adamant Capital

Tuur Demeester’s Adamant’s Fund 1 is described as a Bitcoin alpha fund whose goal is to “responsibly outperform Bitcoin in a tax-efficient manner.” In May, he tweeted that Bitcoin exchanges and custodians are “too big to bail”—meaning that they could fail because there is no lender of last resort. Prior to Adamant Capital, Demeester was editor in chief of Adamant Research, which focused on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Before starting firms named after an English New Wave singer, Demeester’s Macro Trends newsletter was among the first to add Bitcoin to its basket of recommended currencies in 2012.

No. 79. Tim McCourt, Managing Director & Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Products, CME Group

Sure it’s CEO isn’t married to a senator, but CME has been winning its fight with ICE’s Bakkt over the bitcoin futures market and, since Jan. 13, the options market. Tim McCourt is bullish on cryptocurrency as an investment product. And with the owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, among others, behind him, McCourt is one of the bigger names in the financial markets who are actually doing something in cryptocurrency investing.

Arianna Simpson is an early-stage investor backed by hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen of Cohen Private Ventures (twice) as well as other leading investors, including Union Square Ventures. She got another huge stamp of approval in February when she was appointed a deal investor by one of the most storied Silicon Valley VCs, Andreessen Horowitz. A veteran of Facebook and BitGo, and an alumnus of Y Combinator alum, Simpson is frequently sought out as a pundit by the media to comment on the state of blockchain and cryptocurrency investments.

No. 81. Silvio Micali, Founder, Algorand

The cryptocurrency space first learned about Micali in 2017, back when he started talking about Algorand, a new proof-of-stake blockchain protocol that its founder said would give Ethereum and Bitcoin a run for their money. The Italian-born, Turing-award winning cryptographer and MIT professor was late to bitcoin, but he grasped the concept immediately. After all, he had spent his entire career researching technologies that form the bedrock of blockchains today: public-key cryptosystems, digital signatures, pseudorandomness and multiparty computations.

Micali is also the co-inventor of a crypto method known as zero-knowledge proofs, which is gaining more and more favor in blockchain privacy circles. Zcash, for instance, uses a variant of the protocol to validate transactions without revealing which wallet a payment came from, where it was sent, or how much currency changed hands. As for Algorand, the project has raised $66 million from the likes of Union Square Ventures and Pillar. In mid-2019, it raised another $60 million in an initial coin offering out of Singapore. Its main offices, though, are in Boston.

No. 82. Michael Arrington, Partner, Arrington XRP Capital

A securities lawyer who was the editor of TechCrunch, Michael Arrington’s history with VC investing includes stakes in Uber, Airbnb, and Pinterest. In late 2017, he founded Arrington XRP. The $100 million fund chose XRP, the coin that powers Ripple’s RippleNet software, as its base denomination. Last year, Arrington XRP acquired ByteSize Capital, after raising an additional $30 million.

Whether or not Craig Wright is or is not actually Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, as he claims, he has done something many thought impossible: he united the cryptocurrency community. Against him.

He is also the father of Bitcoin Satoshi Version (BSV)—No. 5 by market cap, despite dismal volume—a cryptocurrency he says is faithful to “his” original vision of the first cryptocurrency.

Wright spends his days creating patents at nChain, except for when he’s tormenting the attorneys of Ira Kleiman, the brother of his late partner Dave Kleiman, who is suing Wright for half of the 1.1 million bitcoins the real Nakamoto mined, as well as half the intellectual property of Bitcoin. Which Kleiman assumes is Wright’s to lose.

Sharp and timely analysis, as well as a growing twitter presence, are building Selkis’ brand quickly.

No. 85. Mike Blandina, CEO, Bakkt

Mike Blandina (Photo: Bakkt)

New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, has jumped into the bitcoin futures and options markets in a big way with Bakkt. And while it has not been able to get the traction of CME Group, newly appointed CEO Mike Blandina is someone everyone is looking at. And it can’t hurt that he ascended to the top spot after Kelly Loeffler turned into Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler. There aren’t many higher places in which to have friends. The firm’s abortive attempt to buy eBay led to speculation that it would bring bitcoin payments into the firm, which had been a member of Facebook’s Libra before joining the October exodus. But it is still looking to get into payments in a move that includes acquiring loyalty program provider Bridge2 solutions.

No. 86. Jed McCaleb, Founder, Stellar & CTO, Interstellar

Jed McCaleb has a long history in the cryptocurrency industry, having co-founded Ripple before leaving to fork Ripple’s blockchain and create competitor Stellar. He is also the founder of Mt. Gox, but sold the early cryptocurrency exchange to Mark Karpeles long before it collapsed following a record-setting hack.

A lot of people were surprised when IBM selected Stellar’s lumen as the currency for its IBM World Wire payments settlement network. Both the independent Stellar Development Foundation and McCaleb’s firm Interstellar have a lot riding on the partnership, as Big Blue brings a strong record of making blockchain platforms work. It’s also one of the oldest and most storied names in technology, and banks tend to put a lot of faith in track records. But IBM’s Jesse Lund, who selected the lumen, has left the firm, leaving Stellar’s support in question.

And then there’s the big burn. In November, the foundation shocked (and pleased) lumen owners by announcing that it had destroyed 55 billion lumens—more than half the total supply of 105 billion and just shy of two-thirds of its own holding of 85 billion—deeming them unnecessary to the project. As an attempt to raise the price of the 14th-largest cryptocurrency, it failed dismally, as the foundation burned what was then $3.5 billion worth of lumens that led the holdings of other lumen-holders rising by a comparatively paltry $260 million. Then there’s the question of what it means that more than half of a payment network’s tokens weren’t necessary.

No. 89, 90, 91. Michael Gronager, CEO, Chainalysis; Dave Jevans, CEO, Ciphertrace; Dr. James Smith, CEO, Elliptic

Blockchain intelligence is becoming big business, and as law enforcement and intelligence agencies get more sophisticated about the ways blockchain and bitcoin transactions can be traced, big criminal cases will emerge—the shutdown of a major child pornography site, Welcome to Video, was a taste of what’s to come. That will have a number of effects, among them changing the perception that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are anonymous when they are actually pseudonymous. There are a number of firms operating in this field, but the leaders are Chainalysis, Ciphertrace, and Elliptic.

A former COO and co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, Chainalysis’ co-founder and CEO Michael Gronager’s firm made its bones on Mt. Gox, when co-founder James Levin told a congressional panel that his firm had located 650,000 bitcoins stolen from the failed exchange. The company has by the most contracts with the U.S. Government Coindesk reported, with agencies ranging from the FBI, DEA, and ICE to the SEC and IRS. The latter’s criminal investigations division chief publicly credited Chainalysis with assisting in the Welcome to Video investigation.

A self-described Cypherpunk with 17 patents in the cybersecurity field, CipherTrace’s Dave Jevans “went down the rabbit hole” with bitcoin in 2011 after working on blockchain predecessors such as e-gold. Before that, his first encryption company, Receipt.com, created the secure messaging tools used by Swift, through which nearly every cross-border bank payment passes. The firm’s focus is banks and exchanges, and more than 700 cryptocurrencies can be traced via its tools.

Elliptic co-founder and CEO Dr. James Smith, an alumnus of both Oxford and Cambridge, recently raised $23 million for the UK-based firm and is reportedly eyeing expansion into Asia. Elliptic’s focus is on helping banks understand their exposure to cryptocurrency, anti-money laundering software, forensics, and analysis and training. It recently told congress that cryptocurrency exchanges that take privacy coins like monero and zcash should be subject to stricter AML regulations.

Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency has now caught the attention of the U.S. Treasury Secretary and G7 finance ministers, leading central bankers, international regulatory bodies like the Financial Action task Force, and Fortune 50 companies. Now more than ever it is more important than ever that the industry have someone who can not only speak, educate, and lobby for it, but be spoken to when the powers that be have questions or demand answers. Boring is a blockchain policy advisor to the OECD and adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, where she teaches a class on fintech and blockchain. Starting out as a legislative analyst for the House of Representatives, Boring was a financial television program host before founding the CDC in 2014.

The controversial former child star of Disney’s “Mighty Ducks” fell into bitcoin in its early days, accumulating enough of it to make him a wealthy man. A serial crypto entrepreneur, he co-founded RealCoin in 2014, which was later renamed Tether. He also invested in Coinbase, Ethereum, and Block.one’s EOS, as well as Blockchain Capital. He was an EOS advisor up until John Oliver criticized him on “Last Week Tonight,” and the project kicked him off. In early 2018, Forbes pegged him at No. 9 in cryptocurrency wealth with holdings of about $1 billion—an amount he has pledged to give to charity. At the moment though, he is tied up trying to build a “crypto utopia” in Puerto Rico.

A poor showing in Iowa and New Hampshire primaries finally knocked Andrew Yang out of the Democratic presidential primary, but he was a serious presidential candidate that had cryptocurrency and blockchain proposal at the core of several planks on his platform. When Yang released his Crypto/Digital Asset Regulation and Consumer Protection platform in April—roughly two months before Facebook’s Libra proposal—he was one of the highest-profile U.S. politicians talking seriously about these issues. The proposal was a serious call for a legislative framework for digital assets that didn’t begin with “stop Facebook,” and the way his Modernize Voting policy would, well, modernize voting is by making it a blockchain-based mobile system. And he has gained enough of a following among the crypto faithful to retain his influence in this space longer than he ran his campaign.

Warren Buffett trashed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as worthless in a CNBC interview on Monday.

""Cryptocurrencies basically have no value,"" he said. ""You can't do anything with it except sell it to somebody else.""

The Berkshire Hathaway CEO remained a crypto critic despite dining with Tron CEO Justin Sun and other crypto bosses in January.

""The logical move from the introduction of bitcoin is to go short suitcases,"" Buffett joked, as criminals are laundering money online instead of stuffing cash into duffel bags.

Warren Buffett dismissed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as worthless in a CNBC interview on Monday.

""Cryptocurrencies basically have no value,"" Buffett said. ""They don't produce anything.""

""You can't do anything with it except sell it to somebody else,"" he added. ""But then that person's got the problem.""

The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO trashed cryptocurrencies despite hosting a belated charity dinner with Tron CEO Justin Sun and four other crypto bosses last month.

Sun said he gave Buffett a pair of Samsung Galaxy Fold smartphones loaded with a bitcoin and nearly $2 million worth of Tron's cryptocurrency. However, Buffett denied holding any cryptocurrencies in the CNBC interview.

""I don't own any cryptocurrency,"" he said. ""I never will.""

Shorting suitcases

Buffett told CNBC that none of Berkshire's businesses uses bitcoin, and highlighted its frequent usage for illicit purposes.

""Bitcoin has been used to move around a fair amount of money illegally,"" Buffett said. He joked that bitcoin's ""economic contribution"" to society might be reducing demand for suitcases.

""The logical move from the introduction of bitcoin is to go short suitcases,"" he quipped, as criminals increasingly move money online instead of stuffing cash into duffel bags.

Buffett may be a vocal critic of crypto, but he gave kudos to Sun for paying a record amount for their charity meal. The investor auctions off the chance to eat with him each year to raise money for Glide, a homeless charity in San Francisco.

""Justin gave $4.6 million to Glide and that will buy a lot of meals and provide a lot of beds for people in San Francisco,"" Buffett said. ""I thank him.""

NOW WATCH: A big-money investor in juggernauts like Facebook and Netflix breaks down the '3rd wave' firms that are leading the next round of tech disruption","The U.S. may soon get its first dedicated bank for digital assets.

A Wyoming corporation founded by blockchain legislative champion and Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long is preparing to apply for a special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter with the state’s division of banking. The future bank is called Avanti, which means “forward” in Italian, and will be focused solely on providing regulated services for digital assets, Long announced Monday.

The company, formed on Jan. 6, has already raised $1 million in seed funding. Avanti will provide payment, custody, securities and commodities activities for institutional customers using digital assets.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

While the company has yet to submit its application, it already has eight products in its pipeline that are not currently available in the U.S. market – the only named one being custody for security tokens. Because trust companies cannot custody securities under U.S. law, SPDIs are uniquely positioned to fill the gap.

Avanti’s balance sheet is planned to hold more assets under administration than deposits, and profits will be generated by providing services to institutional clients, similar to large traditional custody banks such as State Street, Bank of New York Mellon and Northern Trust. Long described the business as a “money warehouse.

The firm will custody digital assets without any change in the ownership of those assets, like a valet takes care of your car without being given its legal title, Long said.

Blockstream partnership

Under Wyoming state law, SPDI banks must keep all of customers’ fiat demand deposits as liquid assets and cannot lend. However, these entities get to operate under the regulatory oversight of the crypto-friendly Wyoming Division of Banking instead of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

Avanti is partnering with bitcoin and blockchain technology startup Blockstream, which will provide bitcoin applications, as well as the software and hardware needed to custody digital assets. “Blockstream brings software for the bitcoin protocol. … Avanti brings a regulated delivery vehicle to deliver it into the USD markets,” Long said in an email.

With Blockstream’s Liquid – a “sidechain” or parallel network sometimes used to move money between exchanges – the company will able to develop a “one-stop shop” for digital asset custody, said Blockstream CEO and cofounder Adam Back.

With Blockstream, Avanti can build adjacent blockchain application programming interfaces (APIs) and conventional banking APIs, Back said. The first might look like an API that initiates multi-signature transactions; the second is usually an API that transfers money between traditional banking ledgers.

Long, who pushed for the creation of the SPDI charter, said she didn’t plan on forming an SPDI bank until last Christmas when she was visiting Rome. Prior to her trip, a group – which Long would not name – approached her about creating such an entity.

Because of the high capital level required to start an SPDI – around $25 million – many potential applicants have been slow to seek approval, even though the regulatory door been open since last October. Currently, the Wyoming Division of Banking has only received two applications, which the regulator is working with applicants to refine.

In Rome, Long had been talking to Back on the phone when she became convinced to start Avanti. (Back is a well-known cryptographer who regularly talked with Satoshi Nakamato during bitcoin’s (BTC) early days and was cited in Nakamoto’s bitcoin white paper for having created Hashcash, a predecessor technology that inspired the first cryptocurrency.)

When in Rome

The setting was appropriate. While they spoke, Long walked between the Imperial Forums and the Roman Forums. There she saw for the first time a rostra, a large platform for delivering speeches. “A symbol of decentralized power where citizens gathered to debate and engage in commerce voluntarily during the Republic,” she said.

With Back, she talked about the need for big money – pension funds, endowments, foundations, corporations and sovereign wealth funds – to have a regulated partner to deliver services around bitcoin.

“It’s a $300 billion asset class and they can’t ignore it anymore,” Long said. “Their existing service providers aren’t able to help them.”

That night she landed on the name Avanti.

“It’s a fitting name for a bank that’s moving ahead, while also anchored in the history of sound money and clear property rights,” she said.

Seeking perfection

Having finalized the requirements for applications, the Wyoming Division of Banking is now developing the policies and procedures for SPDI banks and defining how the regulator will perform its yearly examination and supervision processes. To do this, the regulator is speaking to other state banking regulators to ensure the charter can transport to other states.

“Wyoming is integrating digital assets into the U.S. banking system for the first time,” said Chris Land, general counsel at the state’s banking division. “The first applications that go through the process literally have to be perfect because many of the top financial industry officials in the country will be following the process. Perfection, like art, takes time.”

With “a lot of trust placed in us by very important people,” Land said that the process will not be rushed. “Wyoming is a leader in responsible financial innovation, so we have to get this right,” he added.

The Wyoming legislature has several blockchain initiatives coming up later this year, including bills that would expand the blockchain task force into a select committee, provide First Amendment protections to code (as long as it isn’t written in a malicious way), and extend the SPDI charter’s field of service to include retail customers.","A New Jersey lawmaker wants to license crypto exchanges and custodians looking to conduct business in the Garden State.

Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez (D.-19) introduced the Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Act Friday, putting forth a proposal to license any entity looking to provide digital asset trading, storage, purchase, sales, exchange, borrowing/lending or issuance services. The N.J. Department of Banking and Insurance would be tasked with overseeing this license and regulating businesses.

The term “digital asset” encompasses virtual currencies, digital securities and other assets, including anything with a transaction history recorded on “a distributed, digital ledger or digital data structure in which consensus is achieved through a mathematically verifiable process.”

Under the terms of the proposed bill, individuals cannot conduct any business activity around digital assets unless they either have a license or have a reciprocal license in another state. Companies conducting business will also be required to make certain disclosures to customers.

The bill is framed as focusing on consumer protection, according to a press release.

“We must take steps to protect consumers looking to invest in cryptocurrency, while also allowing the sector to continue to develop and expand in New Jersey,” Lopez said in a statement.

She pointed to New York state’s capital expenditure requirements, saying many small crypto businesses fled to New Jersey as a result.

In her statement, Lopez said it was important to “establish fair and reasonable requirements” for these businesses.

Still, welcoming emerging industries will “keep our economy innovative and competitive,” she said.

Individuals who fail to secure the license or do not have a pending license application will be fined $500 per day, beginning when the regulator “issues a notice of failure” and extending until the individuals file their applications.","Luno, a global bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange, has announced it will be listing Ripple (XRP). The Luno exchange now supports BTC, ETH, BCH, and XRP.

Ripple uses a distributed consensus ledger. This works through a network of validating servers, rather than a blockchain as in other cryptocurrencies. This is the direct asset transfer bit. The transaction speeds are also faster. An XRP transaction confirmation takes an average of 5 seconds to complete – significantly faster than other cryptocurrencies or today’s traditional financial networks, which can take days.","The South Korean government is proposing a trading tax on cryptocurrencies, as part of its tax reform plan for 2020 due to be announced later this year.

The Korean Taxation Policy Association (KTPA), a consultancy body that advises the government, has proposed that profits earned from cryptocurrency trading should be subject to transfer income taxation.

This approach is in contrast to countries such as the United States, which view cryptocurrency as a form of property, and tax it accordingly.

The Korean Blockchain Association argued that current tax infrastructure is inadequate and that cryptocurrencies need more sophisticated legislation.""

South Korea is likely to introduce gradual tax levying from 2021, yet it's not clear whether this will be akin to a captial gains tax or will tax transactions.

The Korean Blockchain Association argued that current tax infrastructure is inadequate and that cryptocurrencies need more sophisticated legislation. In recent years South Korea has become recognised as one of the world's leading centre for blockchain development.

In a separate development, Forbes has reported that Korean technology giant Samsung could soon become one of the world's main drivers of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Samsung, which sells 19% of all smartphones worldwide, said in a statement: ""We created a secure processor dedicated to protecting your PIN, password, pattern, and Blockchain Private Key.""

""Combined with the Knox platform, security is infused into every part of your phone, from hardware to software. So private data stays private.""

2020-02-25,"A “short bitcoin” exchange-traded product (ETP), which inversely tracks the value of the top cryptocurrency by market cap, is now available to investors throughout Europe.

Swiss crypto product provider 21Shares, formerly known as Amun, said Tuesday its new “SBTC” tracker product would be available to both institutional and retail investors on Boerse Stuttgart, the second-largest stock exchange in Germany.

21Shares Managing Director Laurent Kssis told CoinDesk this would be the first inverse bitcoin tracker tradable in euros, making it accessible to a much wider variety of investors, retail and institutional, based across the European Union.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Most trackers are currently listed in U.S. dollars, which comes with “high hand grenade fees” for European traders, according to Kssis. The new Boerse Stuttgart listing means retail investors are no longer “lumbered with fees and some pretty wide FX rates” from their brokerages, he said.

Fully hedged against the underlying bitcoin (BTC) at a 1:1 ratio, 21Shares launched its SBTC tracker on the Swiss stock exchange (SIX) in January. The tracker moves inversely to the BTC spot price: Should the bitcoin price fall by $100, the SBTC tracker will increase by the corresponding amount.

21Shares CEO Hany Rashwan told CoinDesk at the time the product made bitcoin shorting simpler. Rather than taking out a capital loan or taking a risk on trying to sell at the right time, investors purchase SBTC as they do a stock without incurring interest payments.

SBTC positions reset at the end of each day, meaning performances do not roll over from one day to the next. Investors are liable to pay a management fee for every day they hold the tracker.

“The German market has been very vocal about being able to buy cryptocurrencies as well as going short and having some sort of protection,” explained Kssis. “For those who want to have some sort of protection, this is a great way to cover their long position.”

Listing on Boerse Stuttgart has “fast-tracked” the SBTC tracker, making it available for purchase on most Europe-based online brokerage platforms, Kssis said. He added that 21Shares has now filed a prospectus with the Swedish authorities to have it listed there, too.","Over 3.1 billion digital currency transactions were conducted across more than 20 different blockchain-based platforms during the past decade, according to a firm that monitors the Ethereum transaction mempool.

The research, carried out by San Francisco-headquartered Blocknative, a company that provides real-time updates on blockchain transactions, reveals that 24 major crypto networks have handled a combined $4.6 trillion in digital asset transactions from 2009 to 2019. Significantly, 96% of these transfers took place between 2017 to 2019.

The public blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) networks examined included: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), EOS, Tron (TRX), Stellar (XLM), Tether (USDT), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Monero (XMR), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Zcash (ZEC), Verge (XVG), Tezos (XTZ), Decred (DCR), Dash (DASH), Neo (NEO), Waves (WAVES), DigiByte (DGB), Bitcoin Gold (BTG) and GAS.

These particular DLT networks were selected because they have the largest transfer transaction counts, according to crypto data analytics site CoinMetrics.

Available data shows that there were 259.2 million Bitcoin transactions settled last year and 242.8 million transactions that took place on the Ethereum network during the same time period. There were a combined 1.1 billion transactions across all 24 networks (mentioned above) last year, the company revealed.

The team says that Bitcoin and Ethereum will most likely exceed the 1 billion transactions per year milestone by 2023. They’ve also predicted that the group of DLT-enabled networks may handle almost 20 billion transactions within the next five years.

Matt Cutler, CEO at Blocknative, noted:

“I recommend taking this forecast with a big grain of salt, as our future probably will not follow any linear growth projection.”

These figures are still quite small when compared to those achieved by traditional finance platforms. Visa, for instance, recorded $8.8 trillion in transaction volume during the past year.

Cutler remarked:","Crypto mining is one of the most important aspects of digital asset space. Knowing which crypto mining machines are the stars in 2020 can be useful.

The crypto industry is arguably the best invention in recent times. Mining cryptocurrencies, or as it is better known, crypto mining has emerged as a very profitable and efficient way to earn in the crypto space.

To succeed in crypto mining, you first need to understand how mining works and what it entails. This has, however, become quite an easy process due to the invention of what we know as mining machines. Today, all you need is a basic knowledge of the multi-layered and complex process of mining cryptocurrency and the aid of a good crypto mining machine to get started.

Before we move on, let’s answer the basic question that many of you probably are asking.

What is Crypto Mining?

Simply put, it is the process of solving blocks by making use of special equipment known as miners such as GPU (graphics processing unit), ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), or FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). Every time a block is solved, the miner receives a reward in the form of cryptocurrency.

Mining is one of the safest means of investing in the crypto space. So, instead of making a direct investment with your funds, you can make substantial earning by opting to mine cryptocurrencies.



List of top crypto mining machines in demand

Mining machines are quite different from one another and also vary due to their compatibility with other platforms. Let’s learn a little more about them through a quick overview.

CGMiner

This is one of the oldest and highly efficient Bitcoin miners available today. It has been around for quite a while and every update seems to make it better at mining Bitcoin.

Containing a lot of very important and useful features, it is an essential miner for beginners and experts.

As a cross-platform open-source crypto mining machine, it works incredibly well with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux alongside several other operating systems (OS). It is also compatible with FPGA and ASIC firmware, ensuring total monitoring at all times, remote control potentials, etc. However, it is important to note that CGMiner comes with a scalable network scheduler.

Claymore’s Dual Miner

Touted as one of the best crypto mining machines for altcoins, Claymore is what we refer to as a dual miner. Its unique functionality enables the mining of several algorithms at the same time.

The miner is based on the Dagger-Hashimoto (Ethash) algorithm and is compatible with AMD and NVIDIA for simultaneous mining. Users can mine as many as six different algorithms (Decred, Siacoin, Lbry, Pascal, Blake2s, and Keccak) all at once.

One complaint against Claymore has been that its mining program isn’t completely free. For every 36 seconds (for Ethereum mining) or 72 seconds (for dual mining) in one hour, there is a developer fee charged.

Claymore is also great for beginners as key points are usually color-accentuated, making it easy for beginners to notice them.

Other mining machines

EasyMiner

It has one of the most impressive graphical interfaces available and can be used to mine a wide variety of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to, Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Miners can choose from ASIC mining, regular mining, Cuda mining, CC mining, etc. EasyMiner is a great crypto mining machine to try out this year if you are using Windows devices. It is however not yet available for other OS.

MinerGate



MinerGate is one of the most effective combined cryptocurrency mining platforms available today. Supported cryptocurrencies on MinerGate include:

Bitcoin Gold (BTG)

Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum Classic (ETC)

Bytecoin (BCN)

Dashcoin (DSH)

Monero (XMR)

Zcash (ZEC)

Aeoncoin (AEON)

Fantomcoin (FCN)

MonetaVerde (MCN)

QuazarCoin (QCN).

The process is quite straightforward. First, you have to register on the MinerGate official website. Once registration is complete, you can then download the necessary program, set up and start mining right away.

MultiMiner

Its popularity is on the rise thanks to its convenient user interface. Miners can easily switch crypto mining devices (GPUs, ASICs, FPGAs) between coins (Bitcoin, Litecoin) with this program. It is perfect for beginners as it solves the stumbling block of having to look for the right altcoin to mine or leaning about mining pools. Making it even more user-friendly, you can install the MobileMiner app on your smartphone.

NiceHash

It is a multi-purpose program that mines crypto with video cards and processors. When you register on the NiceHash website, you gain access to the platform that enables mining with 30 different algorithms.

EthMiner

As the name suggests, the EthMiner is specially designed for Ethereum (ETH). It was created to help ETH GPU miners amass as much profit as possible from mining. Its configurations are quite similar to that of any other mining programs and can be downloaded on the GitHub website.

In conclusion

Many people see 2020 as the year when cryptocurrencies will make significant headways into the global market. One of the best ways to get involved is to earn crypto by mining.

Apart from making use of mining machines, you can mine crypto by other means as well.

They include:

Joining a mining pool

Making use of USB Miners

CPU mining etc.

The difference between mining and master node","The surge of Bitcoin (BTC) has fueled the expectations of a bright 2020 for traders and investors and has confirmed some of the predictions voiced by well-known cryptocurrency investors who anticipated this scenario in the closing days of 2019.

Analysing the most relevant crypto market latest news, we can’t avoid the announcement made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who indicated that new regulations were about to be rolled out to increase the transparency of cryptocurrency transactions.

Even though this news should have affected the most recent price surge to some extent, it seems that the markets are too caught up in a BTC-led rally that has also been followed by Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and other major cryptocurrencies.

Investors appear to be influenced by the upcoming BTC halving event of May 2020. The crypto market has been receiving inflows from traders fleeing from traditional securities that are widely exposed to the development of the coronavirus in China.

This surge in demand has fueled prices and may keep up its pace, driven by positive news from big financial institutions. For instance, JP Morgan is said to be planning the merger of its Quorum blockchain unit with a startup called ConsenSys. This would represent the sort of institutional support and be considered as an enormous vote of confidence from a big bank, which can push the digital currencies towards mainstream adoption.

Here’s a brief summary of how the market has behaved throughout February including a list of the most heavily traded and the most volatile cryptos.

Cryptocurrency market outlook February 2020

BTC/USD started the month at $9,300 preceded by a strong rise throughout January and by February 09 it was already touching the $10,000 mark.

XRP/USD also saw a significant increase in its market value during January, jumping from $0.19 to $0.24 and crossing the $0.30 mark only a few days ago.

The ETH/USD pair, on the other hand, started the month at nearly $181 and it is progressively moving closer to the $300s, while the LTC/USD pair has jumped from $70 to $81, following the market’s overall trend.

The top 5 most traded pairs as of now are BTC/USD, XRP/USD, ETH/USD, TRX/USD, and LTC/USD.

On the other hand, the 5 top risers for the month include STEEM/BTC, TRX/USD, TRX/BTC, BCH/USD, and BCH/BTC.

Most volatile cryptocurrencies in February 2020

Volatility in cryptocurrencies is measured by using a statistical metric known as the Standard Deviation (SD). This metric is calculated by looking at the fluctuation of the average value of the cryptocurrency during a certain number of hours, days, or weeks. The wider the fluctuation, the higher the volatility of the cryptoasset.

A volatile cryptocurrency is one with a value that may increase or decrease significantly farther than its average price and the higher the volatility of a crypto, the more uncertain its future performance is considered to be.

Some traders and investors profit from volatile cryptocurrency markets, looking to take advantage of directional movements such as the most recent surge in BTC values. Nevertheless, volatility can go both ways and a sudden surge may be followed by a sudden decline.

As of February, these 5 pairs have been the most volatile cryptocurrencies in the market.

Tron to Bitcoin – TRX/BTC

TRX is the basic unit of account for the TRON blockchain. This cryptocurrency is traded across all the major crypto exchanges, it has an estimated market capitalisation of $1 billion, and it is ranked as 12th largest cryptocurrency in the market. This cryptocurrency was launched in 2017 by Justin Sun and supports a decentralised open-source blockchain protocol.

The TRX/BTC pair indicates the value of TRX expressed in BTC and its value peaked at BTC 0.000023 after an early-February rally from its initial value of BTC 0.0000019. This surge was followed by a quick decline to BTC 0.0000021 and a subsequent increase that sent the value of this volatile crypto to BTC 0.0000025.

Steem to Bitcoin - STEEM/BTC

Steem is a social blockchain that powers a social-media-like community where publishers are rewarded for sharing content. Steem-based apps include Steemit, a social blogging platform; eSteem, a steem-based mobile app, and Dtube which is a decentralised video sharing platform. This cryptocurrency was introduced in 2016 by Ned Scott and Dan Larimer and it claims to have rewarded content creators with millions of dollars for sharing their ideas, pictures, and blogs through its platform.

The STEEM/BTC pair expresses the value of STEEM in BTCs and its volatility has spiked since early February when it was traded at nearly BTC 0.000170 and then increased suddenly to 0.0000264, a 55 per cent return in only 6 days.

Bitshares / Bitcoin - BTS/BTC

The Bitshares blockchain was introduced in 2015 by Dan Larimer using industrial-grade technology to assist organisations and individuals through a secure peer-to-peer distributed ledger that can also issue collateralised smart coins that track a financial benchmark such as the USD or a market index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500.

The BTS/BTC pair closes our list of volatile cryptocurrencies in February as its value has fluctuated significantly since January when it reached a bottom of BTC 0.0000019 to then start the month with a huge 78 per cent surge to reach BTC 0.0000034, continuing its growth throughout the month climbing to BTC 0.0000037 by February 14.

Speaking to CNBC reporter Becky Quick on Feb. 24, billionaire Buffett said that he does not own crypto and derided its supposed lack of purpose:

“I don’t own any cryptocurrency. I never will […] You can’t do anything with it except sell it to somebody else.”

However, on Feb. 25, Sun said in a tweet that he had gifted cryptocurrency to Buffett and that blockchain data proves that the billionaire did not move his gift of crypto assets:

“The cryptos $BTC/$TRX Mr. Buffett owns remain intact w/ #blockchain proof which is the beauty of blockchain.”

Sun also admitted that, while Buffett “owns” cryptocurrency, he would not define Buffett as a crypto investor. Sun added that the value of the Bitcoin (BTC) and Tron he gave Buffett has already increased by 20%.

Buffett ostensibly received the gift at his famous charity luncheon, which Sun won at auction last year. The two met at a private not-for-profit country club in Nebraska along with other crypto luminaries including Charlie Lee, founder of the Litecoin Foundation, and Chris Lee, the CFO of major cryptocurrency exchange Huobi.

Financial heavyweights criticize crypto for its illicit connections

Warren justified his lack of interest in cryptocurrencies by saying that they have no value and that “Bitcoin has been used to move around a fair amount of money illegally.” He is not the first member of the world’s financial elite to express distaste towards cryptocurrencies because of their purported prevalence in illicit activities.

For instance, in February 2018, Bill Gates stated that cryptocurrencies are “a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way,” referring to drug-related deaths.

Billionaire Mark Cuban, like Buffett, sees Bitcoin as having no value. He said at the end of September that he would “rather have bananas” than Bitcoin, because he can at least eat them.","Singapore’s Court of Appeals has ruled against digital currency exchange Quoine in a landmark case relating to a breach of contract when the platform unlawfully reversed seven trades.

The Straits Times reported the case marks the first of its kind in the country involving a cryptocurrency dispute. The ruling concludes a legal battle that began almost three years ago.

Quoine, the parent company of Japanese trading platform Liquid, now faces settlement proceedings after the court rejected its appeal over the claim it had the right to cancel orders placed by market maker B2C2 on its platform based on the premise those transactions were a “mistake.”

Quoine had argued the parties who interacted with B2C2’s trading software were acting under the false pretense the trades were at fair market value and B2C2 knew the trades were incorrectly priced.

In April 2017, B2C2 had placed seven trades in which it sold ether (ETH) at an exchange rate of 10 bitcoin (BTC) each, approximately 250 times higher than the market rate of about 0.04 BTC to 1 ETH at the time, according to court documents.

The appeal court’s reasoning focused on the question of how the legal doctrine of “mistake” should be applied when contracts were drawn up and executed by computer systems with limited human involvement.

A day after the trades took place, where 309 ETH were exchanged for 3,092 BTC ($12 million at the time), Quoine noticed the abnormality and reset B2C2’s balances to their state before the seven trades, which prompted the lawsuit.

The Singapore International Commercial Court ruled in March 2019 that Quoine was liable for the “breach of contract and breach of trust” in reversing B2C2’s trades. Subsequently, the exchange filed for an appeal.

However, four of the five judges presiding on the appeal panel dismissed Quione’s argument, saying it is the programmer’s state of knowledge that is relevant in the context of digital agreements between a computer system and a participant on the platform.","Crypto.com, blockchain payments and cryptocurrency platform, announced today the launch of the new onboarding platform for merchants to sign up for the Crypto.com Pay Checkout service.

To celebrate the launch of the platform, new merchants signing up for Crypto.com Pay Checkout will enjoy a settlement fee waiver for 6 months.

Through Crypto.com Pay Checkout, online merchants can offer their customers the option to pay with cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC and CRO using Crypto.com Pay, an online payment solution powered by the Crypto.com Chain.

Merchants now can accept cryptocurrency without worrying about price fluctuation, as payment amount in the fiat currency of their choice is guaranteed. No technical knowledge is required to integrate the Crypto.com Pay Checkout solution, all it takes is a few lines of codes added to the online store, and it is also available in the form of a simple e-commerce platform plug-in.","Blockchain infrastructure provider BitFury Group today launched its white-label Bitcoin wallet to enterprises looking for a one-stop cryptocurrency custodian and liquidity venue. Dubbed ‘Peach White-Label Wallet,’ the new product is a customizable mobile bitcoin wallet designed to be operated in-house by businesses looking to integrate bitcoin payments into their operations.

The B2B solution also enables crypto exchanges and token issuers to develop new revenue streams by offering turnkey custodial wallets as part of their services. Besides multi-layer security, other features include scalable infrastructure and 3rd party integration support from the Bitfury Peach team, which also offers a built-in merchant directory and end-to-end design and installation.

The wallet also has the potential to reinforce the security paradigm, and it can be linked to any crypto exchange platform or leveraged as a standalone app. Designed by Bitfury’s Peach payments engineering division, the new product is yet another key facet in the evolution of Bitfury’s crypto portfolio, which also provides a full package of mining services including a proprietary mix of hardware, software, installation, and operational services.

Bitfury sold its mining farm in Canada

Chris Dickson, Head of Blockchain Solutions at Bitfury, commented: “Our new white-label wallet makes it easier than ever for enterprises to accept bitcoin, which will spur consumer confidence and governmental support for digital currencies. Consumers want to use digital currencies in their everyday lives, and businesses that respond to this financial transformation will eclipse their competitors and usher in a new wave of digital commerce.”

Bitfury, which has offices in the United States and overseas, started out as a Bitcoin miner and has since expanded to become one of the largest private infrastructure providers in the blockchain ecosystem. Founded in 2011, the San Francisco-based group provides hardware and software around blockchain technology, including tools designed to investigate the crypto-based networks for suspicious activity.

In December 2019, Bitfury sold its joint crypto mining venture, which is one the largest farms in North America, to Hut 8 Mining Corp, a Canadian company involved in digital asset mining, for $7 million.",
2020-02-26,"The cryptocurrency markets were shaken Wednesday amid a flurry of selling that saw more than $190 million worth of longs and shorts liquidated on well-known derivatives exchange BitMEX.

According to data analytics provider Skew, around $6.1 million buy and $190 million sell liquidations occurred, bringing it to a total of around $196 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) long and short positions.

Beginning at around 14:00 UTC on Feb. 26, the price of BTC began to fall below $9,000. An hour later BitMEX saw its largest amount of liquidations since the new year began, rising well above $100 million.

Amid global coronavirus tensions, traditional markets are also in turmoil with major indices such as the S&P500 and Dow Jones Industrial down more than 7 percent on the week.

BTC’s latest price action continues to throw cold water on the notion that cryptocurrencies can act as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty around stocks and bonds with some of the largest levels of derivative volume ever witnessed.

“Bitcoin has been uncorrelated to other asset classes. If stocks drop, this does not mean bitcoin has to pump. If gold prices climb, this does not mean bitcoin will rise with it every time,” Coinist research analyst Luke Martin noted in a tweet.

In addition, options volumes on OKEx, another popular crypto derivatives exchange, saw the largest uptick of notional volume in its history, above the $15 million mark.

Notional volume is the value of the underlying asset in the derivatives market. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.

When there is a large amount of notional volume on a downward price, that generally signals the movement as a legitimately bearish one.","The Bull and Bear Case for Investing in the Top 20 Cryptocurrencies

Should you buy bitcoin or bitcoin cash? Does tezos have further room to grow? Is monero a long-term hold? There are no absolute answers to these questions and no crystal ball to determine which crypto will pull a 5x before the year’s out. Based on fundamentals alone, however, here are some reasons why you might wish to buy or sell the top 20 cryptos by market cap.

Also read: Bitcoin Rich: 6 Crypto Entrepreneurs Make the 2020 Hurun Billionaire List



Bitcoin

Bull: The bull case for investing in bitcoin core is pretty straightforward: it’s the largest crypto by a country mile with the deepest liquidity, institutional exposure, futures products, and store of value characteristics. It’s also got a halving that’s less than three months away. When the cryptocurrency market kicks into high gear, it’s a safe bet that bitcoin will lead the charge.

Bear: Bitcoin may be the safest haven for crypto investors, but it’s had 11 years for price discovery to play out. With a lack of innovation to renew interest and no major partnerships to announce thanks to its decentralized design, there’s a risk that investors could get bored and seek out more exotic assets. Moreover, with Lightning Network still failing to deliver, in the event of onchain fees rising to 2017 levels, the Bitcoin network could become unusable, diminishing its market value.

Ethereum

Bull: Ethereum 2.0 is on course to launch within the next four months. If the upgrade passes without a hitch, interest in the smart contract network is likely to surge. Its ability to shrug off all competitors to date, from EOS to Cardano, also stand it in good stead for the next bull run. Throw in Ethereum’s network effects, large developer community, and diverse use cases, and there’s a strong case for investing in ETH.

Bear: Ethereum 2.0 carries serious systemic risks, and failure to launch could impact investor confidence. A major defi hack is another black swan event that could surface at any time. ETH’s loose monetary policy is also a reason why it may be less attractive as a long-term investment, despite the network’s undoubted utility.

Bull: Remember what ripple did in 2017, rocketing from a few cents to over $3 a token? When market mania returns, a repeat feat is not beyond the realms of possibility. Ripple (the company) is also very well connected, and should it secure a major partnership, such as with a tech or payment giant, expect XRP to moon.

Bear: Huge Ripple holdings of XRP, little enterprise usage, and the specter of a securities lawsuit still linger over the third largest crypto by market cap.

Bitcoin Cash

Bull: Low onchain fees, significant innovation (e.g. privacy, micro-blogging), merchant adoption, and an enthusiastic community all augur well for the future of BCH. It does all of the things that BTC does, but without the risk of fees spiraling overnight. Some investors see BCH as a hedge against BTC underperforming; if bitcoin core fees rocket, expect bitcoin cash to prosper.

Bear: Much of the roadmap for Bitcoin Cash is based around securing global adoption as a medium of exchange (MoE). Should merchants and consumers trend towards using stablecoins instead of volatile cryptos, BCH could falter. There are also some community disputes over matters such as developer funding to be resolved. While not critical, there is an outside chance that acrimony could lead to factions.

Bitcoin SV

Bull: The machinations of BSV whales such as Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright, coupled with its limited liquidity which enables manipulation, means the Bitcoin fork could pump at any time. When it does, it’s likely to moon.

Bear: Holding a highly volatile crypto asset with limited adoption is a risky venture.

Litecoin

Bull: Litecoin often leads bitcoin in rallying, serving as the coal mine canary that presages a crypto market upturn.

Bear: As a generic MoE with little to distinguish it from BTC, a fundamental assessment of LTC identifies few attributes that qualify it as moon material.

Bull: EOS initially escaped the worst of this week’s market dump after its inflation rate was cut. The smart contract network has yet to deliver on its promises, but there remains wads of capital for EOS VC to award in grants, which could kick development up several notches. If EOS-powered social network Voice proves a success, there may also be an uptick in investment appeal.

Bear: The EOS network has been afflicted by degradation of service, while the wildly fluctuating cost of onchain resources such as vRAM can make dapps expensive to run at scale.

Binance Coin

Bull: Binance is the hardest working exchange in the industry, shipping new products at a dizzying rate. One of the best performing assets of the last 12 months, BNB’s fortunes are closely correlated with those of the world’s largest crypto exchange, which is showing no signs of slowing down.

Bear: Should Binance run into regulatory problems or suffer a devastating hack, expect BNB to plummet.

Tezos

Bull: One of this year’s best performing cryptos, XTZ could be viewed as undervalued when compared to similar assets such as ETH. Major crypto traders are long tezos, and have the social following to heighten the retail investor FOMO.

Bear: Tezos has yet to deliver significant utility, and there’s a distinct lack of notable projects that have launched on the smart contract blockchain. If Tezos doesn’t start adding real world value soon, XTZ’s goodwill could rapidly be exhausted.

Chainlink

Bull: Chainlink’s transformation from a small cap project into the cryptosphere’s de facto oracle solution, with a $500M market cap, has been impressive. Dozens of major partnerships, with the promise of many more to come, could keep LINK ticking over for months.

Bear: Critics assert that the LINK token has limited utility to justify its market cap, and that Chainlink could operate without it. Few entities are currently using LINK for anything other than speculation.

Cardano

Bull: A sleeping giant that has been slow to roll out its roadmap, Cardano has yet to realize its potential. If projects begin building on Charles Hoskinson’s Ethereum alternative, ADA could belatedly break out.

Bear: Like LINK, ADA isn’t being used for much aside from trading at present. At some stage, the network will have to start seeing usage, or there will be nothing to justify its valuation.

Monero

Bull: A privacy coin that actually works, and which sees respectable usage, particularly on the darknet. As the battle against privacy ramps up, monero stands out as a bastion of onchain anonymity.

Bear: A few thousand darknet buyers isn’t enough to send XMR’s price skywards. Furthermore, heightened regulatory pressure could see the privacy coin delisted from major exchanges.

Stellar

Bull: Fast, cheap transactions and the business nous of Ripple mastermind Jed McCaleb.

Bear: An XRP knock-off with a huge circulating supply and little to differentiate it from its more famous forebear.

Tron

Bull: Strong adoption by gambling dapps, tether, and the marketing clout of megamouth Justin Sun.

Bear: A relatively centralized Ethereum clone whose fortunes hinge largely on the actions of one man.

Huobi Token

Bull: The backing of one of the industry’s largest exchanges, with tentacles that reach around the globe, HT should grow with Huobi, particularly if initial exchange offerings undergo a renaissance.

Bear: Siloed within the Huobi ecosystem, HT’s fate is wholly dependent upon that of its issuer.

LEO

Bull: Bitfinex’s market share may have diminished, but the exchange remains a dominant force in the cryptosphere. The parent company of Tether is a shrewd operator with the experience and industry support to propel LEO to new highs.

Bear: Yet another exchange token with limited utility.

Ethereum Classic

Bull: If Ethereum 2.0 proves a flop, ETC could pick up the slack and enjoy a commensurate price jump.

Bear: Four years into its lifespan and Ethereum Classic has produced little to shout about. It’s hard to see that changing now.

In fact, the wider crypto market is now nearly completely in the red. This comes after weeks of bullish momentum. Moreover, traditional markets have fallen two days in a row as worries mount regarding the coronavirus’ continuing spread.

Flash Bitcoin crash obliterates recent crypto gains

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at below $8,700. This represents a massive intraday fall of over 7%. Furthermore, it breaks the bullish streak that Bitcoin has seen for the past few weeks. Although the price of Bitcoin is prone to fluctuate, this flash Bitcoin crash is likely too major to ignore.

As the following chart from COIN360 depicts, the cryptocurrency market as a whole is now blood red. This sudden crypto crash is currently obliterating recent market gains, and plunging back to levels seen in January. Ethereum and Ripple, for example, have both fallen roughly 10%.

Image Source: COIN360

However, it is unclear whether this market correction holds merit or is simply the result of an overreaction. For example, the stock market fell massively both yesterday and the day before.

The stock market has had its worst two days in recent history

In fact, analysts note that this is the “worst 2-day slide” for the stock market in four years. In total, the last two days have sunk the Dow by roughly 6.59%. Consequently, a Bitcoin crash of six to seven percent is – although major – in line with the traditional stock market’s performance.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin is often immune to the intraday fluctuations of the traditional stock market. The premier cryptocurrency, which many investors refer to as “digital gold”, is normally a safe haven for market fluctuations. In this case, however, it seems coronavirus (covid-19) fears have spread to the crypto market.

This is likely why the current flash Bitcoin crash is spooking investors. This, in turn, could cause them to pull out of the market “ahead” of the fall, which only exacerbates it. It will, therefore, be extremely interesting to watch the cryptocurrency market in the coming minutes and hours.

A golden buy-in opportunity or a warning of what’s to come?

If this market plunge is merely the result of an over-correction, it could provide a golden buy-in opportunity. However, if it is the beginning of a larger consolidation after the past months’ gains, it could get much worse.

One should keep in mind that crypto analysts largely agree that the upcoming Bitcoin halving will drive prices higher. However, analysts are sometimes wrong, and it is possible – although unlikely – the recent bullish signals were all wrong.

At the time of publishing, however, the price of Bitcoin is recovering somewhat from its low during the sudden crash. Bitcoin is now trading at $8,736 – representing an intraday loss of 6.37%.","Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya disagrees with Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett on the value of bitcoin, as Buffett declared earlier this week that cryptocurrencies have ""no value.""

""He is completely wrong and outdated on this point of view,"" Palihapitiya said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday.

Buffett thinks that cryptocurrencies ""don't produce anything"" and have zero value, declaring that he never will own anything like bitcoin. He's long been a critic of bitcoin and has described the digital currency as ""rat poison squared,"" a ""mirage,"" and ""not a currency.""

Although Palihapitiya disagrees with Buffett on the potential for cyrptocurrencies, the Silicon Valley investor said he still greatly respects Buffett on the whole.

""I think he's an exceptional person. I've learned an enormous amount, both from afar and the few interactions I've had with him,"" Palihapitiya said.","The US Securities and Exchange Commision has rejected New York based firm Wilshire Phoenix’s Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) application, citing ongoing concerns over market manipulation and a lack of surveillance-sharing agreements.

Commissioner Hester ‘Crypto Mom’ Peirce has publicly disagreed with the rejection.

NYSE Arca had submitted a proposed rule change to allow the listing and trade of Wilshire Phoenix's United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust. The proposal included both US Treasury Bonds and Bitcoin and hoped to address the SEC’s concerns over market manipulation by automatically rebalancing into bonds during periods of BTC price volatility.

Explaining the reasons behind its Wednesday ruling the SEC said the company had been unable to provide enough proof that it can protect itself from “fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” in the Bitcoin market in order “to protect investors and the public interest.”

The SEC noted:

“The Commission must disapprove a proposed rule change filed by a national securities exchange if it does not find that the proposed rule change is consistent with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act — including the requirement under Section 6(b)(5) that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”

The SEC has rejected at least nine previous Bitcoin ETF applications to date including applications from Bitwise Asset Management, VanEck/SolidX and Direxion. Kryptoin and Crescent Crypto still have crypto ETF proposals awaiting decisions from the SEC.

In her dissent to the rejection, Commissioner Peirce stated that the commission had “once again disapproved of a proposed rule change that would give American investors access to Bitcoin through a product listed and traded on a national securities exchange subject to the commission's regulatory framework.""","Coinbase Wallet Adds Support for Short and 'Human-Friendly' Cryptocurrency Addresses

One of the scariest features of transacting with cryptocurrency, for many new users, is correctly inputting the long hexadecimal addresses involved. Various individual projects and larger collaborations have tried to tackle this anxiety-inducing issue in different ways, so that bitcoin adoption can grow. The latest venture to try and take on this challenge is Coinbase.

Send Crypto Directly to @Username on Coinbase Wallet

San Francisco-based cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase has introduced a new way for its wallet app users to send each other crypto using short, human-friendly addresses. Every Coinbase Wallet user has an associated username (like @example), that can now serve as an address so they can easily receive transfers from other users of the app instead of their full-length crypto address.

This new feature is compatible with all the currencies already supported by Coinbase Wallet, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ethereum, ethereum classic, ripple’s XRP, stellar lumens, dogecoin, and all ERC20 tokens. For anyone with privacy concerns, the wallet app has been upgraded with a new privacy toggle in the settings menu so you can keep your username private and prevent other users from searching for it.

“Wallet users often tell us how cumbersome it is to deal with long and nonsensical crypto addresses like 0x89136a83664fa0673930be34463e444260775dc or 3GVBSgLLLjAoNRKxw5hm7kANN2P2mEQJy. They also tell us how stressful it is to send money with the fear of having copied and pasted addresses incorrectly,” explained Sid Coelho-Prabhu, Product Lead for Coinbase Wallet. “Human readable addresses help fix these problems.”

Ethereum Name Service With Multi-Currency Support

The Coinbase Wallet is also integrating the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which means users can now send crypto to .eth addresses. ENS supports not only payments of ETH but also BTC, BCH, LTC, and many others including all the currencies currently supported by Coinbase Wallet.

ENS is an open source project managed by a non-profit organization, supported mostly by grants from the Ethereum Foundation as it didn’t hold an ICO and has no investors. Its developers see it as a key component of the emerging decentralized web. Over 50 wallet teams have expressed support for integrating ENS into their apps.

The developers of the Coinbase Wallet app believe that these improvements will make cryptocurrency much easier to use and thus help drive adoption by a more mainstream audience. Coelho-Prabhu added: “There are now services that let you associate a short human readable name with your crypto addresses. We’re pleased to integrate them into the Coinbase Wallet experience. Users can now easily send money to friends and business partners like they do with traditional payment apps, albeit globally and in crypto.”

Saeed Muhammad, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ “Army of Guardians of the Islamic Revolution” (or Sepâh for short), a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, said in a speech Wednesday that Iran should look to cryptocurrencies to bolster international investment despite heavy sanctions on the nation, reported Coinit.ir.

“We are demanding the creation of a more sophisticated mechanism (a commodities exchange) to bypass sanctions,” he said. “To circumvent sanctions, we must develop solutions such as the exchange of products and the use of cryptocurrencies with our partnerships [in other countries].”

The news was first shared by Coinit.ir, a Farsi-language crypto news organization, on Telegram Wednesday. (Telegram is a popular app for sharing information in Iran, with Bloomberg describing it as “one of the most influential messaging platforms in the Middle East.”)

Iran has long been a target of U.S. sanctions, with leaders and other residents being placed under individual sanctions through the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control’s “Specially Designated Nationals” list. Sanctions are designed to isolate a nation from the global financial system, preventing international entities from investing in local projects or letting sanctioned nations easily trade with global partners.

The first sanctioned crypto addresses even belonged to Iranian nationals.

More recently, the Financial Action Task Force, the intergovernmental body that creates standards for combating financial crime worldwide, added Iran to its own blacklist due to alleged non-compliance with anti-terrorism financing requirements.

Iran has been laying the groundwork for a broader use of cryptocurrencies. The national government had previously been working with blockchain startups to update its financial infrastructure, with private banks backing some projects and the central government going so far as to provide funding for at least one company.

Speculation that Iran would formally try to evade sanctions using cryptocurrency has long been rampant, but at least one source told CoinDesk in February 2019 that it would be “too suspicious” for the central bank to actually go ahead with any project in that area.","Finland’s customs agency has been struggling with what to do with a horde of bitcoin (BTC) it fears could end up back in the hands of criminals if sold off.

Finnish Customs, known locally as Tulli, has been trying to offload a total of 1,666 bitcoin for several years, even drawing up a plan in September 2018 for a public auction of the digital coins. But officials have concerns that a sale would attract the wrong kind of attention and could even put the agency’s own security at risk.

Speaking to local media, Tulli Director Pekka Pylkkanen said: “From our point of view, the problems are specifically related to the risk of money laundering. The buyers of [cryptocurrency] rarely use them for normal endeavors.”

Tulli confiscated the bitcoin trove following a successful bust of an online dark market in September 2016. At the time, bitcoin traded at around $570, meaning the 1,666 BTC was worth approximately $950,000. With prices now just under $9,200, it’s worth closer to $15 million, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

At bitcoin’s all-time peak near $20,000 in December 2017, the cache would have been worth almost $33 million.

Tulli isn’t the only government authority having to decide what to do with confiscated bitcoin, usually with dollar-values many times greater than when they were first seized. The U.S. government, which has seized hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin over the years, has hosted multiple online auctions for confiscated bitcoin.

Bitcoin confiscated by the Belgian authorities was sold by an online auction house in early 2019. Later that year, U.K. police used the same auctioneer to sell more than $290,000 worth of cryptocurrency it had seized from a teenage hacker.

In 2018, the Finnish government barred customs officials from trying to sell seized bitcoin on exchanges or trading platforms, instead ordering the agency to hold any confiscated digital assets in a secure cold storage solution.","Cryptocurrency investor Michael Terpin can move forward with his case against mobile operator AT&T over claims the telecom was in part responsible for a SIM-swap hack that robbed him of holdings worth $24 million.

In August 2018, Terpin initiated the case against AT&T, alleging an employee, named as Jahmil Smith, had been bribed by a “criminal gang” to assist the fraud, which passed control of the investor’s SIM card to the hackers. Terpin alleged that while he was on the telecom’s hotline trying to regain access to his phone, his cryptocurrencies were stolen by the gang.

In the latest document from the case, filed on Monday, Judge Otis Wright II at the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California denied much of AT&T’s most recent motion to dismiss the case.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The court had found in July that while Terpin had sufficiently alleged that the hack was “reasonably foreseeable,” he had not shown proximate cause because he did “not connect how granting the hackers/fraudsters access to [his] phone number resulted in him losing $24 million.”

With the investor allowed leave to amend the complaint, Wright found Terpin has now sufficiently alleged proximate cause between AT&T’s conduct and the theft.

AT&T had also contended Terpin did not provide facts to support his claim that two-factor authentication (2FA) was involved in the crime because his cryptocurrency wallets may or may not have used 2FA – an extra level of security that sends a code to a related cellphone number to allow account access.

However, in denying the firm’s motion to dismiss, the judge said, “Mr. Terpin alleges sufficient facts for the Court to reasonably infer the hackers may have used 2FA methods to glean Mr. Terpin’s personal information from various accounts, such as email or cloud storage.”

AT&T had also attempted to have Terpin’s tort claims for financial losses thrown out by contending they are barred by economic loss doctrine, which sets out that parties entering a contract should be able to anticipate any potential losses resulting from a breach of the agreement.

However, if there is a “special relationship” between the parties, tort claims can be made if one party breaches the contract.

Judge Wright found that since Terpin was required to share personal information with AT&T “with the understanding that AT&T would adequately protect it,” he had sufficiently made a case for there being a special relationship.

On points where Judge Wright did not rule against AT&T in the motion, Terpin has been given 21 days to file an amended complaint to address any deficiencies.

Terpin is suing AT&T for $23.8 million in compensation, as well as $200 million in punitive damages.

In a press release on Tuesday, Terpin announced he will file a second amended complaint before the court’s deadline to support his request for punitive damages. He plans to demonstrate “how AT&T was both knowledgeable of, and responsible for, an ongoing sequence of cryptocurrency thefts due to SIM swaps dating back to well before Terpin’s hack,” the release states."
2020-02-27,"The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday that it had settled previously undisclosed charges against faded action movie actor Steven Seagal for failing to disclose that he was being paid as he promoted a cryptocurrency investment.

An SEC order said Seagal, who agreed to pay $314,000 in disgorgement and penalties in a settlement, violated anti-touting provisions of federal securities laws during the very brief amount of time he spent as ""brand ambassador"" for the ""Bitcoiin.""

The $157,000 that Seagal paid in disgorgement was approximately equivalent to the amount of money he was actually paid by the company.

The SEC said that Seagal, a 67-year-old martial arts expert who is currently residing in Moscow, Russia, ""failed to disclose he was promised $250,000 in cash and $750,000 worth of B2G tokens in exchange for his promotions"" for an initial coin offering conducted by Bitcoiin2Gen, a cryptocurrency system.

Those promotions included public social media account posts that urged people not to ""miss out"" on Bitcoiin2Gen's initial coin offering and ""a press release titled 'Zen Master Steven Seagal Has Become the Brand Ambassador of Bitcoiin2Gen,'"" the SEC said.

That Feb. 13, 2018, press release said, ""The inspiration of Bitcoiin2Gen is to make a superior or more advanced version of Original Bitcoin.""

Within days of the release, Seagal's Twitter account, which had about 107,000 followers, began posting messages about the company and its imminent initial coin offering.

""Don't miss out,"" a Feb. 28, 2018, message on the Twitter account said, which was echoed the following day with ""the same tout"" on Seagal's Facebook account, according to the SEC. The Facebook account had about 6.7 million followers.

The SEC said, ""These promotions came six months after the SEC's 2017 DAO Report warning that coins sold in ICOs may be securities.""

The agency also noted that under anti-touting provisions of federal securities laws, ""any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion.""

Chris Nassif, a spokesman for Seagal, said in an email that that the actor had been ""approached by certain individuals who said they were creating a digital currency and wanted him to be the 'brand ambassador.' ""

""Mr. Seagal, after consultation with others (including counsel), believed the product was a digital currency,"" Nassif said. ""He then agreed to allow his likeness to be used to promote the product. He allowed others to post certain items on his social media accounts regarding the product. At some point, Mr. Seagal became concerned with the bona fides of the product and terminated the relationship.""

""Mr. Seagal was not involved in the creation of this product, nor did he have any prior relationship with the individuals who approached him,"" the spokesman said. ""To him, it was simply a case of someone paying a celebrity for the use of his image to promote a product.""

Nassif noted that the SEC did not charge Seagal with fraudulent conduct. He also said the actor ""cooperated fully"" with the investigation ""and this matter is now behind him.""

""He looks forward to continuing his life's work as an actor, musician, martial artist and diplomat.""

Seagal's stint as a promoter for Bitcoiin2Gen was short-lived.

On March 7, 2018, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities issued a cease-and-desist order against BitCoiin2Gen, which said the firm is ""fraudulently offering unregistered securities in violation of the Securities Law.""

That order noted that Bitcoiin2Gen's press release about Seagal did not disclose the nature, scope or amount of compensation paid to Seagal for his promotion of the investment.

A press release issued by Bitcoiin2Gen just six weeks after Seagal's involvement in the company was announced said he was no longer serving as brand ambassador.","SEC Karate-Chops Steven Seagal Over Promoting Cryptocurrency Touted as the Next Gen Bitcoin

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged actor Steven Seagal for unlawfully promoting a cryptocurrency investment scheme claiming to be “the next generation of bitcoin.” Seagal failed to disclose that he was being compensated in cash and crypto by Bitcoiin2gen, or B2G, for marketing its token offering, such as on Twitter and Facebook.

SEC Charges Stevel Seagal for Unlawful Crypto Promotion

The SEC announced Thursday that it has settled charges against Hollywood actor and producer Steven Seagal over his promotion of a cryptocurrency investment product. The SEC explained that Seagal “touted on social media a security that was being offered and sold in an initial coin offering (ICO) without disclosing that the issuer was paying him for the promotions.” The offering was conducted by Bitcoiin2gen, also known as B2G. Noting that the actor violated the Securities Act, the Commission elaborated:

Seagal failed to disclose he was promised $250,000 in cash and $750,000 worth of B2G tokens in exchange for his promotions, which included posts on his public social media accounts encouraging the public not to ‘miss out’ on Bitcoiin2gen’s ICO and a press release titled ‘Zen Master Steven Seagal Has Become the Brand Ambassador of Bitcoiin2gen.’

“The SEC’s order finds that Seagal violated the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Seagal agreed to pay $157,000 in disgorgement, which represents his actual promotional payments, plus prejudgment interest, and a $157,000 penalty. In addition, Seagal agreed not to promote any securities, digital or otherwise, for three years,” the agency clarified.

Steven Seagal for ‘the Next Generation of Bitcoin’

Steven Seagal earned his net worth as a big action movie star of the 1980s and 90s. He appeared in more than 50 films, including Above the Law, Hard to Kill, Out for Justice, Under Siege, and Out of Reach. Seagal’s net worth is now $16 million, according to celebritynetworth.com. The 67-year-old currently lives in Moscow, Russia. President Vladimir Putin presented a Russian passport to him in 2016.

According to the SEC’s order, from about Feb. 12 to March 6, 2018, Seagal touted the B2G cryptocurrency investment opportunity on his Twitter and Facebook accounts. At the time, he had approximately 107,000 followers on Twitter and 6.7 million on Facebook. While he was not running the ICO, Seagal allowed his pictures to be used on Bitcoiin2gen’s official website and marketing materials. He additionally received payments for participating in a webinar with potential investments.

Bitcoiin2gen described its B2G tokens as “the next generation of bitcoin,” the SEC wrote. Its marketing materials say “Bitcoiin – 2nd Generation. Bigger and better than the original.” The company claimed that the funds raised would be used to “build an ‘ecosystem’ that would allow users to trade B2G tokens, provide wallet staking, and trade altcoins and fiat currencies, all ‘on a secure, comprehensive platform,'” the SEC described, noting:

Participants in the ICO invested bitcoin, U.S. dollars, euros, or made payments via credit card in exchange for B2G tokens.

The SEC further pointed out that Bitcoiin2gen’s press release included a quote from Seagal stating that he endorsed the token offering “wholeheartedly.” Noting that these promotions came six months after its DAO Report warning that cryptocurrencies sold in ICOs may be securities, the SEC emphasized that “in accordance with the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws, any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion.” Kristina Littman, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, clarified:

These investors were entitled to know about payments Seagal received or was promised to endorse this investment so they could decide whether he may be biased. Celebrities are not allowed to use their social media influence to tout securities without appropriately disclosing their compensation.

Bitcoin purchases on Cash App more than doubled over the last year, showing how rapidly the appetite for cryptocurrency is growing.

Bitcoin Drives Square’s Revenues Up

Square disclosed that the second most-used finance app on Google Play, Cash App, recorded $178 million in revenues from Bitcoin purchases during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company said in a letter to its shareholders.

The firm posted gross profits of over $3 million, representing a 50% increase from the previous two quarters.

BTC purchases on the Cash App rose by 240% since Q4 2018, according to data from Messari. During that time, only $52.4 million in revenue originated from its Bitcoin services.

Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square and Twitter, said that a Cash App redesign made it ideal for new users to discover Bitcoin.

“The peer-to-peer transfers network continues to be our best acquisition channel. Those new to the app then go on to discover Bitcoin and other in-app products,” said Dorsey.

Thanks to the user experience improvements, BTC purchases accounted for 47% of Cash App’s total revenue. Nonetheless, it only represents 2% of its gross profits due to thin margins and competitive exchange rates.

Now, the company is projecting between $705 and $715 million in “transaction-based costs and Bitcoin costs” for Q1 2020.

Square’s involvement in the cryptocurrency industry is growing at a fast rate. In fact, the firm recently announced that it is building a development kit to make it easier for developers to deploy their applicators on top of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.

Gartner analyst Avivah Litan believes that Square could position itself as one of the leading global Bitcoin payment processing companies now that it is penetrating some of the fastest-growing economies in Africa.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

The American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected yet another Bitcoin ETF application. This time, Wilshire Phoenix, a New York-based investment firm, bore the brunt of the agency’s ruling.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce believes the dismissal is unfounded and “evinces a stubborn stodginess in the face of innovation.”

SEC Sinks Another Bitcoin ETF

The Commission cited crypto’s vulnerabilities to market manipulation as a prime reason in its latest rejection.

Wilshire Phoenix, the applicant in question, submitted its proposal with NYSE Arca in June 2019. They refiled again in October so as to include a minor amendment, and the Commission postponed their ruling the following month.

On Wednesday, the SEC finally concluded that:

“The Commission concludes that NYSE Arca has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), and, in particular, the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be ‘designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and “to protect investors and the public interest.”

Wilshire Phoenix’s product now joins the Winklevoss twins, VanEck, and Bitwise in what is turning into a laundry list of rejected or withdrawn ETF attempts.

Following Wilshire’s rejection, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce voiced her disappointment in the agency’s resistance to this family of derivative assets.

She concluded that despite the responsiveness of each company and their accordant amendments, “this Commission is unwilling to approve the listing of any product that would provide access to the market for bitcoin.” She also cited the SEC’s application of a “heightened Standard under Exchange Act Section 6(b) to Rule Filings Related to Digital Assets.”

This section refers to the capacity by which an asset can be manipulated. According to Peirce, this condition should be applied to the exchange rather than the specific asset in question. It was for this specific reason that Bitwise’s application was rejected last October.

By including exposure to the highly-liquid and safe Treasury Bills (“T-Bills”) market, Wilshire’s product hoped to address this worry.

The United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust called the “Trust” for short, automatically rebalanced funds between BTC and T-Bills. The combination of the two would offer traditional investors less-volatile exposure to one of the best-performing assets this decade.

Wilshire Phoenix has yet to comment on the rejection, nor the firm’s next steps.","Over 1 million users of the Crypto.com App can now pay for bookings at over 2 million hotels and accommodations in 230 countries globally on Travala.com using the Crypto.com Pay feature in the app. From now until 30 June 2020, travellers can get up to 10% back in Pay Rewards for bookings paid in CRO .

","A U.S. court has found a former Microsoft software engineer guilty of embezzling millions of dollars and turning it into bitcoin (BTC) to fund a life of luxury.

Volodymyr Kvashuk, 25, was convicted Tuesday by the U.S. District Court in Seattle of 18 separate federal felonies that defrauded Microsoft out of a total of $10 million, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.

A Ukrainian citizen based in the town of Renton, Washington, Kvashuk worked full time for Microsoft from 2016 to 2018. Involved in developing and testing the company’s online retail sales platform, he used his account access to steal what is described as “currency stored value” including digital gift cards that he subsequently re-sold on the internet over a seven-month period.

Kvashuk built a lavish lifestyle using the embezzled funds, purchasing a $160,000 Tesla and a lakefront home worth an estimated $1.6 million. After uncovering the scheme, Microsoft confronted Kvashuk and fired him in June 2018.

Kvashuk, who claimed at trial to be working on a special project for the company, stole amounts totaling roughly $12,000 under his own account before using test email accounts associated with fellow Microsoft employees to begin embezzling millions of dollars from the company. Changing funds into bitcoin, he would use a mixing service to obfuscate its origins before transferring the ill-gotten gains into his bank account.

In total, bitcoin proceeds of over $2.8 million were transferred into his bank account. In tax returns filed during this period, Kvashuk claimed the funds were a gift from a relative.

The trial, which lasted five days, found the engineer guilty on five counts of wire fraud, six counts of money laundering, two counts of aggravated identity theft, two counts of filing false tax returns and one count each of mail fraud, bank card fraud and using a company computer for illicit purposes.

Speaking after the trial, special agent Ryan Korner from the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigations division highlighted that Kvashuk’s conviction was a result of work carried out by the IRS.

“Criminals who think they can avoid detection by using cryptocurrency and laundering through mixers are put on notice … you will be caught and you will be held accountable,” he said.","Two of the largest bitcoin mining equipment manufacturers are in a neck-and-neck race to roll out top-of-the-line machines ahead of bitcoin’s (BTC) halving event in less than three months.

On Thursday, Beijing-based mining giant Bitmain launched its latest AntMiner S19 and S19 Pro models, boasting computing power as high as 110 terahashes per second (TH/s) and an energy cost of 29.5 watts per terahash (W/T).

Going by the firm’s specifications, the two models would currently be the most profitable bitcoin mining devices if available, closely followed by the WhatsMiner M30S from Bitmain’s Shenzhen-based rival, MicroBT, according to a miner profitability index from f2pool.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The launch comes on the back of a heated battle between Bitmain and MicroBT, which has gained a significant share of the mining equipment business after selling about 600,000 units of its M20 series in 2019, chipping away at Bitmain’s long-time market dominance.

MicroBT, which launched its flagship M30 models in December, has started taking pre-orders for the latest and most powerful product line since last week, with deliveries of sample units starting as early as next month.

According to MicroBT’s major distributor Pangolin Miner, the M30S – priced at $2,430 apiece – touts a computing power of 86 TH/s with an energy cost of 38 W/T and uses 8-nanometer chips supplied by Samsung. The firm said some devices will ship from March to May, but large pre-orders would have to wait until as late as June.

On the other hand, prices and the pre-order/delivery dates for Bitmain’s S19 models have not yet been announced. Adding to the uncertainty is whether Bitmain can deliver production on a large scale, since the latest models adopt 7-nm chips that come in limited supplies from its vendor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

It also remains to be seen how the industry will react to the releases of top-notch but more expensive mining equipment, as bitcoin’s price has retracted from its recent growth momentum above $10,000.

Currently, Bitmain’s older model the AntMiner S9 is still one of the most widely used miners, generating a daily gross margin of about 30 percent at bitcoin’s current price, based on f2pool’s index.

Further, the coronavirus outbreak in China has affected the country’s manufacturing and logistics businesses, causing delays for those that were looking to expand or upgrade existing mining facilities.

In fact, data from mining pool BTC.com shows bitcoin’s mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards – has stagnated for a month and is currently around the same level seen on Jan. 28.","Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum. Source: a video screenshot, edited by Cryptonews.com

Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has no love for the stock-to-flow model when it comes to predicting the price of the world's most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC). But some believe this dislike has roots much closer to home.

Sharing two article titles on the possible effect of coronavirus outbreak on BTC price, Buterin commented that ""95%+ of articles of the form ""event X will make crypto go (up | down)"" are post-hoc rationalized bullshit.""

While the Bitcoin evangelist at Kraken, Pierre Rochard, thought that the stock-to-flow model may be a part of the other 5%, Buterin very much disagreed.

Nah that stuff is part of the 95% — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 27, 2020

Rochard also previously pointed out that the coronavirus is not a factor in the stock-to-flow model and should just be considered “noise” for bitcoin investors.

While Buterin certainly has his supporters, Blockstream’s CEO Adam Back, finds that Buterin's dislike of the model stems from Ethereum's own inadequacies. ""[Of course] you can't have a stock2flow when your altcoins stock is undefined and its flow is adjusted ad hoc on the whims of a few programmers,"" argues Back.

Well it's just a back tested curve fit to historic data, affirmed by co-integration stats test. What's not to believe? More interesting is interpreting why, given good fit. It does seem logical that rate of supply halving, other things being equal, would tend to drive up price. — Adam Back (@adam3us) February 27, 2020

Meanwhile, Buterin previously said that a lot of cryptos are committed to a capped issuance schedule and the ""idea that issuance is evil, and we must have a hard cap, and because a hard cap is the Austrian way, and we must take a strong stance that we are not like those hyperinflations fiat goldbugs.” As a reminder, Bitcoin's issuance is capped at almost 21 million, while Ethereum does not have a fixed supply.

The stock-to-flow model, created by anonymous analyst PlanB, measures the bitcoin price by using the number of BTC in circulation (stock) and the number of new BTC entering that circulation (flow). While some find it quite accurate, predicting a new high between 2021 and 2020, climbing to some USD 100,000 and accelerating, others are concerned by the growing stock-to-flow hype.

Source: Digitalik

Furthermore, hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor urged to ""forget about stock-to-flow,"" adding: ""Using stock-to-flow to predict prices is absolute nonsense. ""

PlanB and Back shortly commented on Trezor's post at the time.

There are a number tautologtical throwaway or flippant comments don't support the claim. Eg ""price depends on supply and demand"" yes, and what do you think happens if demand is constant and supply halves? That's the point! — Adam Back (@adam3us) February 21, 2020

Meanwhile, Ethereum found itself in some trouble as the opposition to its ProgPow upgrade is rising.

At pixel time (13:24 UTC), bitcoin trades at c. USD 8,848 and is down 4% in a day and 8% in a week. ETH is down 4% in a day and 9% in a week.

Navigate

The world is becoming easier to navigate, and people are increasingly traveling to parts that are not equipped to deal with tourism. Often travelers can be caught out in less developed countries with no access to ATMs and a shortage of reliable ways to pay for goods. The use of digital currencies and smartphones could become the best solution.

Imagine not having to search for the best exchange rates or having to carry the local fiat currency around in a wallet. This is freedom. Paying for goods and services on a mobile phone — and even a watch — has been an increasing phenomenon with services like Apple Pay and Google Pay on Android.

According to research, the amount of people who own mobile phones around the world is on the rise. Ownership levels in developing economies are highest in Vietnam, where 97% of adults own a mobile device, although about 90% or more also own one in Jordan, Tunisia, Colombia, Kenya, Lebanon and South Africa. Ownership is lowest in Venezuela, India and the Philippines, but even in these countries, about 70% of adults own a mobile device.

In the future, more hotels, restaurants and shops will be set up with crypto wallets on a smartphone or similar device to accept global payments in seconds — and this may happen in the developing world faster than the developed world.

Growing sector

The travel industry is one of the biggest industries in the world with around $1.7 trillion expected to be spent this year alone, making it the world’s second-fastest-growing industry. Now, crypto travel companies are making global crypto travel a reality.

As with all technology development, government and community help are paramount. The state government of Queensland in Australia is committed to technological innovation within the travel industry.

They have helped to make the Brisbane airport the first in the world to have 30 merchants accept cryptocurrency. In fact, Queensland is trailblazing crypto tourism with the regional town of Agnes Water, located at the southern end of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Here, travelers can find more than 40 businesses that accept crypto, allowing them to pay with Bitcoin for their accommodations, meals and even a day tour to the reef.

Additionally, travel giant Expedia is now back in the crypto game, having stepped out of it in 2018 when they stopped accepting Bitcoin payments directly through their platform. Now, they are offering cryptocurrency holders the ability to book their travels and holidays through the site and giving them access to thousands of hotels around the world.

Helping the unbanked

The figures speak for themselves. Globally, there are around 1.7 billion adults who are unbanked, mostly in developing countries like India, Egypt and parts of Africa. Without a fiat bank account, people from these countries can struggle to participate in the global economy. This affects many of the developing countries and their ability to trade in the world market. Crypto adoption can help change that.

It is important to understand that while it is still in the very early stages of adoption, crypto is much more than just a speculative asset, but it also has the ability to be used in the same way as any currency.

However, problems do exist. For example, many businesses that accept crypto for their services will charge users a high premium, which poses a barrier to adoption. This must be addressed and changed. Crypto must be usable, which is why it is important to provide incentives for early adopters.

Visa debit cards that convert crypto into fiat are becoming more common and are helping to grow the ecosystem. Allowing users to use cryptocurrency anywhere that accepts credit card payments will broaden adoption and take off.

Enticing users into the space with incentives will also help drive adoption, and as with credit card payments, more competition in the marketplace will help drive down fees. As crypto becomes more widely used, it will become more attractive to those who have never experimented with it and will lead more individuals to “give it a try.” This can only be a good thing for the wider crypto travel industry.

2020-02-28,"China’s relationship with Bitcoin has long been complicated.

Prior to the set of sweeping bans that the government place on the industry in late 2017, the country stood as the nation with the highest BTC trading volume in the world; since the bans–which shut down domestic cryptocurrency exchanges and ended domestic ICOs, among other things–the country has still played a crucial role on the Bitcoin network in the form of hash power.

“Hash power” is the amount of computing power that is needed to solve cryptographic equations on the Bitcoin network. These equations stand as the basis for Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism–software that securely adds and confirms transactions onto Bitcoin’s ledger. Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism model is known as “Proof of Work.”

The process of solving these equations and adding the transactions onto the ledger is called mining–it is executed by individuals and companies that have roomfuls of elaborate and expensive equipment entirely devoted to solving these equations. In exchange for the cost of energy and equipment that these “miners spend to set up their “rigs”, they receive “block rewards” in the form of Bitcoins.

BTC’s mining power is centralized in China–but is that really an issue?

It is a well-known fact that the majority of hash power on the Bitcoin network is produced in China, and has been for quite some time. In December 2019, CoinShares Research reported that indeed, as much as 65 percent of BTC’s hash power resides in China.

However, earlier this month, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s chief executive officer, made a rather controversial remark said CNN–one that seemed to imply that some force located within the country–either a conglomerate of miners or perhaps even the government itself–had strategically supported the building of the BTC mining industry in China so that the nation would somehow be in charge of Bitcoin’s blockchain.

“China… they really, through mining power control the Bitcoin blockchain,” Garlinghouse commented. “You have four miners in China that represent something like 60% plus of the mining capacity,” he continued.

Garlinghouse also mentioned that mining power on the Ethereum (ETH) network, which supports the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is centralized in China. “80 percent of the mining capacity is based in China for both Bitcoin and Ether.”

“So, in many ways, I think China has been incredibly strategic about how they think about that,” he said.

A number of critics fired back on Twitter, target Garlinghouse’s use of the word “miners” instead of the phrase “mining pools”, which may have been more accurate.

""4 miners control 60% of bitcoins mining capacity?"" I think you meant 4 mining pools??? Perhaps, this was just the slip of the tongue?! — Mati Greenspan (tweets are not trading advice) (@MatiGreenspan) February 17, 2020

Is there any truth to Garlinghouse’s claims? And even if China isn’t trying to take over Bitcoin and Ethereum, what risks does centralization pose to these networks?

Distribution of hash power is mainly between five entities, according to TokenAnalyst

According to recent research, it would seem that Garlinghouse is correct in his claims–at least about Bitcoin. The Bitcoin network’s hash power is centralized among several players in China is basically correct–although there isn’t much evidence to suggest that these mining entities are working together, or that the Chinese government is somehow using them to its advantage.

Indeed, research firm TokenAnalyst published a report in late January entitled “Centralisation in Bitcoin Mining: A Data-Driven Investigation”, in which it disclosed that “in 2020, bitcoin has also become a highly centralized system that places an increasing amount of trust in a small number of large entities.”

Specifically, this “small number of large entities” includes Antpool, Btc.com, Btc.top, F2pool, and Viabtc. According to Crunchbase, Antpool is based in China and owned by Bitmain, which is also based in China; BTC.com is headquartered in the Netherlands but is also “a part of” Bitmain. Btc.top is based in Shanghai, ViaBTC is based in Shenzhen, and F2Pool is based in Beijing.

All five of these companies operate under the umbrella of BitDeer, a company that sells customers hashrate out of each of the five pools. Tokenanalyst’s report said that as of “27th January 2020, these 5 mining entities controlled 49.9% of the hashrate of the bitcoin network.”

Interestingly, the report also noted that “BitDeer announced a partnership with chip manufacturer Bitmain…who, by agreeing to collaborate, have a powerful way to ensure their AntMiner line of products are used by a cabal of major mining pools at a time when they appeared to be struggling.”

“[Because of] the level of co-operation and trust required to operate this mining model between the mining pools, Bitmain and BitDeer blurs the line between distinct entities.” In other words, Bitmain may be playing a larger role in holding power over these mining entities than it may seem at first glance.

The source of Ethereum’s hash power, however, is a little less well-researched. However, there has been evidence to suggest that hash power on the network is quite centralized, but not necessarily that the majority of Ethereum’s mining power is produced in China.

Money, money, money

Why is so much of BTC’s hash power being produced in China? The answer may come down to nothing more than cost.

Suggested articles Top 6 Crypto Trading Tools You Should Use in 2021Go to article >>

Jake Yocom-Piatt, Co-Founder & Project Lead for cryptocurrency project Decred.org, told Finance Magnates that “the pattern has been that most miners are located in China because of economies of scale present within China and South East Asia.”

Indeed, Yocom-Piatt explained that this region of the world “is where most of the GPUs and ASICs in use are fabricated.” GPUs and ASICs are pieces of hardware that are integral to Bitcoin mining.

“Since both Bitcoin and Ethereum have pure Proof-of-Work consensus systems, they are subject to the indirect centralization that results from the fabrication process for GPUs and ASICs,” Yocom-Piatt explained. “Only a handful of facilities around the world can manufacture GPUs and ASICs, which drives centralization of the operation of the ICs being fabricated.”

Additionally, the country offers “low prices for electricity (often in remote locations), it is cheaper to build, maintain and staff facilities in China.”

CoinShares’ December report also found that specifically, Bitcoin miners in China’s Sichuan region are responsible for 54 percent of the network’s global hash rate. This may be due to Sichuan’s rainy season, which, through hydroelectric power generators, produces more energy than the region can use.

“Bitcoin mining companies are officially prohibited but are tolerated in the Sichuan province during the wet seasons when hydropower stations generate more electricity than is required, utilizing the excess energy thanks to East Asia’s plum rain,” a CoinTelegraph report explained. This becomes an issue during the dry season when miners take more than their share of electricity.

Is centralization a legitimate security concern?

But how much should Bitcoin users be concerned about the fact that so much of the network’s hash power is being produced in just one country?

There are, of course, geographical and geopolitical concerns: after all, reports emerged earlier this month that Chinese authorities have been shutting down Bitcoin mining farms to contain the spread of the Coronavirus.

Beyond that, though, over-centralization can lead to “51% Attacks”–which is to say that if a single entity or a coordinated group of entities have control of more than half of the hash power on a blockchain, they can use that hash power to erase and rewrite transactions on a blockchain, which can effectively destroy a network.

However, it doesn’t seem like the possibility of a 51% Attack by Chinese mining entities is on the horizon.

“This fact is not as alarming as people make it out to be, though, for the following reasons. A spokesperson from cryptocurrency education firm CryptoVantage told Finance Magnates that “China [itself] is not directly in control of all of those computers.”

“It is not the case that China has a harness or a method of driving these computers,” the spokesperson explained. “So the network is not under the threat of a 51% attack like many people like to think.”

Olga Feldmeier, chief executive of security token exchange firm Smart Valor, also commented during an interview with Finance Magnates in 2018 that she is not concerned about centralization on the Bitcoin network.

“To be honest, I used to be really worried about it–about two years ago, I was really checking the numbers to see which pool is connected to which pool and if they would ever reach 51 percent, [wondering] ‘will I lose all my Bitcoins?’”, she said.

“But the way the Bitcoin network functions, there are certain incentives in the system,” she said, explaining that it’s not in the best interest of mining pools to manipulate the Bitcoin network. “All those miners, at the end of the day, their business depends upon this network being alive and working.”

“If they collude, and kill it, there will be no future avenues and no future business for them.”

Is a change in consensus mechanism the only way out of centralization?

And while the alarm bells over-centralization may have been rung once again in recent months, there are a number of analysts who will argue that centralization has been a problem since the beginning of Bitcoin–and will remain an issue as long as Bitcoin has a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.

“Bitcoin is roughly as centralized now as it was years ago when I showed up to the space in early 2013,” Jake Yocom-Piatt commented. Today, “a few ASICs manufacturers make all the miners, several Chinese outfits dominate the network hash rate, and several developers dominate the core software development process,” just as they did seven years ago.

Yocom-Piatt believes that if anything, the network has become more centralized: “a notable change with centralization in Bitcoin is that there used to be a narrative that Proof-of-Work (PoW) had sovereignty in the network, and this has since been replaced with the narrative that only developers and full node operators have sovereignty.”

Therefore, he believes that “the only way to make mining fairer (and more decentralized) is to use Proof-of-Stake (PoS),” another kind of consensus mechanism that doesn’t rely on purchasing and running roomfuls of expensive equipment in order to confirm transactions and earn rewards.

However, Yocom-Piatt sees an issue with pure PoS mechanisms, too, a factor that led his own project, as well as the Ethereum network, to develop blended consensus mechanisms that use aspects of both PoW and PoS.

“The trouble with pure PoS consensus systems is that they reward people for doing very little and become an entitlement system,” he explained. “They also have stability issues because there is ‘nothing at stake’ when choosing a particular block to mine on. This is what led us to blend PoW and PoS in Decred.”

“PoW is meritocratic and irreversible,” he argued. “PoS is feudal and reversible. If you combine the two (PoW/PoS) you get a system that is part feudal, part meritocratic and irreversible. When PoW launches with Bitcoin, it was fairer than anything else out there, but that was quickly gamed. Now PoW is the least fair, followed by PoS, followed by hybrid PoW-PoS models.”

Called the “CoronaCoin,” its supply will diminish every two days based on the rate of new cases, according to its website - suggesting its price could move higher the more people the virus kills.

The coronavirus epidemic is becoming global, with six new countries reporting their first cases on Friday and the World Health Organization raising its global spread and impact alert to “very high.”

Latest WHO figures indicate more than 82,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries.

The rapid spread of the virus, which emerged in China in December, has stoked a frenzied selloff in global markets, with the three major U.S. stock indexes on track for their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.

Total supply for the CoronaCoin is based on the world population, and tokens will be burnt once every 48 hours based on the number of those that have been infected or have died, according to its website.

“Some people speculate a large portion of the supply will be burned due to the spread of the virus, so they invest,” Sunny Kemp, a user who identified himself as one of the developers, said in a chat on messaging app Telegram.

Kemp said the team comprised seven developers with more coming on board. He declined to identify others, but said they were located mostly in Europe.

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are digital currencies that rely on advanced cryptography to validate their transactions. The nascent asset class has been plagued by frequent price crashes and scams.

Transactions are recorded through a digital ledger called blockchain. The CoronaCoin blockchain documents the spread of the virus and the token can be bought and sold on some online exchanges, such as Saturn.Network, according to Kemp.

Around 20% of supply of supply will be allocated for donation monthly to the Red Cross using a well-known cryptocurrency payments processor, Kemp said.

Some users of social media platform Reddit users criticized the token.

“Frankly, this is amoral,” said one.

“Tasteless,” commented another.

“This is why we can’t have nice things,” wrote a third.

Asked whether the token could be seen as morbid, Kemp said: “There are currently active pandemic bonds issued by the WHO. How is that different?”","Australian Court Accepts Cryptocurrency Exchange Account as Security for Legal Costs

A court in Australia has agreed that a crypto exchange account can be used as security for potential legal expenses. Acknowledging the volatile nature of decentralized digital assets, the judge nevertheless conceded that cryptocurrency is a recognized form of investment in the current uncertain financial times.

$20,000 Worth of Crypto Allowed to Cover Legal Costs

Hearing a defamation claim, the New South Wales District Court was recently asked by the defendant to order the plaintiff to put $20,000 AUD (approx. $13,000 USD) into a court-controlled bank account, the Australian Associated Press reported Thursday. The money is supposed to cover some of the defendant’s expected legal costs if the plaintiff loses the case or decides to withdraw it altogether.

The court accepted the request allowing a cryptocurrency exchange account owned by the plaintiff to be used as security for the potential legal expenses, but a lawyer for the defendant remarked that although the account might be evaluated in Australian dollars, the digital money in it represented a highly unstable investment.

Judge Judith Gibson stated she was prepared to accept that cryptocurrency was volatile. “However, this is a recognized form of investment,” she pointed out in a judgment issued earlier this week. Trying to alleviate the expressed concerns regarding the assets, she also accepted the plaintiff’s undertaking to provide the defendant’s solicitor with monthly statements for the crypto account.

“I can see the desirability of the defendant receiving prompt notification of any drop in the value of the account. These are uncertain financial times,” Judge Gibson added. The plaintiff will be obliged to also alert the defendant’s lawyer if the account’s crypto balance falls below the equivalent of $20,000 AUD. The report notes that breaches of such undertakings can lead to the defaulting party being found in contempt of court.

Australia’s Proactive Regulatory Stance Creates Clarity for Crypto Companies

Compared to other developed nations around the world, Australia has advanced further in the efforts to regulate the crypto and blockchain space. Since 2017, cryptocurrencies similar to bitcoin in their main characteristics have been treated as property in the country and are subject to capital gains tax.

Austrac, the analysis center responsible for financial intelligence gathering and anti-money laundering policies, has been successfully working in that direction for almost two years. As news.Bitcoin.com reported this month, the regulator has already registered over 300 cryptocurrency exchanges. Global digital asset trading platforms have also demonstrated interest in the market. In January, U.S.-based exchange Kraken announced the acquisition of Bit Trade, Australia’s oldest operating exchange.

Besides trading, other related services such as crypto payments have also enjoyed growing popularity on the continent over the past few years, thanks to platforms like Travelbybit, Hula and the Bitcoin Cash Register. Retail spending reports published towards the end of last year showed that bitcoin cash (BCH) consistently captures the largest portion of these expenditures, with bitcoin core (BTC) and Binance coin (BNB) being among the other popular options. In early January, the leading global exchange donated $1 million in BNB to support the Australian bushfire relief efforts.

OKEx, which says it is based in Malta, has apparently suffered two attacks, one Thursday and one Friday, according to its CEO, Jay Hao. On his Weibo account Friday, Hao said the first attack was of a 200 gigabyte severity, but the second had doubled to 400 GB.

Despite the attacks, the exchange’s service is “largely unaffected,” he said. OKEx’s Twitter account has no warnings of interruptions this morning, apart from a brief interlude for a systems upgrade for its futures and options trading facility.

Apparently more severely affected is Bitfinex, which reported a suspected DDoS attack on Twitter Friday morning (UTC time).

The Hong Kong-headquartered platform’s trading services were offline for a period of under an hour, but at press time Bitfinex says services are back to normal.

Bitfinex Chief Technology Officer Paulo Ardoino told CoinDesk later that the “attacker tried to concurrently exploit several platform features to increase load in the infrastructure.”

“We use a variety of different prevention mechanisms to guard against such a Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. Still, the huge number of different IP addresses used and the sophisticated crafting of the requests towards our API v1 exploited an internal inefficiency in one of our non-core process queues,” Ardoino explained.

With the need to react quickly to avert an escalation in damage, the exchange took the decision to go into maintenance. The CTO said it was “not due to the inability of the platform to resist, rather it was a decision taken in order to quickly bring in the countermeasures and patch for all similar attacks.”

A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm the hosting servers of an online service, using a flood of fake traffic from multiple computers to disrupt normal activity. A severe attack can take a service offline, or may cause slow responses for website users.

It’s not clear why two major exchanges have been targeted in this way at roughly the same time, or what the attackers hope to gain.","The Takeaway:

Yemen, home to what the United Nations calls the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, is in a state of civil war.

Half of the country is controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi militant group, which has developed its own cryptocurrency.

People from Yemen are often wary of being associated with cryptocurrency, in part because of the Houthis’ crypto efforts.

Despite the potential advantages of a trans-national, censorship-resistant cryptocurrency in the country, connectivity issues make it very hard to get bitcoin into this war zone.

“It’s too soon for bitcoin,” one researcher said.

So far, it appears using bitcoin (BTC) in a war zone may be riskier than cash, especially when illicit actors use cryptocurrency as well as civilians.

The ongoing civil war in Yemen highlights the contradictions underlying bitcoin adoption: It’s difficult for civilians to acquire cryptocurrency without heavily regulated infrastructure that makes them vulnerable to coercion and surveillance. Such is the case in Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthi militia controls the northern half of the country and a failing government controls the central bank in the south.

For most people in Yemen, purchasing bitcoin is nearly impossible. Most international companies avoid doing business in Yemen due to concerns over U.S. sanctions, which aren’t comprehensive like the sanctions against Iran but nonetheless raise compliance questions. This week the United Nations Security Council approved further sanctions against Yemen in an attempt to curtail arms trading between Iran and the Houthis. With the Houthis now functionally governing the northern half of the country, the Trump administration may reportedly suspend humanitarian aid.

“Everyone’s looking at a timeline of a month or two. … That’s the point at which different [donors] will start to suspend some of the programs,” a senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters on Tuesday.

Story continues

Plus, peer-to-peer markets are hampered by both cash shortages and a lack of reliable communications infrastructure. Yemeni-American researcher Ibraham Qatabi at the Center for Constitutional Rights said telecom and electricity companies are owned by governments, both foreign and domestic, depending on the region. There’s no need for a warrant if Big Brother already owns the pipes. Plus, Qatabi said, most international money transfers are monitored by local authorities.

“Everything is monitored. They have everyone’s information,” Qatabi said. “If they want to go after somebody, they’ll have access to those files.”

Related: Bitcoin, Uncertainty and the Ultimate Narrative

Hamza Alshargabi, a doctor who worked in Yemen until 2012 and briefly mined ether (ETH) after he immigrated to the U.S., agreed it’s “almost impossible” to get a safe and reliable internet or phone connection in most of Yemen. He said in big cities connectivity is “so expensive that it’s unusable,” so he can’t imagine his sister using bitcoin in Yemen. Although someday mesh networks may help bitcoiners transact without reliable internet, there’s hardly any bitcoin to trade on the ground.

Meanwhile, it appears the Houthis are promoting cryptocurrency adoption, just not censorship-resistant bitcoin.

According to a report from the Yemen-focused Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies (SCSS) in December 2019 the Houthi militia instructed civilians in northern Yemen to trade in the internationally recognized bills for “an equivalent amount of e-Rials,” a cryptocurrency developed by the militant group.

As such, some Yemeni civilians and expats are scared to be associated with cryptocurrency, including bitcoin. If protests last year in Iran and Lebanon offered a peek at bitcoin’s limitations, then Yemen is the full picture of bitcoin usage still relying on government infrastructure.

Crypto wars

Cryptocurrency has itself become a weapon in Yemen’s civil war.

By issuing a digital currency, the Houthis strived to establish a circular economy with less dependence on banks hostile to their cause. The group even banned the possession of new Yemeni rial bills.

“They are denying the government the most basic function, printing money,” Alshargabi said. “At least in Iran there is a lot of wealth and oil, commerce they can build around. … In Yemen, there’s nothing to sell.”

This isn’t the Houthi’s first crypto venture. The group has been mining decentralized cryptocurrencies since 2017, according to the cybersecurity company Recorded Future, which declined to comment for this article. It is not clear which currencies the Houthis mined. However, some Iranian military leaders are looking to create cryptocurrency tools in order to circumnavigate sanctions. And, according to the Brookings Institute, “Iran’s influence with the Houthis is growing.”

Perhaps this is, in part, why the Houthis tested a payments pilot in April 2019, using the Houthi-run Yemen Petroleum Company and other public institutions, like the Yemeni Telecommunications Corporation. But the employees protested and refused to accept e-Rial salaries.

“Nine months on, the e-Rial can still only be used to pay limited expenses, such as water and electricity utility bills and mobile phone services,” the recent SCSS report noted. “There is currently no mechanism for using the e-Rial for normal daily economic activities.”

One SCSS researcher, who requested anonymity for safety, said the Houthis started these cryptocurrency experiments to deal with a local cash shortage. He added bitcoin may be caught in a paradigm where, socially, people mostly trust sources a friend or relative personally vouched for. Yet, talking about bitcoin on social media or local phone networks could get that person “targeted.”

(Note that all sources for this article commented from the Yemeni diaspora, due in part to what the SCSS researcher described as a “high level of scrutiny” through local telecommunications networks and “general concerns about monitoring financial activities in the area.”)

That’s why Alshargabi eventually stopped mining ether in the U.S., scared the American government would profile him for additional surveillance. Even if he has no connection to illicit crypto users in Yemen, Alshargabi isn’t confident the legal system would protect a foreign-born Muslim.

“How do I know I’m not going to get a knock on my door someday?” Alshargabi said.

So Alshargabi sends money to family in Yemen the old-fashioned way instead.

“You call your friend and say, ‘You give my mom $200 and I’ll give your mom over here $200.’ There are regular people in that type of business,” he said.

Dangerous public ledgers

This same ad hoc system Alshargabi uses to send his family cash also works for the few civilians in Yemen who want to own bitcoin, not e-Rials.

Since most global cryptocurrency exchanges don’t accept credit cards or bank transfers from Yemen, small groups of crypto-curious Yemenites show personal relationships across the diaspora are the key to accessing bitcoin in times of crisis.

Such was the case for a small group of roughly eight friends around 2018, including computer science student Manal Ghanem. She didn’t buy any herself, just played with simulations and testnets. But a few of her friends with family abroad got bitcoin by using foreign bank accounts on global exchanges. One bitcoiner would shop online for foreign products, then sell it locally for cash, she said, because shipping was the least difficult part of the cumbersome process.

“I do believe with the collapsing financial institutions in Yemen, if people get a bit educated they can leverage bitcoin to their benefit,” she said. “They are eager to create new opportunities but it can be really dangerous to go online and gamble what little you have and then lose.”

Her friend Faissal Alshaabi said he struggled to use exchanges in Yemen because his internet connection was too weak to even load a website. Alshaabi turned to a cloud mining service instead, but American regulators shut it down and he lost his capital.

Despite all these challenges, Alshaabi said he still believes cryptocurrency could be useful inside Yemen.

“It’s a fast way to send money and with low fees, so I think people would use it as payment method,” he said.

In the meantime, the most important thing Yemenites can do is establish situations where they can acquire bitcoin without attracting the wrong type of attention. This education requires in-person meetings. Governments may not be able to confiscate your bitcoin, but they can take your life.

“In terms of increasing awareness, that would have to be verbally transmitted,” the researcher said. “It’s too soon for bitcoin.”

This week I’ve discussed the value of cryptocurrency networks, hot and cold storage systems and why privacy matters to the crypto-space. Today I’m looking into high vs low time preference and what it means for crypto-enthusiasts. Why should Ethereum developers care about high and low time preferences?

Let’s find out!

Low vs high time preference

To fully understand which time preference might be more beneficial in the long term, I will look at an example of how both low and high time preference investors build their portfolios and distribute their money.

But first, let’s start with definitions. According to Wikipedia, from an economics perspective, time preference relates to the following:

“Time preference (or time discounting) is the current relative valuation placed on receiving a good at an earlier date compared with receiving it at a later date.”

Essentially, there is no absolute distinction that separates “high” and “low” time preferences. Only comparisons with other individuals. Someone with a high time preference is focused substantially on their current well-being relative to the average person. On the other hand, someone with a low time preference places more importance on their well-being in the further future.

What this means is the higher the time preference, the higher the discount placed on present returns.

Digging deeper

Investopedia adds the following rather interesting view:

“Liquidity preference theory posits that people prefer liquidity and must be induced to give it up. The rate of interest is intended to entice people to give up some liquidity. The longer that they are required to give it up, the higher the interest rate must be. Hence, interest rates on 10-year bonds, for example, are typically higher than on two-year bonds.”

Of course, due to excessive government spending worldwide, some government bonds are starting to show signs of weakening. Not only are 10-year bonds giving lower returns than 2-year bonds, but the return is also negative – or below zero. This means lenders are paying interest to borrowers (the government), which makes little sense. Plus, investing in a bond for two years should give you a lower return than investing in a bond for ten years. Otherwise, the interest rate system is inverted.

By looking at the broader economic spectrum, we can deduce that the world’s current time preference is set to high. People, in general, tend to use debt as an investment vehicle, as well as to increase their present consumption in detriment of future consumption.

Does this mentality also apply when investing into Ethereum and Bitcoin? If so, how?

Low time preference generations produce prosperity, which produces high time preference generations, who bring ruin, which produces low time preference generations.



Simolar to Glubb's The Fate of Empires & Search for Survival.

Aslo Ibn Khaldoun's Muqaddima https://t.co/cw3D7qlbqa — Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) July 26, 2018

In essence, low time preference investors will choose to allocate a higher percentage of their income stream – be it salary or capital gains – to assets that may have a higher value in the future. A low time preference investor will try to sacrifice present consumption for future consumption.

This definition explains why high time preference investors rely on debt to satisfy their present needs, instead of allocating smaller amounts of capital to multiple investments.

Low time preference Bitcoin investors will allocate money earned – not money created from debt – into Bitcoin. Usually, this allocation happens periodically, like a daily, weekly, or monthly allocation of a percentage of earnings.

Most likely, low time preference Bitcoin investors follow the dollar cost averaging strategy. It suggests investing the same (or similar) amount on a regular basis is more efficient and will yield higher returns than investing everything on a single transaction.

Smart Bitcoin investors will prefer to invest money they can afford to lose, instead of depending 100% on the results of the Bitcoin market.

In essence, we prefer to sacrifice present gains for future gains.

High time preference Bitcoin investors

High time preference behavior: Endorsing something you don't believe in.

Low time preference behavior: Telling the truth. — Jimmy Song (송재준) (@jimmysong) August 24, 2019

A high time preference Bitcoin investor will most likely rely on debt to satisfy their total investment needs.

High time preference usually sacrifices future gains in favour of high-risk short-term gains. These investors will place bigger chunks of money into an asset class in one go, resulting in more concentrated capital from fewer parties. The chances of the market blowing up increase exponentially and people are generally unprepared as they have fewer savings. Higher time preference means present consumption increases and is usually financed by debt.

Since debt is credit, what high time preference does is to shift the weight of paying, onto future generations.

A high time preference investor will most likely use credit – so money that is not his/hers – to purchase assets and bloat the price. Remember what happened in late 2017?

This means either the price of assets is constantly going up or, if there’s a minor drop, the fall can escalate quickly as people cash out their concentrated investments in fear of losing everything.

High time preference investors sacrifice future gains by investing with leverage (credit is a form of leverage). Whatever the result may be, the value of money usually decreases in an economy ruled by high time preference. Credit (or leverage) adds fake liquidity into the market, meaning present prices will eventually increase exponentially given the improbability of future value being higher than present prices.

Therefore, economies and investors lose future money because present money will always be more valuable.

This article is not financial advisement","U.S. stocks continue to reel over coronavirus-related fears, and investors are increasingly betting the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates to stabilize the economy and markets.

But whether those investors turn to bitcoin (BTC) as a crisis hedge remains to be seen.

Such action by the Fed could, in theory, help bitcoin prices since lower rates would likely reduce the appeal of income-yielding assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds, according to analysts tracking the 11-year-old cryptocurrency. So far, the Fed has not said whether it would cut rates, with Chair Jerome Powell taking a “wait and watch” attitude.

Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes slid by 0.15 percentage point to a new record low of 1.14 percent, indicating heightened demand; bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields. Rates also fell on government bonds from the U.K. Those from Germany and Japan fell further into negative territory.

“As interest rates decline, you’re more likely to tip the seesaw toward assets that don’t have yield, such as collectible assets like artwork or gold or bitcoin,” said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of Digital Asset Research, a New York-based cryptocurrency analysis firm.

Bitcoin prices are down 14 percent since Sunday, on track for their worst weekly performance since mid-November. The cryptocurrency slid 2.9 percent on Friday to $8,573, the lowest in a month.

Analysts and traders in the nascent market have debated whether bitcoin should trade as a hedge against malaise in traditional markets, or if it’s more vulnerable to a sell-off alongside riskier assets like stocks and emerging-market currencies when the global economic and market outlooks darken. Some investors say bitcoin is mostly uncorrelated with other asset categories, sometimes trading in sync with stocks and other times in opposition.

Bitcoin was launched by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto in early 2009, in the wake of the last financial crisis, so the cryptocurrency is largely untested in a market meltdown like the coronavirus-triggered panic selling now roiling stocks.

Haven Bet vs. Halving Bet

As a feature of the currency’s original design, the pace of new supplies of bitcoin issued to the decentralized network gets cut in half every four years. The next such event — known as the halving — is expected to take place in May.

That automatic supply tightening, encoded in the software, differentiates bitcoin sharply from human-led monetary-policy easing by central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve. The cryptocurrency’s price jumped 94 percent last year, roughly triple the gains in U.S. stocks; despite this week’s pullback, bitcoin is still up about 19 percent so far in 2020.

For now, the bitcoin market might be too immature for large investors with diversified asset portfolios to use as a hedge against a financial crisis. Indeed, bitcoin’s price drop in recent days — gold has slid, too — might signal most investors are still scrambling into cash when there’s a big market sell-off.

“We see a lot of these global actions having some impact on bitcoin, but there’s also things that are happening in the bitcoin network, and that could have a larger impact than the Fed cutting interest rates,” says Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund BitBull Capital in San Francisco. “I’m still bullish for bitcoin for the year, and a major reason is the halving.”

The Fed’s Next Move

The World Health Organization raised its risk assessment of the coronavirus to “very high” from “high,” with Italy now expected to approve emergency measures and quarantines and event cancellations reported in Germany and Switzerland, according to Bloomberg News. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has warned of possible school closings in the U.S.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is down 12.5 percent over the past seven days, putting the gauge on track for its worst weekly performance since the 2008 crisis.

That’s why investors are betting the Federal Reserve will make a move to help stanch the red ink. According to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures contracts used to bet on the Fed’s benchmark interest rate have shifted in the past two days to incorporate the near-certainty of a cut by the time of the central bank’s next regular monetary-policy meeting, scheduled for March 18. Just a week ago, most traders were expecting no change.

There’s also now a greater than 50 percent chance the Fed will cut rates by at least a full percentage point by December, from the current range of between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent.

U.S. stocks pared losses on Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a mid-day statement the central bank was “closely monitoring developments” related to the coronavirus “and their implications for the economic outlook.”

“We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy,” Powell said.

While rate cuts might ultimately prompt bigger allocations to bitcoin, investors in crypto and traditional markets could be so gripped right now by a crisis mentality that they’re indiscriminately selling all assets perceived as risky. Since cryptocurrencies are relatively new and their prices can be extremely volatile, bitcoin is still generally perceived as a risky asset, Cipolaro said.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) recently disclosed “Cryptocurrency Intelligence Program” (CIP) is deployed in every crypto-facing Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) case, says the agent whose unit built the tool.

In an email statement, Al Giangregorio – unit chief at the HSI’s National Bulk Cash Smuggling Center (BCSC) – shed a little light on the mysterious intel program first mentioned in ICE’s recent FY 2021 budget proposal. Without explaining exactly what CIP is or how it works, he said it helps HSI agents whenever cryptocurrency is involved.

“The CIP supports any HSI investigation involving virtual currency or blockchain technology,” Giangregorio said. “The program has assisted diverse investigations, including those involving methamphetamine and MDMA dealers, human trafficking, elder fraud, darknet market drug vendors, child sexual exploitation sites and, of course, trafficking in opioids.”

CIP was established by the BSCS, a Vermont-based outpost of the sprawling homeland security apparatus that slowly rose in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The 2001 PATRIOT act criminalized international cash smuggling; the financial crimes-focused BCSC helps ICE’s HSI agents track violators down.

Cryptocurrency was not an legitimate threat when BCSC incorporated in 2009. In the years since, though, crypto has grown into a more prominent criminal vehicle, prompting many federal law enforcement agencies to invest hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars into private-sector investigatory tools.

“Over time, the BCSC has recognized that transnational criminal organizations have evolved and diversified the way they transfer illicit proceeds,” he said.

The increasing shift to digital money also prompted HSI’s anti-cash smuggling experts to build the government the in-house program, according to Giangregorio.

“The BCSC established the CIP to adapt to changing methodologies and technology to target money laundering related to all types of criminal activity,” he added.

Taken in the context of ICE’s FY 2021 budget proposal, Giangregorio’s explanation gives something of a backstory to the otherwise unknown CIP.

The budget proposal described CIP as an unlicensed money services business identifier that crawls across illicit crypto-broker hotspots – peer-to-peer sites, darknet markets, classifieds – to gather intelligence.",
2020-02-29,"A year-long poll at a London-based crypto exchange is offering a unique look at the most popular cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Luno asked its three million users which coin they want to buy this year apart from the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.

Forbes reports that it grabbed a copy of the company’s leaked internal slides revealing the results of the survey. Flexing its muscle at number one is Ripple’s XRP.

“Other” took second place, followed by Litecoin (LTC) and Stellar (XLM), rounding out the top four spots on the list.

Grabbing the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth spots are Bitcoin Cash (BCH), the utility token Binance Coin (BNB), privacy coin Monero (XMR) and stablecoin USD Coin (USDC). Another privacy coin, Zcash, ranks ninth and ERC-20 token Maker (MKR) rounds out the list.

A number of large-cap cryptocurrencies did not make the cut, including EOS (EOS) and Tezos (XTZ).

Featured Image: Shutterstock/dwphotos","LINE, a Japan-based messaging service provider, has reportedly closed down its Singapore-headquartered crypto exchange BITBOX and has launched a globally accessible platform, BITFRONT.

Headquartered the US, BITFRONT is run by LVC USA, which is a subsidiary of LVC Corporation, a company that manages LINE’s digital asset and blockchain-focused initiatives. BITFRONT offers fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto trading options.

BITFRONT is part of LINE’s main business strategy, which involves offering global crypto exchange platforms. This, according to a representative of the firm that shared details about LINE’s expansion plans with The Block.

The representative noted that BITBOX has shut down after acquiring an operational license for offering crypto exchange services in US markets.

They added:

“[BITFRONT provides] extensive security and industry know-how built on LINE’s years of experience as a major global service. By linking other exchanges and order books, BITFRONT provides deep liquidity and ensures a tight bid-ask spread.”

The representative did not reveal which regulatory authority had awarded the license.

BITFRONT presently supports trading in five cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BTC), Tether (USDT), and LNK, which is LINE’s native digital token.

Youngsu Ko, CEO at LVC Corporation, stated:

“This is a major leap toward achieving the mass adoption of blockchain. We will continue to make blockchain and cryptocurrency more accessible to our users.”

LINE’s management revealed that the company has a global client base of 186 million monthly users.

BITFRONT’s services are not being offered to residents of New York, Hawaii and Nevada.

LVC Corporation is now managing two exchanges, which include global crypto trading platform BITFRONT and Japan-based exchange BITMAX (launched in 2018).","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

So far, the fast-growing decentralized finance sector has been mostly limited to dApps running on the Ethereum blockchain. Although DeFi Pulse doesn’t yet rank every single DeFi dApp in operation, a cursory glance at the leaderboard shows that ETH dApps dominate.

Only Bitcoin’s Lightning Network makes it into the top 21.

This dependency on Ethereum is among DeFi’s most significant vulnerabilities. The network is slow, and thanks to stablecoin transactions hogging the majority of bandwidth, prone to clogging. However, the challenge for DeFi developers working on other blockchains is that they don’t have the same user base and adoption that Ethereum can boast.

Enter Interoperability

Interoperability is the key to unlocking DeFi beyond the Ethereum blockchain.

DeFi dApps that can operate on multiple platforms offer the potential to create a thriving ecosystem across the entire blockchain space. It also means that developers can take advantage of the speed and flexibility of other blockchains while continuing to tap into the vibrant DeFi community.

Several interoperable protocols and dApps now exist, and we can expect more to come. But not all are necessarily trying to achieve the same thing.

This guide runs through the various types of interoperable DeFi dApps and how they’re helping to advance DeFi beyond the boundaries of Ethereum.

Please note that the classifications here are broad, and there are inevitably some crossovers.

Bridges

Bridges offer benefits to blockchain developers, as they enable dApps on one blockchain to tap into the features and projects of another.

Generally, they use some variant of a “burn-and-mint” mechanism where a token gets locked on one blockchain as it leaves and minted on the other when it enters. This mechanism keeps the token supply constant.

Bridges have risen in prominence this year, as both Syscoin and RSK have launched similar products.

Syscoin Bridge

Jag Sidhu, co-founder, and lead developer at Syscoin believes that bridges bring additional benefits particular to the DeFi space. He told Crypto Briefing in an interview:

“Bridges such as the Syscoin Bridge benefit DeFi by giving developers and users a way to participate in the global move towards sovereign value ownership, via decentralization. Without decentralization, DeFi faces skewed incentives and attack vectors, which render it another form of traditional finance.”

The Syscoin Bridge enables Ethereum developers to send their tokens to the Syscoin platform so they can benefit from far faster processing than is currently possible on Ethereum.

Syscoin is merge-mined with Bitcoin, meaning it is more decentralized than many of its peers.

Wanchain Bridge

Syscoin wasn’t the first to build its own bridge, though. At the end of 2018, interoperability project Wanchain launched a bridge between the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains using its own network as an intermediary.

Wanchain is also a member of Hyperledger, indicating that it could provide further bridge functionality in the future.

This would offer significant potential in the field of enterprise blockchain due to Hyperledger’s deployment in high-profile solutions such as IBM’s Food Trust and Tradelens solutions.

RSK Bridge

The most recent project to launch a bridge was RSK, the smart contract platform developed as a side chain from the Bitcoin blockchain. As a side chain, RSK could already send tokens back and forth to the Bitcoin blockchain.

The RSK bridge extends that functionality to the Ethereum blockchain, providing users with the ability to send tokens between dApps developed on the RSK blockchain to Ethereum.

Stablecoins, Lending, and Derivatives

There are several stablecoin and lending projects with interoperability across different blockchains.

Money on Chain

Money on Chain is the first use case of the RSK bridge outlined above. Money on Chain is a stablecoin project running on the RSK network.

Similar to Maker, it operates two tokens. The first is Dollar on Chain (DOC,) a stablecoin backed by Bitcoin and pegged 1:1 to the value of the US dollar. The second is BPRO, which absorbs the volatility from DOC.

Now that the RSK bridge is live, Money on Chain has access to Ethereum’s DeFi community. Parties can now use Dollar on Chain in the same way as Dai. Speaking to Crypto Briefing of the decision to develop Money on Chain on RSK, CEO Max Carjuzza told Crypto Briefing:

“Interoperability has been a cornerstone of the RSK vision from the beginning. We believe being able to offer Bitcoin’s benefits to Ethereum users and to connect these respective developer communities is a crucial step for the blockchain ecosystem and its future. Money on Chain allows the immense Ethereum DeFi ecosystem to integrate its two tokens and enjoy their utility.”

Kava

Kava is a cross-chain platform offering users collateralized loans and stablecoins across a variety of major cryptocurrencies. These include BTC, XRP, BNB, and ATOM.

Kava is the first DeFi dApp developed on the interoperable Cosmos network (see below), and as such, it’s generated significant buzz among the community, getting a boost from its IEO hosted on Binance.

With Kava, users can collateralize their holdings for the stablecoin of the Kava platform, USDX. Like Maker, Kava has a token providing governance participation and staking rights to holders. Kava also offers potential in the derivatives space, as it can scale to provide synthetics.

PEG Network

The PEG Network enables users to mint stablecoins using any asset as collateral. For utility tokens, this means a developer could give users access to their dApp without expecting them to bear the risks of volatility.

The first token to be minted on the PEG Network is USDB, which is a stable token-based on Bancor’s BNT token, hence the interoperability as BNT works on both EOS and Ethereum. PEG is still a relatively new project. The website states, however, that it plans to integrate more blockchains in the future.

XAR Network

Interestingly, XAR Network isn’t just targeting individual users, which have so far formed the user base for Ethereum’s DeFi.

It’s also targeting enterprises, including central banks and governments that may want to use its infrastructure to issue digital currencies. To that end, XAR Network offers both a public blockchain and permissioned, customized chains.

XAR Network’s public chain allows you to deposit any supported digital asset, collateralize it, mint Collateralized Stable Currency Tokens (CSCTs) based on this collateral, and then use these CSCTs to stake and earn rewards.

Greg Van der Spuy, CEO of XAR Network told Crypto Briefing:

“Basically, we designed XAR Network as a system that functions as the framework for decentralized finance – so interoperability is paramount. We specifically designed the DeFi infrastructure for a wide variety of uses and tokens. Our goal is not to make users exclusively use our tokens, but to enable others to build on top of our network and create their own tokens. In addition, we wanted to design a system that could provide institutions with the benefits of distributed ledger technology without them having to move their entire system to blockchain.”

Liquidity Protocols and Token Exchange Services

Uniswap is the go-to liquidity protocol of choice within the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling users to swap between any ERC-20 tokens.

The underlying smart contracts serve as automated market makers, meaning users rarely have to worry about low liquidity for any given token.

Bancor

Bancor is Uniswap’s nearest interoperable comparator. The project uses its own blockchain and native BNT token as an intermediary for token swaps.

When Bancor completed its ICO in 2017, which was the biggest in history at that time, Emin Gün Sirer of Cornell University wrote a scathing critique of Bancor, positing that the project didn’t need its own token. However, Bancor appears to have vindicated that decision when it went live on the EOS blockchain in 2018.

Despite being among the first to introduce interoperability, Bancor has struggled to gain the same traction as Uniswap, which shows around four times the volume. However, if DeFi successfully spreads beyond Ethereum to EOS, this could change, given that Uniswap currently has no interoperability.

Thorchain

Thorchain is currently still in testing on the Binance chain. It currently allows swaps, stakes, and withdrawals. It uses a similar model to Uniswap and Bancor, based on liquidity pools and its own RUNE token as a medium of exchange.

Thorchain has already laid out its roadmap for achieving full interoperability across the Binance, Ethereum, and Bitcoin blockchains, with the latter still in “scoping” mode. If Thorchain can achieve this, it would be the first DEX to enable swaps across three blockchains, including Bitcoin.

The lead researcher from the Thorchain team explained the project’s vision in achieving interoperability, particularly with Bitcoin. They told Crypto Briefing:

“The holy grail of cryptocurrency liquidity is the Bitcoin/USD pair. This pair commands a Pareto share of the market and services the plethora of derivatives available for Bitcoin. DeFi liquidity is not just about Ethereum, and it’s tokens – the real party will start when fully-collateralized, auditable, non-custodial exchange platforms appear, and they will be servicing the Bitcoin/USD pair first and foremost.”

Switcheo

Switcheo is a DEX offering swaps across a different combination of three blockchains including Ethereum, EOS, and NEO. In contrast to the others listed above, Switcheo relies on a more traditional trading apparatus, which Switcheo manages off-chain.

Like many centralized exchanges, it also offers users an exchange token giving access to trading fee discounts and other “membership”-style benefits.

Kyber Network

Kyber Network is familiar to those in the DeFi space as an Ethereum-based liquidity protocol. However, the team at Kyber has also implemented their swap protocol on other blockchains, including EOS and Tomochain.

However, the Kyber Waterloo proposal looks to be the project’s most promising foray into true interoperability. Currently, at the proof of concept stage, Kyber Waterloo aims to enable token swaps between the Ethereum and EOS networks.

Tomobridge

Finally, Tomochain also offers some token exchange functionality between Tomochain and Binance via the Tomobridge. It enables users to swap their native TOMO tokens for BEP-2 TOMOB tokens, which are listed on the Binance DEX.

Interoperability Protocols

Loom Network

Loom has been making strides in interoperability. Last September, it announced it was bringing the Dai stablecoin onto other blockchains, starting with Tron.

This feature would enable users to spend Dai on Tron’s dApps, potentially opening up the network to more users. Users could already spend tokens from other blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance, and Tron.

Soon afterward, Loom published another blog post outlining its plans to make the Loom Network token a “multi-chain token,” meaning it would be fully portable across the other blockchains already operating with the Loom Network.

When the protocol launches, users will be able to spend their Loom tokens across a multitude of platforms.

Cosmos

Cosmos is perhaps the most well-known blockchain interoperability project in the space at the moment. It’s made up of three components. First, there’s the Tendermint BFT consensus engine powers Cosmos’ proof-of-stake co.

There’s an SDK providing a modular framework for building interoperable, application-specific blockchains. Finally, there’s an inter blockchain communication messaging protocol that enables Cosmos to interact with other blockchains.

Dubbed the “internet of blockchains,” Cosmos is a promising project due to its early popularity in the space as well as for its technical specs.

Polkadot Network

Co-founded by Gavin Wood three years ago, Polkadot allows tokens, data, and governance tools to be transferred across various blockchains, oracles, and permissioned networks alike. Already they have integrated Chainlink, the leading decentralized oracle solution in the space.

The primary mechanism for this connection will be through a technology called parachains. These are not dissimilar from the sharding component found in Ethereum. Like mini-blockchains, parachains extend beyond the Polkadot network and execute their state locally. This autonomy allows for faster transaction speeds with a more diverse collection of data sources.

The project has yet to launch its mainnet, but users who participated in their ICO can begin claiming their DOT tokens before the beta launch on Coinbase.

Ethereum and Beyond

Although the majority of DeFi activity is occurring on Ethereum, it would be foolish to assume innovation isn’t also happening elsewhere. Interoperability helps solve this by providing common ground on which all blockchains can communicate.

Opening this dialogue would be a bounty not just for crypto users, but also for Ethereum itself.","Help wanted in the crypto industry

In Brief Despite the ups and downs in the crypto markets, demand for skilled workers has increased 26% year over year.

Wages are on average $105,000 (US).

Many of these jobs, such as smart contract engineer and head of staking, are radically new kinds of positions.

Whether you believe crypto spring is coming, the crypto jobs market is already starting to bloom.

Despite the ups and downs of the crypto markets, employment sites are still registering brisk demand for the blockchain savvy. Despite a mostly meh year in crypto, crypto-related jobs increased by 26%, according to an end of year study by Indeed.com.

An earlier report by Electric Capital helped paint a picture of that job market. Thanks to the growth of Bitcoin, DeFi and increased awareness of enterprise blockchain, the number of full-time blockchain developers had increased by 13% year-over-year by the summer 2019. For chart fans, Devin Banerjee from Linkedin even identified a correlation between the price of bitcoin and blockchain developer hiring.

Source: LinkedIn

The money is good, too. Mashing up data from Glassdoor.com, teQatlas reports salaries for Blockchain-related jobs in the US hit an average of $105,000 per year, more than two times the average salary in the US.

Location wise, according to job offers data, SF & NYC are the US hubs, London and Berlin lead for the EU and Singapore and Hong Kong in Asia.

The most sought after workers tend to be in the fields you’d expect: Engineering (31%), Operations (17%), Marketing (13%), Design (105), Sales (9%), according to 2019 job posts on Crytocurrencyjobs.co. The research reported a strong increase in demand for sales, design and compliance roles, which could signal a refocus on product launchand an industry that’s starting to mature (in a good way.)

At the same time, a number of jobs that never existed before are arising.

Let's take a look at some of these.

Yet there’s still much beyond our control. Recent events remind us that any number of forces are outside the grasp of even the strongest strongmen and the most democratic democracies.

Two of these untamables are timeless; disease and economic cycles and another is brand new, the Internet. And yet right now all three seem to be working in concert, wreaking havoc and vexing authority across the globe. It’s also interesting to note how the U.S., China, and Russia are being buffeted and or in one case even taking advantage of this environment.

Let’s start with the news which is disease.

Here we are, in the year 2020—40 years after we eradicated smallpox—wrestling with the COVID-19, a virus with a name that sounds like source code but is straight out of the Middle Ages. The power of this coronavirus extends well beyond the mere 2,867 and counting it has killed (as of my deadline.) In fact, if it was only those deaths, COVID-19 would be a blip. It’s the fear of more death that has (among thousands of disruptions) essentially halted air travel between the U.S. and China, crashed the Toronto stock exchange, closed schools in Japan and shut off Mecca to pilgrims.

Going forward who’s to say. “It’s almost impossible to judge how serious this is going to be,” says Jonathan Fenby, TS Lombard chairman of China research of COVID-19. “It’s an unknown unknown.” Ah yes that. (In case that reference is lost on you, I highly recommend watching this classic Rummy.)

Which segues nicely to economic cycles.

The coronavirus will also conceivably wipe out earnings growth for the S&P 500 this year (according to Goldman Sachs) and shave God-only-knows how many points off GDP in China, the U.S. and the world economy. “I view the odds of a global recession as pretty significant,” says Kenneth Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Ken is not alone in his view.

Story continues

The problem here is that for decades we’ve been living under the illusion that central bankers and their monetary tools would always be able to ride to our rescue. That narrative has become ever more powerful, especially after the 2008-2009 financial crises. A few rate cuts, a little QE and the sickest of economies will heal, the severest of downturns will be stymied. Now, with rates so low, the Federal Reserve et al is almost out of firepower. (Don’t get me started on negative rates being a help.) And yet Fed Chair Jay Powell assured us Friday that when it comes to coronavirus, “we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.” There you go again Jay.

In any event, I think the notion that we have been able to mitigate economic cycles to some degree is a dangerous one. It’s inevitable, isn’t it, that there will come a time when central bankers face something they can’t fix. COVID-19 could provide that moment. Ultra-low rates increase the likelihood.

Which brings us to the Internet and its role in current events.

‘A fire hose of information’

COVID-19 reminds me why computer scientists decided to name replicating programming bugs that modify other programs by inserting their own code, a virus, right?

In fact with COVID-19 we’re experiencing what the World Health Organization has dubbed the world’s first “infodemic,” which WHO characterizes as an “overabundance of information – some accurate and some not – that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.”

You think?

Or as one wag put it, our three sources of information here are the U.S. government, the Chinese government and Facebook. Good luck with that. Actually in the case of the latter source, that could be a proxy for the Russian government and its trolls to a degree. The South China Morning Post ran an AFP story that said “Russia [is] pushing fake news about the US using the outbreak to ‘wage economic war’ on China...” by deploying thousands of fake Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts.

“The Russians are good at identifying cleavages and social problems and ramping up division,” says Marek Posard, an associate sociologist at the RAND Corporation whose research focuses on technology and the military, who notes they did this with the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, saying AIDS was a U.S. government conspiracy.

National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins had warned me about this in an interview earlier this month. “There is an absolute flurry of crazy things being put forward in terms of what started this,” Collins said.

Ground zero of the infodemic happens to be in the same country of origin as COVID-19 — China. There, Xi Jinping’s government is facing significant problems waging a multi-faceted, multi-front digital war. On the one hand it’s suppressing all manner of information, both true and untrue. On the other hand, it’s pushing out its own propaganda.

Oh and at the same time, the Chinese government is providing what it insists to be accurate scientific medical updates (number of infections and deaths—which they say are dropping) to the World Health Organization. Complicated doesn’t begin to describe. “As skeptical as I usually am about Chinese official data, I’m even more skeptical of this case drop,” says Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House.

What then are the longer term implications of COVID-19? Well for one thing, the coronavirus has become a significant force of anti-globalism. It has closed down borders way more effectively than any trade war, nationalistic fervor, or even the most zealous border patrol agent could ever imagine.

Will we get a snap back, V-curve in terms of global flows lost by the coronavirus? Not 100% back to where we were before, I bet.

coronavirus

COVID-19 also exposes some of China’s weaknesses. It shows that the country continues to be a cradle of disease, a huge issue. And it suggests that the Chinese economic orthodoxy of fast growth trumping economic cycles won’t last forever either. (Xi JinPing & Co also clearly didn’t anticipate what would happen in Hong Kong when higher paying jobs and social mobility dried up for young people there—who connected to each via social media, by the way.) A command and control economy works well in the best of times, the rest of the time governments and societies need to be flexible. That’s not China’s strong suit. High levels of debt in China don’t help either. Or as Rogoff puts it, “a highly leveraged economy needs to keep moving to not fall down.”

The COVID-19 crisis also demonstrates that ironclad oversight of the Internet is probably not a long-term sustainable proposition for China. And yet we see that if China is too strict in controlling the Internet, then the U.S. position of an unfettered laissez-faire Internet is equally untenable. We learn again that when it comes to social media, the U.S. is at least partly not much more than a 329 million-person-rich-target for Russia. (And if COVID-19 ever really does hit our shores—heaven forbid—you will see a real sea of disinformation here.)

“In our national context we’re on the side of having a fire hose of information,” says Andrea Matwyshyn, a professor of policy and law at Penn State Law School who focuses on cybersecurity. “[In] a public health crisis having trusted sources of info is obvious in its importance. Trustworthy sources on other hand may not be getting the Internet play we like to see them have.”

So true.

As for the Russians, it’s kind of their time, right? They like to take advantage of what they would consider to be opportunities like COVID-19. Have you noticed by the way that while China has about 78,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the U.S has 60, Russia has only reported two cases? For now at least, it seems the Russians have it all figured out.

2020-03-01,"A month back, TRON founder Justin Sun made quite a buzz after he met veteran investor and Berkshire Hathaway chairman for dinner at a private country club in Omaha. In a series of tweets, Sun spoke about his experience and also informed that he has presented a Bitcoin as well as 1,930,830 TRONs to Buffett. Both, the Bitcoin and TRON were stored in a Samsung Galaxy Fold which Sun presented to the investor.

Word that Buffett owns Bitcoin spread like fire as he has been known for his anti-Bitcoin stance. However, the bubble soon burst as recently in an interview with CNBC, Buffett clarified that he still does not own any cryptocurrency let alone Bitcoin.

Reiterating his view, he said,

“Cryptocurrencies basically have no value. They don’t produce anything or mail investors checks. Instead, the value is derived from the belief that someone else will value them more highly in the future. In terms of value, you know zero.”

To which Sun further responded that the dinner with Buffett was not only to help the homeless people of SF but to discuss differences of opinions in investments & life experiences. “In terms of charity impact, the dinner was very successful! Mr. Buffett is such a great teacher of life, I learned so much!”

Earlier, Sun had tweeted, “@WarrenBuffett received his first Bitcoin. This lucky Bitcoin is safely stored in his #Samsung Galaxy Fold. Since I gifted him this Bitcoin, Bitcoin has increased by 16%! Hope it continues to moon! Brought Mr. Buffett 2 Galaxy Fold w/ #TRON built in. @WarrenBuffett is officially a $TRX owner! I gifted him 1,930,830 $TRX equivalent to his bday! Mr. Buffett joked he wished he was born later so that he could have more! ”

Meanwhile, having touched $10.5K on Valentine’s Day, this year, Bitcoin continues to see a downside.

Orbis has estimated that the global Bitcoin technology market that was valued at $293.66 Mn in 2019 is expected to reach $477.05 Mn by 2025, at a CAGR of 8.3% over the forecast period 2020 – 2025.

Indian Crypto Bulls Roadshow 2020

Amid Indian government seemingly confused over introducing a crypto bill in the Parliament, while Binance and OKEx have forayed into the Indian market through acquisition and partnership routes, London-based crypto startup Cashaa cofounder Kumar Gaurav and serial entrepreneur Gaurav Dubaey have announced plans to organise an Indian Crypto Bulls Roadshow 2020.

“The Roadshow will start on 12th March from the capital of India New Delhi and lead to Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Bangalore covering 5000+ KM, making it the largest crypto awareness movement in the world,” said Janina Lowisz, cofounder, Cashaa.

Crypto projects and influencers selected by public voting from this roadshow will represent India and speak at Consensus 2020 in New York. Companies from around the world will be presented in eight major cities across India in 20 days to create a ripple effect across the country, she added.

Iran’s General Proposes Nationwide Crypto



Having given Pakistan another grace period of four months the global intergovernmental organisation Financial Action Task Force has kept Iran on ‘High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action’ popularly called the blacklist.

As a result, Iran’s general Saeed Muhammed, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps called for his country’s government to start the utilisation of cryptocurrency. Addressing a crowd in Tehran, Muhammed for the usage of cryptocurrencies, with the exchange being capable of bilateral or multilateral monetary agreements.

“If Iran ratifies the Palermo and Terrorist Financing Conventions, in line with the FATF standards, the FATF will decide on next steps, including whether to suspend countermeasures. Until Iran implements the measures required to address the deficiencies identified with respect to countering terrorism-financing in the Action Plan, the FATF will remain concerned with the terrorist financing risk emanating from Iran and the threat this poses to the international financial system,” said the FATF.

Ex-Microsoft Engineer Convicted For Stealing $10 Mn In Bitcoin

A US District Court in Seattle has sentenced Volodymr Kvashuk, a Ukrainian citizen residing in Renton, Washington who worked first as a contractor at Microsoft, 20 years in prison for money laundering.

According to the file report and arguments put forward in the Court, Kvashuk was involved in the testing of Microsoft’s online retail sales platform, and used that testing access to steal “currency stored value” such as digital gift cards. Kvashuk resold the value on the internet, using the proceeds to purchase a $1.6 Mn dollar lakefront home and a $160K Tesla vehicle. He used a Bitcoin “mixing” service in an attempt to hide the source of the funds ultimately passing into his bank account. In all, over the seven months of Kvashuk’s illegal activity, approximately $2.8 Mn in Bitcoin was transferred to his bank accounts. Kvashuk had even filed fake tax return forms, claiming the Bitcoin had been a gift from a relative.

Following a five-day trial, Kvashuk was convicted of five counts of wire fraud, six counts of money laundering, two counts of aggravated identity theft, two counts of filing false tax returns, and one count each of mail fraud, access device fraud, and access to a protected computer for the fraud.","Cryptocurrency Could Kill Bank Lending, Warns Bank of England Deputy Governor

In the cryptocurrency economy, the supply of credit through the banking system could disappear, warned Bank of England Deputy Governor Sir Jon Cunliffe. That would be a change with “profound economic consequences,” he added, emphasizing the risks from Facebook’s Libra project and global stablecoins.

‘Profound Economic Consequences’

Bank of England Deputy Governor Sir Jon Cunliffe warned on Friday that bank lending could dry up in the cryptocurrency economy. In a speech given at the London School of Economics, he explained that there is “a new wave of technological development that enables the transactional use, not of central or commercial bank money, but rather a new form of asset, so-called ‘crypto-assets.'”

Cunliffe, who was previously a British envoy to the European Union, proceeded to talk about stablecoins. “There is certainly the possibility with stablecoins linked to large technology and social media platforms that it could become mainstream for people to move from holding all or much of the money now in ‘current accounts’ at banks to holding it in ‘stablecoin’ in virtual ‘wallets’ provided by non-banks,” the Bank of England’s deputy governor for financial stability described, adding:

In such a world, and depending how and whether stablecoins were backed with other financial assets, the supply of credit to the real economy through the banking system could become weaker or indeed disappear. That would be a change with profound economic consequences.

Risks From Facebook’s Libra and Stablecoins

The Bank of England has previously warned about Libra and other new forms of payment which they say must be considered carefully before they are allowed to launch. According to Cunliffe, “Authorities needed to ensure that any stablecoins used as money meet the standards applied to commercial bank money and passed other tests in areas such as competition, data protection and anti-money laundering,” Reuters conveyed.

Many governments have been on alert regarding Libra. Last week, the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors issued a statement after their first meeting this year addressing stablecoins. “We reiterate our statement in October 2019 regarding the so-called ‘global stablecoins’ and other similar arrangements that such risks need to be evaluated and appropriately addressed before they commence operation, and support the FSB’s [Financial Stability Board] efforts to develop regulatory recommendations with respect to these arrangements,” the statement reads. Global stablecoins are stablecoins that have the potential to achieve scale from launch.

The Bank of International Settlement (BIS) released a G7 Working Group research paper in October last year entitled “Investigating the impact of global stablecoins.” It highlights how these coins could “increase vulnerabilities in the broader financial system” through various channels.

Firstly, the paper suggests that retail deposits at banks may decline if users hold global stablecoins permanently in deposit-like accounts, resulting in banks increasing their dependence on more costly and volatile sources of funding. Secondly, the “easy availability of global stablecoins may exacerbate bank runs in times when confidence in one or more banks erodes,” the report details. “Third, if new financial intermediaries in the global stablecoin ecosystem captured a significant fraction of financial intermediation activity, this could further reduce bank profitability, potentially leading banks to take on more risks or to contract lending to the real economy.”

Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are set to revolutionize many industries, yet this is only the beginning.

However, despite the overall enthusiasm and excitement around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology’s capacity to revolutionize the world as we know it, many of the world’s richest men have expressed mixed opinions.

For instance, some billionaires, like Warren Buffett, are known to be staunch Bitcoin critics while others, like Tim Draper, are avid supporters. In 2018, for instance, Buffett predicted that Bitcoin, in particular, will have a “bad ending.”

On the other hand, billionaire investors like Tim Draper, Michael Novogratz and David Marcus have maintained a bullish stance on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Here is Forbes’s list of the world’s wealthiest individuals and their opinions on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

Jeff Bezos

Jeff Bezos is the world’s richest man with a net worth of $130 billion according to the 2019 Forbes list. The founder of Amazon, the e-commerce colossus, has been rumored countless times to have invested in Bitcoin. Plus, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has been quoted saying that he expects Bezos’s online retail giant to be the catalyst for the next Bitcoin bull run.

However, none of the rumors have been confirmed, and Amazon has denied any plans to accept Bitcoin or any other crypto on its platform. The only blockchain-positive development associated with Jeff Bezos is amazon’s cloud computing arm 2018 partnership with a blockchain startup called Kaleido.

Bill Gates

With a net worth that exceeds $100 billion, Bill Gates has featured among the world’s richest for quite some time. Although Gates had earlier shown enthusiasm for Bitcoin in 2014, where he told Bloomberg in an interview that Bitcoin was better than any currency, he has since retracted his remarks, noting that the anonymity of digital currencies is not good for transactions.

Furthermore, during a 2018 interview with CNBC, Gates said: “Bitcoin and ICOs are completely speculative.” However, like most critics, he added that blockchain, the underlying technology behind most cryptocurrencies, has its merits.

Warren Buffett

Buffett is a longtime critic of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Before the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, the longtime investor called Bitcoin a “mirage” that is “probably rat poison squared” and “not a currency.”

However, in a recent interview, Tron CEO Justin Sun outlines that Buffett was very open to new technologies. This came after Sun had a charity lunch with the Oracle of Omaha just a month ago, during which the young CEO tried to explain crypto’s potential to Buffett.

Even though Buffett went as far as accepting Ton (TRX) from Sun, Buffett maintained that he does not own any crypto and reiterated that he will never own crypto since it has “zero value.”

Bernard Arnault

With a business empire that spans over 70 brands including Sephora and Louis Vuitton, Bernard Arnault has featured among the world’s richest since 1985 when he bought Christian Dior. Since then, his luxury brands have grown, posting record sales — especially in 2018 — according to Forbes.

Although there are no official comments of Arnault about Bitcoin or blockchain technology, reports show that the billionaire teamed up with Microsoft Azure and ConsenSys last year to develop a blockchain platform that will track products produced by LVMH.

Other blockchain and crypto-related reports about Arnault include one, in which he rejected involvement in setting up a Belgian crypto trading company called Abesix Belgique.

Larry Ellison

Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, is worth over $50 billion and is listed as the world’s seventh-richest richest man. He is one of the few billionaires who have been vocal about Bitcoin and issued positive remarks about the merits of blockchain technology.

In a 2017 article by Business Insider, Ellison is quoted saying that blockchains are often thought of in the context of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies: “But increasingly, companies outside of finance are using blockchain technology to replace long-held authentication practices in law, real estate and shipping.”

Mark Zuckerberg

After Facebook’s debacle with the launch of its stablecoin cryptocurrency called Libra, a lot of people have expressed concern that if all of Facebook’s users adopted Libra as a currency, most of the world’s fiat currencies would be compromised.

However, while onlookers are concerned about the threat Libra would bring to local currencies including Bitcoin, Zuckerberg maintains that “when we do things that are going to be very sensitive for society, we want to have a period where we can go out and talk about them and consult with people and get feedback and work through the issues before rolling them out.”

Since 2018, Zuckerberg has held a positive stance particularly toward blockchain technology, saying: “The technology powering Bitcoin could help improve Facebook in the future.”

Michael Bloomberg

Apart from being listed among the top ten richest people in the world, Michael Bloomberg is currently running for as a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party in the 2020 United States presidential elections. Unlike other high ranking politicians, such as the U.S. President Donald Trump, who expressed negative opinions about Bitcoin and Facebook’s Libra last year, Bloomberg has shown a somewhat positive view on crypto and blockchain technology.

Bloomberg is quoted saying: “Cryptocurrencies have become an asset class worth hundreds of billions of dollars, yet regulatory oversight remains fragmented and undeveloped.” He also added: “For all the promise of the blockchain, Bitcoin and initial coin offerings, there’s also plenty of hype, fraud and criminal activity.”

With reports of surging popularity in the polls, Bloomberg’s policies on financial reforms are in the spotlight. The former New York mayor recognized cryptocurrencies as an asset class and has included policies in his campaign that will protect consumers from crypto-related fraud and clarify the responsibilities of crypto regulators with a framework to define initial coin offerings.

And a few other billionaires with strong thoughts on crypto

Ray Dalio

Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, has recently spoken in an interview with CNBC where he echoed concerns about the state of the global economy as have many Bitcoin investors and supporters, saying: “We’re in a spot in monetary policy where you can no longer stimulate the same way you did before.”

However, instead of advising those who are concerned about a coming global economic downturn to turn to Bitcoin, Dalio believes that gold is a much better safe haven than Bitcoin. In Dalio’s opinion: “There are two purposes of money: a medium of exchange and a store-hold of wealth. And Bitcoin is not effective in either of those cases now.”

In the interview, Dalio pointed out that Bitcoin is still too volatile to sufficiently act as a proper store of value.

Elon Musk

Recently, Elon musk has been in the spotlight for his cryptic tweets about Bitcoin. However, the CEO and founder of Tesla finally revealed that he is ""neither here nor there on Bitcoin.” Although Musk sees the value of Bitcoin, he believes that it is mostly used to perform illegal transactions:

“This sort of gets the crypto people angry, but there are transactions that are not within the balance of the law.”

He further added that although he sees “crypto as an effective replacement for cash,” he did not see it as a primary replacement. Granted, Musk does not fully endorse cryptocurrencies, however, he admits that there is a change coming to the financial industry and that banks need to watch out.

Jack Ma

According to a 2018 article by Bloomberg, Jack Ma issued a warning over cryptocurrencies, declaring Bitcoin to be a potential bubble. The founder of the giant e-commerce Company Alibaba and chairman of Ant Financial, a Chinese-based financial conglomerate, has revealed in the past that he pays special attention to Bitcoin and blockchain technology especially toward their capacity to establish a cashless society.

Even recently, during the 20th annual China Association of Science and Technology, Ma maintained his stance on Bitcoin being a possible bubble and pointed out blockchain as the “key that opens a treasure of chest of effective new technological tools.”

Michael Novogratz

Mike Novogratz, CEO and founder of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital Holdings and the former manager of the Fortress Investment Group, correctly predicted that Bitcoin would hit the $10,000 mark by the end of 2017.

Popularly known as Novo, the unlikely crypto hero has maintained that: “Bitcoin is going to be the digital gold.” According to Novogratz, Bitcoin is “the only one of the coins out there that gets to be a legal pyramid scheme. Just like gold is.”

To put his money where his mouth is, it is reported that Novogratz has invested about 30% of his fortune in cryptocurrencies. Despite making a huge loss on Bitcoin’s historic plunge in 2018 where his Galaxy digital Holdings reportedly lost $136 million, Novogratz remains undeterred.

He is quoted by Bloomberg saying that despite the frustration of investors losing money, the company has a “business that can break even” and that they have “plenty of cash to run the business for a long time.” Recently, the billionaire reiterated that he is even “more bullish on BTC” despite Bitcoin’s price struggle with volatility.

Tim Draper

In September 2019, venture capitalist Tim Draper doubled down on his previous prediction of Bitcoin hitting $250,000 by 2022 when he added that those predictions were “conservative.”

Draper has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin since June 2014 when he bought Bitcoin that had been seized and auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals service. The total amount of the Bitcoin he owned at the time was estimated to be worth $19 million.

Recently, Draper spoke to CNBC where he revealed that six months ago, he pulled his wealth out of public stock markets to hold more of it in his Bitcoin portfolio. In regards to the worldwide stock market plummeting due to coronavirus concerns, Draper revealed that his exposure was limited.

The Winklevoss twins

After Bitcoin’s price surge in 2017, Tyler and Cameron became the first Bitcoin billionaires. The two brothers and founders of Gemini, a crypto exchange, claim to own about 1% of the total Bitcoin in circulation.

Despite the seeming bad blood between the twins and Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, the Winklevoss twins have revealed in interviews that they believe Facebook’s Libra is positive news for the crypto space. Furthermore, according to a CNBC report, last year, the twins talked with Mark Zuckerberg before Facebook’s announcement of its Libra stablecoin. Currently, the Winklevoss brothers are counted among the world’s top Bitcoin millionaires.

Bill Harris

Bill Harris, the former CEO and co-founder of PayPal, is known for being one of the harshest Bitcoin critics. In an article he wrote in 2018, the former CEO of PayPal called Bitcoin a scam, adding that “it’s a colossal pump-and-dump scheme, the likes of which the world has never seen.”

During an interview with CNBC, Harris explained his position by pointing out that there is “no relation between value and usefulness” in the Bitcoin and crypto space. However, like most critics, Harris agrees that blockchain technology has “terrific applications.”","A former employee of Digitex, a digital asset derivatives trading platform, reportedly began leaking compromised know-your-customer (KYC) data via Telegram.

The stolen data includes passport and drivers license images and other sensitive information which allegedly belongs to over 8,000 traders registered on Digitex.

The Seychelles-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange told Cointelegraph that cannot provide any details, at the moment, about the data leak, but it’s in the process of seeking legal counsel.

The exchange’s management noted:

“Digitex Futures is aware of a leak of confidential data. We are not able to comment fully on the incident at this time and are currently seeking legal counsel. However, we can confirm that this was not an external hack but an internal security breach orchestrated by an ex-employee with a conflict of interest against the company. We will be releasing more information on the incident as soon as possible.”

According to sources familiar with the incident, the data of 8,000 users “has not been breached.”

They claim that only three user IDs have been compromised, however, the hacker claims that he has them all and is now “starting to post demands so as not to leak the rest.”

Via encrypted messaging service Telegram, the “Digileaker” said he has “the entire KYC documentation of every single user who has used the Digitex Treasury from its inception date until today.”

During an interview with crypto-related scam investigator CryptoVigilante, the Digileaker stated that he had used login information, which he stole when Digitex had submitted user IDs and other personally identifiable information to KYC provider Sum and Substance.

The hacker claims that the login “gives unrestricted access to all the KYC information of 8000+ customers,” which includes their personal documents, home or office address, phone numbers and other sensitive information like their IP addresses.

Digitex’s problems appear to be getting worse as a former employee of the firm recently took over its official Facebook account to publicly share users’ email addresses.

The exchange noted in a blog post, published earlier this month, that the security breach was an “internal” matter that had been carried out by a “scheming and highly manipulative ex-employee.”

Digitex’s management also claimed that “beyond [users’] email addresses, no other sensitive information was gathered or released.”","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

After successfully concluding a $45,000,000 ICO raise in August 2017, Daniel Wang and the Loopring team have finally released the beta to Loopring Exchange, a decentralized token exchange. For all its promise, however, this latest release has a series of issues that will likely keep the DEX from topping the DeFi charts.

Nonetheless, the founders’ honest take on these hurdles is a fresh change for the crypto space.

Loopring’s DEX Faces Old Problems

Loopring Exchange (Loopring.io) is the first application built on top of the Loopring Protocol. The two initiatives are distinct, much like relayers built on 0x Protocol.

It leverages ZK-Rollups, a scalability solution that draws from zero-knowledge proofs. Typically used in privacy-centric crypto projects, ZK-Proofs have also found a home in many layer 2 roadmaps. This is because implementing these proofs can reduce the amount of data included in a transaction.

Transactors broadcast relevant information (i.e., ETH addresses, values, network fees, and nonce) to the network. Relayers collect this information and create bundles. They stamp these bundles with a cryptographic proof that proves that all the transactions included in the bundle are valid. For their work, relayers earn a small fee relative to the amount they have staked in the network.

It’s almost like a certificate of authenticity, except math, rather than a centralized authority, proves it. More importantly, the technology is gaining a lot of traction in the Ethereum space.

In Loopring’s implementation of the technology, they are hoping that bundled transactions will help solve a common problem among decentralized exchanges (DEXes). In exchange for decentralization and security, DEXes face serious challenges in scalability.

In a post announcing the exchange, Wang wrote:

“It is 100% non-custodial, inheriting Ethereum-level security guarantees while capable to perform at a throughput 1000x greater (and 600x cheaper settlement cost) than the current state of the art layer-1 DEXes.”

Despite the promise for improved performance, Wang’s exchange likely won’t be able to meet the throughput outlined above. The Loopring Exchange can only handle 100 trades-per-second, according to the post.

The speed of transactions, the cost-per-trade, and opening up the DEX to a wider variety of crypto wallets are the next steps for Wang and his team. For reference, the cost of trade on Loopring.io is currently $0.0025, and MetaMask is the only compatible wallet on offer.

Interested traders are incentivized to test out the exchange via three reward programs, which began on Feb. 27 and will run to Apr. 30. There are currently only four trading pairs on the platform, including ETH/DAI, ETH/USDT, DAI/USDT, and LRC/ETH.","Jim Nantz, Calling His 30th Final Four, Says Opportunity To Call Games At Hinkle Fieldhouse 'Blew Me Away'The veteran CBS play-by-play announcer has been the voice of the tournament for three decades now and says calling games at the famed Butler arena 'was a thrill'.

2020-03-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - So bitcoin’s a currency, right? Well, yes, it can be used to buy, sell and price goods much like dollars and euros.

A commodity? Come to think of it, it does behave a lot like oil and gold - it can be bought and sold in cash markets or via derivatives such as futures.

What about a security? Many cryptocurrencies are, in a way. They’re issued like stocks in “initial coin offerings” and used to represent shares in online projects.

The debate may appear abstract, with little bearing on the hard-boiled world of finance, but it is attracting increasing interest from economists and lawyers who say it could have major implications for the future of cryptocurrencies.

How bitcoin and other digital coins are defined could shape how they are regulated around the world. In turn, the rules they are subject to could determine whether they make the leap from a niche to a mainstream asset.

So how will regulators treat them?

In the United States, federal watchdogs say they see elements of both securities and commodities, but like most major economies have not come up with a set of rules. The European Union, however, will outline a framework this year, which could see crypto wedged into existing regulations, or a whole new set of rules created.

For market players, how bitcoin and its kin are regulated will have serious ramifications.

Commodity markets operate with relatively little regulatory oversight. Securities, on the other hand, are typically subject to more onerous rules on price transparency, trade reporting and market abuse.

“When we’re going through the security process, we spend a lot of fees and lawyers to make sure we’re in compliance,” said Benjamin Tsai, president of Wave Financial, an investment manager in Los Angeles overseeing $40 million in crypto.

“It’s a lot more of a pain in the butt.”

CHARACTER CLUES

Some of the cryptocurrency identity crisis lies in the fact that bitcoin was originally conceived as a means of payment, but now rarely bears the hallmarks of dollars, euros or pounds.

It’s of little use as a store of value because of its volatility, and is hampered as a means of exchange by its slow network and high transfer costs.

A booming bitcoin lending market is offering clues to its character.

Bitcoin lending offers lines of credit to crypto firms earning money in cryptocurrencies, such as payment processors or miners, looking to secure traditional money for covering expenses. Also, traders who don’t want to sell their bitcoin holdings use them as collateral to borrow cash for use in algorithmic or high-frequency trading.

For those lending money, relatively high yields are an attractive proposition in an era of rock-bottom rates.

Key characteristics of this market, such as market-led price discovery and the motivation to seek liquidity, mirror that of commodities leasing, according to market players and economists.

“The commodities markets (analogy) is very fitting,” said Deeksha Gupta, an assistant professor of finance at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who has researched crypto.

“One of the biggest similarities is that they are also driven by people wanting to be able to get liquidity.”

The bitcoin lending market has grown quietly as an opaque corner of the cryptocurrency sector, which itself is notorious for its lack of transparency. While there’s little data with which to gauge the size of the lending market, it is widely seen to have expanded rapidly over the past year.

New York-based Genesis Capital, one of the biggest lenders in the market, said its outstanding loans soared late last year to around $545 million compared with $100 million a year earlier.

Implied interest rates in these markets - the price of borrowing bitcoin - stand at around 4-5%, Genesis CEO Michael Moro said. On platforms for people to lend cash against bitcoin, rates are as high as 8%.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Cryptocurrencies’ kinship to securities arises largely from their issuance and function in initial coin offerings, or ICOs, where they are used to raise traditional money.

ICOs are often held by companies seeking to raise funds for blockchain-related or other online projects. They raise capital by issuing digital coins, which grant holders access to the new system or software or a share in profits generated.

For instance, Switzerland-based Aragon - a management platform for decentralised organizations - raised about $25 million in 2017 issuing tokens that gave voting rights on how the system is developed.

Regulators may choose to treat different cryptocurrencies differently, depending on their specific characteristics, an approach taken by Britain last year.

Some players say any designation of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments akin to securities may be positive, with burdensome oversight balanced by the potential to allow funds to market cryptocurrencies to a wider pool of investors.

“If they were somehow classified as a financial instrument, then that would have the knock-on effect that they would be eligible for retail funds,” said Nic Niedermowwe, CEO of crypto fund Prime Factor Capital in London.","In brief US Presidential hopefuls are being asked about Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

Incumbent President Donald Trump has referred to cryptocurrencies as being ""based on thin air.""

Democratic challenger Mike Bloomberg has called for a “clear regulatory framework” for crypto.

If 2012 was the Facebook election and 2016 was dominated by Twitter, 2020 could be the year of the Bitcoin President. Blockchain voting may still be a way off, but 2020’s US Presidential candidates are starting to take Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seriously.

It's not surprising, given that 43% of Gen Z and Millennials think that crypto could replace the US financial system today. Whichever side of the fence they come down on, Presidential hopefuls are being asked about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain—and they’re increasingly expected to have an opinion.

So, what do 2020’s Presidential candidates think of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and the tech that underpins it?

Donald Trump is no fan of Bitcoin

Donald Trump (Image: Shutterstock)

The incumbent US President, Donald Trump, doesn’t mince his words when it comes to Bitcoin. In July 2019, he took to his favourite platform, Twitter, to voice his opinion on the cryptocurrency. “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money,” he wrote, describing their value as “highly volatile and based on thin air”.

I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019

Trump came down firmly on the side of fiat currency, calling the US Dollar the “real currency in the USA”, and saying that unregulated crypto assets fuel illegal behaviour, “including drug trade and other illegal activity.”

Accordingly, Trump’s $4.8 billion budget for the 2021 fiscal year looks to reallocate the Secret Service to the US Treasury department, in part to fight crypto crime. The 2021 budget states that, ""Technological advancements in recent decades, such as cryptocurrencies and the increasing interconnectedness of the international financial marketplace, have resulted in more complex criminal organizations and revealed stronger links between financial and electronic crimes and the financing of terrorists and rogue state actors.”

Trump also had strong words for Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency, saying that it will “have little standing or dependability,” suggesting that Facebook is trying to set itself up as a bank, and that companies attempting to do so, “must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations”.

....Similarly, Facebook Libra’s “virtual currency” will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019

However, while the President himself may not be a fan of cryptocurrency, several of his appointees are enthusiastic crypto advocates. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, a Trump appointee, won over crypto fans with her dissent in an SEC decision to reject a Bitcoin ETF—earning herself the affectionate moniker of “Crypto Mom”. And Trump’s acting White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, co-founded the bipartisan Blockchain Caucus, describing blockchain as a technology with the potential to “revolutionize the financial services industry, the U.S. economy and the delivery of government services.”

So, even if President Trump is personally cautious about blockchain and crypto, the Trump Administration is taking a more balanced view of it.

Bernie Sanders wants to bank the unbanked—with post offices

Bernie Sanders (Image: Shutterstock)

Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, often talks about starting a political revolution. But his financial policies may be at odds with the financial revolution many Bitcoin lovers are looking for.

Granted, it's difficult to pinpoint where Bernie Sanders stands on cryptocurrency issues; the full Senate has rarely taken up relevant legislation so he has no applicable voting record to look at. Moreover, Sanders doesn't sit on committees that regularly deal with such issues, such as the banking or commerce committees.

However, as you might imagine from a candidate who rails against economic policies that benefit the top 1% of Americans, Sanders has plenty of views on money. In his plan for ""Fair Banking for All,"" the senator shows a keen interest in expanding access to financial services for the 63 million Americans who are unbanked or underbanked. But instead of offering them crypto accounts, he wants US post offices to fill the gap. Americans would be able to get small, low-interest loans and checking and savings accounts from the postal service, which would also run an online banking platform.

The online component is embedded in some of Sanders' other plans and could play in cryptocurrency's favor. Unsurprisingly, Sanders supports net neutrality, which would restrict Internet providers from blocking or slowing user access to specific sites. He also wants to ""increase the FCC definition of minimum broadband speeds to 100mbps download speeds and 10mbps upload speeds"" while simultaneously investing $150 billion toward ""resilient, affordable, publicly owned broadband infrastructure.""

That could add up to a ripe environment for cryptocurrency, as others have pointed out, even if the overall tenor of his democratic socialist policies is anathema to those crypto enthusiasts who see Bitcoin as the embodiment of libertarian principles.

Why Elizabeth Warren is worried about crypto

Elizabeth Warren (Image: Maverick Pictures/Shutterstock)

Massachusetts Senator and Democratic Party contender Elizabeth Warren has taken a measured view of cryptocurrency. In an October 2018 Senate hearing on “Exploring the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Ecosystem,” she described cryptocurrencies as “easy to steal” and highlighted a June 2018 study by ICO advisory firm Satis Group which reported that 80% of ICOs in 2017 were scams.

However, she conceded that while they could empower scammers and criminals, virtual currencies “are an interesting innovation that at least theoretically could provide benefits to consumers.”

I'm worried about consumers getting hurt. Elizabeth Warren

Warren is erring on the side of caution, though; asked whether she was concerned about Americans buying up Bitcoin, Warren told Yahoo! Finance, “I’m worried about consumers getting hurt”.

As part of her broader campaign against Big Tech’s overreach, Warren has taken aim at Facebook. Following the July 2019 announcement that the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs would hold a hearing on Facebook’s planned cryptocurrency, Libra, Warren tweeted, “Facebook has too much power and a terrible track record when it comes to protecting our private information. We need to hold them accountable—not give them the chance to access even more user data. #BreakUpBigTech.”

Joe Biden is ambivalent about Bitcoin

The one-time vice-president and now Presidential candidate has said little of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. But a political action committee campaigning on his behalf has. In 2016, when Biden first announced his intentions to run for office, the group, called Draft Biden 2016, accepted contributions in crypto.

While Biden hasn’t commented on the super-PAC, Joseph Schweitzer, the group’s director, said, “This is in keeping with Vice President Biden’s strong support of technology and innovation throughout his career.”

Mike Bloomberg wants regulation of crypto

Mike Bloomberg (Image: JStone/Shutterstock)

Billionaire Mike Bloomberg entered the presidential race in November 2019, promising to “defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America.” Since tech-favorite—and big Bitcoin proponent—Andrew Yang dropped out, Bloomberg has taken to courting the crypto crowd, or at least, the crypto skeptics.

Regulatory oversight remains fragmented and undeveloped Mike Bloomberg

“Cryptocurrencies have become an asset class worth hundreds of billions of dollars, yet regulatory oversight remains fragmented and undeveloped,” Bloomberg wrote in a new proposal. “For all the promise of the blockchain, Bitcoin, and initial coin offerings, there’s also plenty of hype, fraud and criminal activity.” As such, Bloomberg is calling for a “clear regulatory framework” for crypto.

But if anything, this puts him in line with Trump’s plan of tackling the crypto industry by getting the Secret Service to keep tabs on it.

Amy Klobuchar is curious about crypto criminals

Amy Klobuchar (Image: Juli Hansen/Shutterstock)

Amy Klobuchar, Senator for Minnesota, has taken part in plenty of congressional hearings on cryptocurrency. But she hasn’t taken a strong public stance on the subject.

The Midwesterner and former lawyer likes to call herself ""the Senator next door,” and positions herself as the Democrats’ hope to regain the US heartland. She exceeded expectations in the first two states to vote in the Democratic nominating contests, Iowa and New Hampshire.

To date, Klobuchar’s sole contribution to the crypto debate is a question she asked during the November 2017 congressional hearing on money laundering and terrorist financing. She inquired whether cryptocurrencies would make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track criminals.

While she may be ambivalent about crypto, Klobuchar is a privacy advocate. In November, she shared privacy concerns about Google’s health data sharing agreement with hospital network Ascension.

Tulsi Gabbard bought ETH and LTC

Tulsi Gabbard (Image: Crush Rush/Shutterstock)

Gabbard, the US Representative for Hawaii’s 2nd congressional district, is one Presidential candidate who’s definitely aware of cryptocurrency; according to a Financial Disclosure Report filed in August 2018, she bought more than $1,000 of Ethereum and Litecoin in December 2017, with the value of each asset listed as between $1,001 and $15,000.

Unless she sold quickly, Gabbard’s made a loss on her investment, with crypto prices having declined sharply since she made her purchases. On the day she bought the tokens (December 12, 2017), ETH traded between $526 and $659; today it’s trading at $224, a drop of around 66%. Litecoin traded between $230 and $339 on the day Gabbard made her purchase; now it’s trading for $60, a drop of around 75%. Whether Gabbard’s investment has colored her view of cryptocurrency is unclear.

Since declaring her crypto purchases, Gabbard has spoken up for blockchain technology, as co-sponsor of Congressman Warren Davidson’s (R-Ohio) Token Taxonomy Act, which aims to exempt some tokens and digital assets from federal securities laws. In a statement accompanying her co-sponsorship of the act, Gabbard said, “In Hawaii and across America, local and state leaders are looking at the potential for blockchain technology to create and expand economic opportunity.”

Bill Weld is no friend of the Fed

Bill Weld (Image: Bill Weld/Instagram)

Bill Weld, who four years ago ran as Gary Johnson's VP nominee on the Libertarian Party ticket, is this year running as a Republican challenger to President Trump. Or, at least, trying to run—seven state Republican parties have cancelled their caucuses or primaries. He's also missed filing deadlines in several other states. Elsewhere, Weld is on the ticket, where he's trying to peel off conservative voters who have soured on the president.

Because Weld is running an (extremely) uphill campaign, his policy positions are less clear than some other candidates'. But the former governor of Massachusetts might be able to draft off of his association with Johnson and, more generally, libertarians.

Bitcoin OGs from the days when BTC was worth less than $1,000 may give him a boost for his association with Johnson, who was the only nominee from a major political party to accept Bitcoin donations for his 2016 campaign. Moreover, Joe Hunter, the communications director for both Johnson 2016 and Weld 2020, said Johnson ""would look favourably on pardoning Ross Ulbricht,"" the creator of the BTC-enabled black market Silk Road.

Weld's website doesn't illuminate his take on cryptocurrency, but it does contain at least one interesting passage for crypto sympathizers on US monetary policy: ""The [Federal Reserve Bank] holds a distinct power over the economy through its unilateral setting of interest rates. When big government in Washington wishes to raise spending without raising taxes, it simply looks to the Fed to print more money. This is unacceptable.""

While he wouldn't abolish the Fed, Weld says he would audit it. It’s a start, eh Bitcoiners?

John McAfee is pro-crypto, for all the wrong reasons

John McAfee (Image: Decrypt)

Having valiantly retired from shilling dubious cryptocurrency projects to commit in earnest to his baffling Presidential run, John McAfee’s ideal placement for frontrunner pro-crypto candidate is in doubt. “People ask why I am no longer doing Blockchain promotions. It is very time consuming,” he wrote in a series of tweets late last year. “My Presidential Campaign will be starting in earnest in January and I cannot do both. I am in no way abandoning crypto; only the task of promoting specific projects.”

Nevertheless, McAfee’s crypto credentials are stellar, and he still wants to make cryptocurrencies the “major focus of the 2020 campaign.” The former antivirus tycoon, current fugitive and libertarian nominee—although he claims the libertarian establishment has paid little attention to him—is running his campaign from international waters, having been indicted by US tax authorities for ""unspecified IRS crimes of a felonious nature."" Famously, he promised to chow down on his own John Thomas in the event of Bitcoin hitting $1 million by 2020; yet he’s also the one who subsequently reneged on that promise. If that weren't enough, he also begs that you do not vote for him because it is “absurd to spend money in order to become a civil servant’.","Lloyd’s has launched an insurance policy to protect cryptocurrency held in online wallets against theft or other malicious hacks.

The first of its kind liability policy, with flexible limits from as little as £1,000 (US$1,281), was created by Lloyd’s syndicate Atrium in conjunction with Coincover to protect against losses arising from the theft of cryptocurrency held in online, hot wallets.

It is a new type of liability insurance policy with a dynamic limit that increases or decreases in line with the price changes of crypto assets, which means the insured will always be indemnified for the underlying value of the asset even if this fluctuates over the policy period, explained Lloyd’s in a statement.

The policy is backed by a panel of other Lloyd’s insurers, which includes TMK and Markel, all of whom are members of Lloyd’s Product Innovation Facility (PIF).

As part of the Future at Lloyd’s ambition to be the world’s most customer-centric digital insurance platform, the facility is an important step towards building a marketplace that offers better value for the changing and diverse needs of customers through highly-responsive, cutting-edge risk management products and services, said Lloyd’s in the announcement about the product.

This is the second new insurance product to be backed by PIF members in recent months. The first – a profit protection policy for hotels with an innovative event-based trigger – was launched in September.

“There is a growing demand for insurance that can protect cryptocurrency as it becomes increasingly popular,” said Matthew Greaves, underwriter, Atrium. “It is a testament to Lloyd’s that the market has put together an innovative solution to mitigate these new risks and protect against theft – from physical as well as online vaults – thereby providing customers with piece of mind that their assets are safe.”

“We are delighted to have worked with Atrium and the Lloyd’s PIF members to bring such a unique and timely solution to the crypto asset market,” commented David Janczewski, CEO, Coincover. “As the crypto asset market heats up again at the start of 2020, a new wave of crypto-curious customers are standing by at the ready to jump in, having previously been put off by the lack of adequate protection against theft and loss.”

With this new policy, Janczewski added, “we can remove these barriers and broaden the appeal of crypto. It represents another step forward in enabling cryptocurrency adoption.”

James Gadbury, senior broker, Prospect, the insurance broker that worked with Atrium and Coincover to create the policy, said: “We are delighted to have provided Coincover with this new insurance cover, which demonstrates the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of Lloyd’s. We believe Prospect and the wider insurance market should support this rapidly developing sector as it moves into the mainstream.”

“As more money flows into the crypto asset market, losses from hacks are on the rise. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency companies have found ways to protect their digital assets from theft and, by working closely with Lloyd’s underwriters, to insure losses that do slip through the net,” according to Trevor Maynard, head of Innovation at Lloyd’s.

“Lloyd’s is the natural home for insurance innovation because of the unique ability of syndicates to collaborate to insure new things. I am delighted that our Product Innovation Facility – now with almost £150 million [US$192.2 million] of capacity and 27 underwriters, is providing a fast route to increase insurance capacity for difficult and hard-to-insure risks,” Maynard continued.

According to various resources tracking hash rate growth on the bitcoin network, the metric was circling its highest value ever as of March 1, Cointelegraph reported.

Hash rate refers to the combined computing power that miners are dedicating to validating transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. The higher the value, the more power there is – this implies that miners believe in the profitability of mining, and have a desire to increase network security.

Data from monitoring resource Bitinfocharts put bitcoin’s hash rate at just over 120 quintillion hashes per second on Sunday, the latest day for which figures are currently available.

Another monitor, from wallet provider Blockchain, put the figure at closer to 140 quintillion hashes per second after picking up a spike in activity over the weekend.

Bitcoin 1-year hash rate chart. Source: Blockchain

As Cointelegraph reported, hash rate tools can only estimate activity. In 2019, what many thought was a sudden drop in hash rate was subsequently shown not to be miners exiting bitcoin.

Halving flashpoint

In May, when the new bitcoins released to miners each block will halve from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, expectations are high that increased competition will boost hash rate still further.

PlanB, the analyst who created the highly-accurate stock-to-flow price forecasting model for Bitcoin, recently reinforced his belief in the theory.

For him, the 2020 halving will produce similar effects to the 2012 and 2016 events – a catalytic impact on hash rate, difficulty and, of course, price.","San Francisco-based Coinbase is still preparing behind the scenes for a presence in the Japanese market.

The popular cryptocurrency exchange, which previously applied for an operating license in the country, has now become a second-class member of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) – the self-regulatory organization given the mandate to oversee the industry by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in 2018.

Announcing the news on Monday, the JVCEA said local firms Digital Asset Markets Inc. and Tokyo Hash have also joined the group alongside Coinbase as second-class members.

Coinbase has had a Japanese exchange in its sights since as far back as 2016, after it received a $10.5 million investment from a group that included Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ and Mitsubishi UFJ Capital.

In mid-2018, the firm named a chief executive for its local subsidiary, and later in the year indicated it was confident it would receive an operating license from the FSA before the end of 2019. That hasn’t happened as of early 2020.

In becoming a member of the SRO, Coinbase joins other second-class member firms “applying for or planning to apply for virtual currency exchange registration as prescribed in Article 63-3 of the Payment Services Act,” according to the JVCEA.

The body aims to ensure its exchange members carry out “sound” business as set out in local law. As an official SRO, it has the power to put in place rules for the nation’s exchanges and take action over any violations.

The JVCEA was founded to restore confidence in the industry after a series of major hacks on exchanges including the industry’s biggest ever breach at Coincheck, which lost $420 million in January 2019.","Japanese tech company LINE wants to provide U.S. traders a new dollar gateway to cryptocurrencies with a new exchange.

Turkey seems to be on a tear when it comes to cryptocurrency. And Binance is leading the pack at bringing more fiat on-ramps. Now, in a match made in heaven, the largest cryptocurrency exchange and Turkey’s biggest bank Akbank have teamed up.

Turkey Steams Ahead with Cryptocurrency Projects

According to a post on the company blog this morning, Binance is going all-in on Turkey by teaming up with its largest bank. Turkish users will now be able to instantly deposit and withdraw using Turkish Lira. This is the:

Perhaps this should come as no surprise. The Turkish government appears to be getting serious where cryptocurrency is concerned.

Several months ago, they confirmed plans for a Turkish central bank-backed digital currency in 2020. The country’s largest settlements bank Takasbank has begun digitizing gold and other commodities.

Turkey’s seventh-largest city Konya also revealed plans for its own cryptocurrency called ‘City Coin’ recently. It plans to use this to drive improvements in local government services and infrastructure. And Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was recently announced as a speaker at the upcoming Istanblock conference in Istanbul in April.

Beyond government initiatives, what attracts Binance the most has to be the high level of awareness and usage of cryptocurrencies in this country. According to a survey by Statistica one in five Turkish people own or use cryptocurrencies to some degree–the highest in the world.

Akbank and Binance Team Up

Akbank, as CZ reminds us, is not only the first bank to integrate directly with Binance. It’s also the biggest bank in Turkey:

According to the announcement, Binance will now offer support for the Lira in Turkey. Users will be able to interact in a manner of ways, either through Binance desktop or its iOS App – “with the most competitive fees in Turkey.”

Binance with its many different businesses from Cloud services to derivatives seems to be expanding everywhere. But one of its main achievements has to be the amount of fiat on-ramps the company is achieving. The exchange now provides support for a number of global currencies including the Argentine peso, Turkish Lira, British Pound Thai Bhat. CZ stated:

As part of our mission to continue working on increasing the freedom of money worldwide and notably in a country that is fast-adopting digital assets, we are expanding the available options to lower the barrier to entry.

He added that as the industry grows, so should the products and services:

the availability and process of investing, exchanging and trading crypto will become more and more seamless.

2020-03-03,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed banks to handle cryptocurrency transactions from exchanges and traders, overturning a central bank ban that dealt the thriving industry a major blow.

A man walks past an electric board showing exchange rates of various cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (top L) at a cryptocurrencies exchange in Seoul, South Korea December 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had in April 2018 ordered financial institutions to break off all ties with individuals or businesses dealing in virtual currency such as Bitcoin within three months.

The ban led to plummeting trade volumes and exchanges shutting their businesses.

A three-judge Supreme Court bench said in their ruling that while the central bank had the power to take pre-emptive action, the court questioned the “proportionality” of such measures.

“RBI needs to show at least some semblance of any damage suffered by its regulated entities. But there is none,” the court said in a 180-page ruling.

Nischal Shetty, chief executive of the WazirX cryptocurrency exchange, welcomed the ruling saying investment had stopped “in the crypto and blockchain space in India”, but that would now change.

However, the industry still faces hurdles as a government panel has recommended a ban on all private cryptocurrencies.

In July, the panel also recommended jail of up to 10 years and heavy fines for anyone dealing in digital currencies.

The government has yet to act on those recommendations or to finalise regulations around cryptocurrencies.

The government and central bank have repeatedly warned the public about the risk of cryptocurrencies.

If the government were to follow the panel’s recommendations, it could signal the end of digital currencies in India.

Anirudh Rastogi, the founder of Ikigai Law, a firm that represented crypto exchanges in the lawsuit, said there was an “overarching fear” that the government might still introduce a law against cryptocurrencies.

“But for now, this is a good move as the exchanges can go back to crypto-to-fiat trade which had stopped,” Rastogi said.

Governments around the world have been looking into ways to regulate cryptocurrencies but no major economy has taken the drastic step of placing a blanket ban on owning them, even though concern has been raised about the misuse of consumer data and its possible impact on the financial system.

The need for regulations surrounding digital currencies has also gained momentum after Facebook Inc announced plans to launch its cryptocurrency, Libra.

Several central banks around the world are also considering issuing their own digital currencies in the next few years, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said in a report in January.

India’s government-appointed committee had also recommended considering the launch of an officially backed digital currency for use in the country, which can function like bank notes and be regulated by the central bank.

Eyes will now be on the RBI to see if it comes up with new regulations surrounding digital currencies that can address regulatory concerns as well as aid growth in the ecosystem, said L Viswanathan, a partner at the Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas law firm.

“This might also catalyse the potential for the use of blockchain in diverse areas,” Viswanathan said of the ruling.","Quantitative crypto fund Strix Leviathan says the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty could be false—considering last week’s nearly unprecedented stock market sell-off, where the S&P 500 suffered its sharpest correction since the 2008 financial crisis and BTC shed nearly 15 percent in USD terms.

The number-one cryptocurrency by market capitalization started to tumble in tandem with the S&P on February 19 as market panic ensued on account of the novel coronavirus. With nearly 3,200 deaths and 91,000 cases of the virus having been reported across 85 countries, the pandemic appears to have triggered a flight to safety in global markets.

Digital gold no more?

Bitcoin has consolidated its reputation as a risk-off asset in recent months, with many having cited the coin’s correlation with gold, in January, after the United States’ lethal drone strike on the Iranian military commander-in-chief.

At the time, analysts like Andrew Kang argued Bitcoin’s price movement during the US-Iran affair proved the market had “strengthened its belief” in BTC as a store of value and hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.

Bitcoin has never shown much correlation to gold or other SOVs. That is, until now. This is incredibly bullish for BTC. Here's Why 👇 pic.twitter.com/nyOI0Swkge — Andrew Kang (@Rewkang) January 8, 2020

Risk-on or risk-off? Maybe too early to say

But according to Strix, Bitcoin’s latest downtrend suggests that the so-called ‘digital gold’ may be no less “susceptible to market panic” than other assets during risk-off market cycles.

Gold, a prototypical risk-off asset, has expectedly been a strong performer during the coronavirus crisis with investors opting out of stocks in favor of more defensive positions. On February 24, just four days after the S&P started to slide south, gold broke out to make a seven-year high.

The Seattle-based quant fund said both Bitcoin and Ethereum were affected by the global flight to safety as they are “poor currencies” on account of their volatility (Ethereum plunged 25 percent over the course of the global sell-off). Ultimately, however, the hedge fund admitted it is simply too early to tell whether these cryptocurrencies qualify as risk-on or risk-off assets. They stated:

“Some pundits in January pointed to Bitcoin acting like a risk-off asset as evidence of its status as a safe haven store-of-value. Others point to the risk-on behavior with crypto tracking equities throughout February as proof of its status as a speculative asset. Competing behaviors signal that the market doesn’t know what Bitcoin is going to be used for at full adoption, let alone what the other thousands of crypto assets end-state will be.”

Post-virus outbreak, BTC seems to have befuddled market spectators and further inspired these “competing behaviors.” Crypto analyst and trader Alex Kruger, for example, stated he has been trading Bitcoin as a “clear risk-on asset” in recent weeks.

$BTC has been trading like a clear risk-on asset since last week. This has been surprising in some ways, unsurprising in others, and could be something valuable to keep in mind regardless. Past correlations do not matter much when in uncharted waters. — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) March 2, 2020

But one metric that does provide more clarity around the narrative of Bitcoin as a store of value—albeit perhaps not a safe-haven or “risk-off” store of value—is a risk-adjusted return. Even in spite of its recent downturn, BTC has retained status as a top-performing asset by Sharpe ratio, above gold, stocks, U.S. real estate, oil, bonds, and emerging currencies.

It has published five characteristics of a cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies are not to be confused with electronic money.

The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) of Germany has officially defined cryptocurrencies as financial instruments, providing further regulatory clarity. This makes it easier for those spending cryptocurrencies and will give some relief to businesses built around them.

According to the translation of BaFin’s press release published on March 2, cryptocurrencies are now classified as the “digital representations of value” that have the following characteristics:

Not issued or guaranteed by any central bank or public body;

Don’t have the legal status of currency or money;

Can be used by individuals or legal entities as a means of exchange or payment;

Serve investment purposes;

Can be transmitted, stored and traded electronically.

The document also notes that cryptocurrencies are not to be confused with various types of “electronic money” which have other sections of the law dedicated to them.

The new classification was based on definitions written by other regulators worldwide, such as the Financial Action Task Force. BaFin also clarified that prior to this, cryptocurrencies did not fall into any of the generally recognized pre-existing categories in Germany.

As Decrypt reported mid-January, new money laundering rules are shaking up the European Union’s cryptocurrency landscape as its 28 member states are now required to comply with AMLD5—the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive which came into force at the beginning of 2020.

According to the new licensing rules set out by financial watchdogs in the UK, the Netherlands and Austria, crypto exchanges and custodians must register with their local regulator and comply with know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures to disclose their traders’ identities and report suspicious activity.","An hour of high-volume trading on Tuesday resulted in bitcoin (BTC) trading lower, giving back nearly half of the previous day’s gains.

At around 3 p.m. ET (15:00 UTC), trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges spiked as bitcoin prices jumped from $8,674 to $8,898, almost a percentage point, within one hour. Coinbase, for example, saw volume rise from 437 trades to 1,699 trades from 14:00 to 15:00 UTC. Bitcoin is trending downward overall, dropping from a 24-hour high of $8,974 and currently in the red at 1.92 percent.

During that hour, the Federal Reserve announced a 50 basis point interest rate cut in an effort to boost the U.S. economy and ease concerns about the spread of coronavirus.

This comes after bitcoin prices saw a 4.5 percent gain on Monday. The Standard & Poors 500 also showed positive gains Monday, up 4.6 percent. Year to date, bitcoin is up 21 percent while the S&P is down 5.5 percent.

Other notable cryptocurrency price movements as of Tuesday at 20:00 UTC include Neo (NEO) down 5 percent, ether (ETH) in the red 3 percent and XRP (XRP), down 2 percent. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) is out of the doghouse, with a 1 percent gain in the past 24 hours.","Last month, Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive of Ripple, made a bold statement about his hopes for his company.

“I hope that in five years we’re not just Amazon books, we’re Amazon,” he said in an interview with CNN.

With a $1.07 trillion market cap, Amazon is tough to match–as a company, Ripple was valued at $10 billion after raising $200 million in a Series C funding round in December, and at press time, XRP’s market cap was hovering around $10.3 billion, holding a place as the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. (XRP is the native token of the Ripple ecosystem.)

On the other hand, however, Ripple has progressed quite a bit over the course of the last two years–recently, the company was given the second place on Forbes’s list of the most valuable companies in fintech. Stripe (valued at $35 billion) was at the top of the list; Coinbase (valued at $8.1 billion) was in third place.

A “corporate coin”?

And the company is seeking to grow–Garlinghouse also spoke of the possibility of a Ripple IPO in 2020, though he has made it clear that any talk of a public offering is purely theoretical at this point: “in the next 12 months, you’ll see IPOs in the crypto/blockchain space,” he commented at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos.

“We’re not going to be the first and we’re not going to be the last, but I expect us to be on the leading side,” he added. “It’s a natural evolution for our company.”

While some analysts have theorized that a Ripple IPO could damage the price of XRP, the fact that Ripple may be considering such a move could be counted as evidence that the company is considering a step further into the public financial sphere, thereby further positioning itself as a sort of “corporate coin” with corporate-, enterprise-, and even government-friendly remittance and cryptocurrency networks.

Integrating and connecting with banks is an important part of Ripple’s growth strategy around the world

Indeed, Jack Choros, chief marketing officer at CryptoRadar, told Finance Magnates that although “facilitation of large bank transfers between central banks” is currently “the most important use case for Ripple.”

Choros explained that Ripple has leveraged its relationships with banks, “making it way cheaper for them to transfer money.”

“[Ripple] brokered long-term transfer agreements with banks all over the world that need liquidity and need to move money fast,” Choros said. Therefore, “there’s a big opportunity for Ripple as a private business to take a nice cut of such large multimillion-dollar transfers.”

And Ripple does seem to be making an impact on the worldwide banking industry–earlier this month, Bank Asia, a Bangladesh-based bank that holds $3.4 billion in assets, joined Ripple’s blockchain-based financial services network, RippleNet.

Additionally, a recent report by the World Economic Forum named Ripple specifically alongside JPMorgan Chase’s “JPM Coin” as an example of a “crypto-asset designed for inter- or intrabank payments and settlements” that was “most relevant for wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).”

A number of Twitter users have also pointed out that a network like XRP’s may have a greater array of use cases within banking than a network like JPMCoin’s because of its capabilities to facilitate interbank transfers as well as intrabank transfers.

Agree… that's exactly what Brad was talking about years ago. Banks like JPM coin are so-called ""walled gardens"" and they are not solving fragmented cross-border banking problem — XRP_Cro (@stedas) February 14, 2020

Ripple was also named alongside Ethereum by the Central Bank of France as a possible alternative blockchain for certain parts of a CBDC: “Attributes of a unit of the CBDC may be integrated in a crypto asset circulating on another blockchain, which is possible on Ethereum & Ripple. It would then be possible to use the unit on this blockchain,” the report said.

“The [same] reason why crypto purists despise Ripple as a project is the same reason central banks love it.”

In some cases, Ripple’s networks have already been adopted for usage by banks: on the Ripple website, it reads that “RippleNet makes it easy to connect and transact across a robust network of 200+ financial institutions,” including a number of banks.

Suggested articles Top 6 Crypto Trading Tools You Should Use in 2021Go to article >>

This has caused some controversy in the cryptocurrency community: “the [same] reason why crypto purists despise Ripple as a project is the same reason central banks love it,” Jack Choros commented.

Indeed, the company has been criticized by the crypto community for being too centralized–most recently, a proposed “Deletable Accounts” feature, which would “[allow] XRPL accounts to be removed from the ledger and recover most of the reserve locked in the accounts for spam prevention,” caught flack from crypto insiders: Bitcoinist reporter Christina Comben called the proposed feature “disturbingly centralized at best, horribly over-controlling at worst.”

However, the fact that Ripple may not be as decentralized as, say, the Bitcoin network, the company doesn’t necessarily intend it to be so: “Ripple is a privately owned company that runs a semi-public blockchain,” Jack Choros explained.

Therefore, “the goal is not to disrupt the banking system,” like Bitcoin is arguably designed to do, “but rather to make the banking system more competitive and price friendly. Ripple wants to use decentralized technology to benefit centralized private companies and banks.”

Forming relationships with regulators has been an important part of Ripple’s growth strategy

And indeed, Ripple’s perhaps “semi-centralized” nature as a whole may have also provided the company with some leverage when it comes to forming positive relationships with regulators.

Brad Garlinghouse insists that Ripple’s emphasis on compliance has been a key part of Ripple’s growth: in a recent interview with CNN, Garlinghouse said that “once regulators understand you’re not circumventing regulatory frameworks, they get very comfortable very quickly.”

INTERVIEW PART I 👇🏼

""Once regulators understand you're not circumventing regulatory frameworks they get very comfortable very quickly,"" @Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse explains why he's on a mission to educate regulators around the world. pic.twitter.com/2PMVvj3PZU — Julia Chatterley (@jchatterleyCNN) February 17, 2020

“A lot of what I am doing […] is meeting with regulators, meeting with very senior people at banks and explaining to them how crypto can be used–specifically XRP–can be used to solve a real problem, not to circumvent regulation,” he said.

“[…]Once people understand that, they very quickly become disarmed–[‘crypto’] is no longer a bad word.”

Criticisms of over-centralization

However, there is still some uneasiness about the amount of control that Ripple, as a company, has over the XRP supply. Finland-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinmotion said in a blog post earlier this month after making the decision to delist XRP that “What differentiates XRP from cryptocurrencies is that it is not based on blockchain, it is not mined and it is heavily centralized.”

In addition to Ripple Labs’ XRP holdings, it is also estimated that Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb holds massive amounts of the cryptocurrency: a recent analysis by blockchain monitor Whale Alert suggests that Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb sold off more than one billion XRP between 2014 and 2019.

Indeed, blockchain monitor Whale Alert estimated on February 6th that McCaleb still holds another 4.7 billion XRP, or 5% of the total supply of XRP–a sum that is currently worth more than one billion U.S. dollars.

However, it is important to note that XRP is not used on all of Ripple’s payment networks, meaning that the price of XRP does not necessarily have an effect on each of the payment networks. Even RippleNet, which uses XRP to send real-time payments, transfers assets in-and-out of XRP almost instantaneously, meaning that fluctuations in the price of XRP do not have a major effect on the value of payments sent through the network.

Expanding into “unbanked” markets

Despite the criticim, however, Ripple is still growing.

Indeed, the company and Garlinghouse also seem to be utlizing this hands-on, compliance-focused approach to reach into some of the more remote corners of the world–” unbanked” regions that lack financial infrastructure: a statement on the company’s website says that “with RippleNet, banks can expand payment offerings into new markets that are otherwise difficult or expensive to reach.”

In particular, Ripple seems to have its eye on the APAC region: in a blog post entitled “How to Tap Rapid Growth in Asia-Pacific Remittances,” Pegah Soltani, who works in Product Marketing at Ripple, wrote that “it’s important to have global reach with locally relevant service offerings.”

The post ends with a call-to-action for payments companies to contact Ripple in order to use “RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) as an alternative to traditional pre-funding” as a possible liquidity solution and ODL uses the digital asset XRP as a real-time liquidity bridge between the sending and receiving currencies.”

A number of payments providers and banks have already begun partnering with Ripple throughout the APAC region, including SBI Remit in Thailand, the Siam Commercial Bank, as well as MoneyGram and SendFriend in the Philippines.

Finance Magnates reached out to Ripple for commentary but did not hear back before press time.","And then there were four…

The American presidential race has picked up speed. Within the last several days, three democratic candidates have suspended their campaigns, and with so many primary races happening today, “Super Tuesday”, it will undoubtedly be more clear by the end of the week who will be running against the incumbent President, Donald Trump: as of the morning of March 3rd, there were still four candidates in the democratic presidential race: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Mike Bloomberg.

While the political conversation in the United States has centered mostly around social welfare issues, there has been some talk over the past several weeks about how each of the candidates could potentially affect the cryptocurrency and fintech industries.

The United States has long been lagging when it comes to creating proper legislation for cryptocurrency. Even after the dawn of Libra, which seemed to awaken the attention of the federal government in a serious way for the first time, the United States remains a patchwork of regulatory jurisdictions.

At a federal level, the slow pace of legislative action in the United States has caused various government bodies to pick and choose from existing laws to cover the crypto industry–with mixed results.

Additionally, there has been some hostility directed toward crypto from the current commander-in-chief himself: last year, prompted by the launch of Libra, President Donald Trump tweeted that “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” adding that “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.”

…and International. We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019

In other words, there’s a lot of room for improvement when it comes to the regulatory situation surrounding the cryptocurrency industry in the United States; then again, it’s also possible that the situation could worsen.

What have each of the remaining US presidential candidates said or done that may be relevant to the way their administrations will treat cryptocurrency? And what will the future look like if things stay the way they are right now?

Bernie Sanders: the darling of the tech industry? Depends who you ask

While most of the candidates have not spoken about cryptocurrency directly, we can infer from some of their actions where they might stand on the cryptocurrency industry in the future.

For example, Bernie Sanders also hasn’t spoken directly about cryptocurrency during his campaign.

With his leftist rhetoric–which is considered to be extreme by some members of the American electorate–Sanders can be a rather polarizing figure. Though he hasn’t spoken directly on crypto or tech more generally, the New York Times recently reported that he seems to be feared by the leaders of Silicon Valley.

However, Sanders does seem to be the darling of the tech industry more generally when donations from tech company employees are taken into account–the Guardian reported on March 2nd that Sanders had gotten a collective $726,702 in donations from 5,735 employees of some of the States’ largest tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, Uber, Tesla and SpaceX, Oracle, and Microsoft.

Additionally, there is some consensus in the crypto community that a Sanders presidency could be great for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies–however, this seems to stem out of the belief that some of Sanders’ proposed policies could devalue the United States dollar.

Indeed, when Sanders ran in 2016, Patrick Dugan from the Omni Foundation told Cointelegraph that “Bernie’s plans, more directly than others, will require the monetization of more US debt in order to monetize the Quantitative Easing (QE) for the people in the form of expensive subsidies for healthcare and education.”

“So as the centrist, Wall St. friendly QE would cause that new money to flow into Wall St. assets, the Main St. QE would flow into business revenue as people necessarily spend it, and those who don’t need to spend it, will be able to try and protect the value by buying physical gold, hoarding cash (expecting negative rates to follow), or if they want the full range of financial services that banking provided with the sovereignty of fungible hard money, they will get their money on an open blockchain such as Bitcoin.”

Joe Biden

While former Vice President Joe Biden also hasn’t said anything directly about cryptocurrency, TrustNodes</em floated the idea of Biden as the “Bitcoin Candidate” in an article last July.

Additionally, a political action committee (PAC) that was campaigning for Biden to run for the presidency in 2016 began accepting donations in BTC. At the time, Joseph Schweitzer, the PAC’s director, said in a statement that “this is in keeping with Vice President Biden’s strong support of technology and innovation throughout his career.”

And Biden has been fairly progressive when it comes to technological innovation in the past, particularly when it comes to issues somewhat analogous to the cryptocurrency sector.

For example, Biden commented in 2011 on the internet itself, saying that he views the internet as a neutral force that the world must collaborate on in order to upkeep–seemingly implying that regulation may be necessary.

“The Internet itself is not inherently a force for democracy or oppression, for war or for peace. Like any public square or any platform for commerce, the Internet is neutral,” he said. “But what we do there isn’t neutral. It’s up to us to decide whether and how we will protect it against the dangers that can occur in cyberspace while maintaining the conditions that give rise to its many benefits.“

“[…] So the United States stands behind the current approach which harnesses the best of governments and private sector and civil society to manage the technical evolution of the Internet in real-time,” he said. “This public-private collaboration has kept the Internet up and running all over the world.”

While he doesn’t mention cryptocurrency here, if we replace the word “Internet” with the word “Bitcoin” or “cryptocurrency”, it may be possible to infer that Biden could view something like the cryptocurrency industry or the Bitcoin network as fairly neutral, but in need of regulatory collaboration to prevent crime.

Elizabeth Warren

While the next 24 hours may offer a plot twist, it seems that the trajectory of Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign may be losing steam; as of 10.00 EEST on Tuesday morning, the Senator from Massachusettes hadn’t won a single state, and may eventually drop out of the race.

That being said, Elizabeth Warren has previously demonstrated a degree of healthy skepticism towards crypto in the past. Though she has been somewhat critical of crypto, she also seems to be somewhat eager to understand cryptocurrencies, and to regulate them in a way that protects consumers without damaging their functionality.

Quoted by Forbes, Warren said in 2018 that cryptocurrency was easy to steal and that a lot of small investors had been scammed by ICOs. (She wasn’t exactly wrong.)

“The challenge is how to nurture productive aspects of crypto with protecting consumers,” she said.

Previously, in 2017, Elizabeth Warren called for regulation on crypto in remarks she made to Yahoo! Finance.

“I’m worried about consumers getting hurt,” she said. The cryptocurrency has a history of extreme volatility, but has been on a tear of late, approaching $10,000 per bitcoin.

“It’s American families that end up paying the price when any regulator says we’re more interested in Wall Street,” said Warren. “What I think is that we need a Fed that is engaged in watching where risk builds up in the system. That’s the Fed’s job — that’s not the job of American families.”

Mike Bloomberg

Like Elizabeth Warren, the billionaire and former mayor of New York also hadn’t won any states at press time; he has also spoken openly about his views on cryptocurrencies.

Indeed, in a financial reform plan published last month, Bloomberg advocated for “providing a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.”

Specifically, the proposal said that “cryptocurrencies have become an asset class worth hundreds of billions of dollars, yet regulatory oversight remains fragmented and undeveloped. For all the promise of the blockchain, bitcoin and initial coin offerings, there’s also plenty of hype, fraud and criminal activity.”

Bloomberg also spoke briefly on his views about Bitcoin in 2017 on Bloomberg Markets and Finance, when he said that small businesses would not need to have a Bitcoin strategy “in our lifetime.”

The state of the States

Of course, it’s also possible–and perhaps even likely–that the next president of the United States (and his or her administration) may not take any kind of serious action toward regulating the cryptocurrency industry. This could mean that the crypto industry will continue to operate in the country’s current regulatory conditions.

What does this mean on a practical level? While some states have made the effort to create regulations and licensing procedures for crypto platforms and some of the more niche aspects of the fintech industry, but many (or even most) rely on existing laws that have been stretched to cover crypto.

This is also true of the federal government. The most popular example of this is the application of the Howey Test, which is used to determine whether or not an asset can be deemed as a security, to bring legal action against a number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and some other kinds of token sales.

As such, a number of entities that have been negatively affected by the application of the Howey Test have claimed that the United States government–in particular, that the Securities and Exchange Commission–is guilty of “regulation by enforcement.”

In other words, that the SEC failed to make regulations clear at a stage when the affected parties could have used more guidance to steer clear of sticky legal territory, and that it is instead seeking to clarify its regulations by enforcing them in unprecedented ways.

Indeed, the “regulation by enforcement” argument was recently used against the SEC in two high-profile cases brought against Canada-based encrypted messaging service Kik and Berlin-based encrypted messaging service Telegram, both of which held token sales that broke fundraising records at their respective closing times.

Kik’s counter-filing against the SEC, however, said that the Commission had “engaged in improper ‘regulation by enforcement’ in this nascent area of the law, failed to provide clear guidance and fair notice of its views as to what conduct constitutes a violation of the federal securities laws, and has now adopted an ad hoc legal position that is contrary to judicial precedent and the publicly expressed views of its own high-ranking officials.”

However, in its cases against both Kik and Telegram, the SEC has fired back with claims that the “regulation by enforcement” argument is not valid, even though Telegram alleges that it had “voluntarily engaged” with the SEC seeking guidance to avoid breaking federal securities laws and that the SEC still “failed to provide [guidance] prior to bringing this enforcement action.”

Lawmakers and law enforcement are slowly learning about cryptocurrencies

However, Phil Liu, Chief Legal Officer and Co-Founder of crypto investment platform Arca, pointed out that while there have been a few bumps in the road, and perhaps a general sense of inaction from the government’s part, there have been some positive changes in the way that federal and state governments are interacting with the cryptocurrency industry.

Mr. Liu said that much of this shift stems from the fact that regulators and law-enforcement bodies have become much more familiar with the way that cryptocurrency works. Indeed, Mr. Liu said that the government “understand[s] the risks and technology more.”

As such, the government’s crypto-related law enforcement efforts may have improved. For example, “they know now how to trace transactions once a wallet has been identified to a person. They know the usual scammer techniques and how they target investors so they are able to go after them quicker.”

Additionally, the government is “coordinating responses and actions with foreign counterparts better.”

Mr. Liu sees a shift in the way that regulators are interacting with the industry in another way: “[the government is] also working with innovators to allow innovation to happen within the law, and [has] demonstrated an openness to hearing about how the current laws prevent or hinder innovation.”

There are several examples of this at the federal level–perhaps the most famous one is the series of hearings that both the United States Senate and the House of Congress had regarding Facebook’s Libra project, which was launched in June of 2019.

Is the US government opening its ears to the crypto industry?

While the hearings did seem to result in several pieces of proposed reactionary legislation, including the “Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act” and the “Stablecoins Are Securities Act”, the hearings also helped to open the discussion around the role of cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency platforms in the United States government, perhaps for the first time.

The hearings may have also contributed to later pieces of proposed legislation, including the “Crypto-Currency Act of 2020”, which seeks to define and regulate cryptocurrency more generally in a more progressive and nuanced way.

Additionally, while it has been argued that the SEC may have regulated by enforcement when it comes to cryptocurrency token sales, the Commission has heavily communicated with firms that have made an effort to launch Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

Indeed, while the many delays that each ETF application has faced were certainly frustrating, it can be argued that the delays were evidential of the fact that the SEC was working internally to try and see if there could be a way to get an ETF on the books.

Still, the fact that none of these applications has received approval has led to some dissenting opinions, even within the Commission itself.

Indeed, Commissioner Hester Peirce, also known as ‘Crypto Mom’, said last week after the SEC’s rejection of the Wilshire Phoenix Bitcoin ETF application that the SEC’s “ever-shifting standards” when it comes to BTC-related products and services “impedes innovation in this country and threatens to drive entrepreneurs, and the opportunities they create, to other jurisdictions.”

Can the US’s legislative behemoth move quickly enough for crypto?

However, it can be argued that in order for truly effective regulation in the United States, there may need to be some changes at a structural level.

Speaking about the role of regulation in the US economy in an interview with Finance Magnates last year, Miko Matsumura, General Partner of Gumi Cryptos, said that “Regulators are always trying to do their best. [But] for example, if you take a regulatory body like the US SEC, they’re about 1% of the size of Goldman Sachs–and they have to regulate Goldman Sachs. That’s a big job.”

In fact, “it’s too much,” he said. “The people I’ve spoken to at the SEC are incredibly bright and really, really good at their jobs, but there just aren’t enough of them. There are too few people working on it, and it’s too hard–and obviously, so-called innovators–their full-time job is to skirt around the edges and sort of chip away.”

In other words, the SEC and other regulatory bodies may already be so saddled with regulating the “mainstream” financial industry that cryptocurrency could continue to fall to the wayside, at least until it becomes “mainstream” enough to become a real “concern” for the SEC and other regulatory and law-enforcement bodies.

But this presents a sort of Catch-22: crypto mya never truly reach “mainstream” status in the US without regulatory support from these entities; if it does, it may be through the support of foreign entities, which the US government is unlikely to be too enthusiastic about.

Still, it seems as though the regulatory processes in the United States are far outpaced by those in smaller, more agile nations: jurisdictions like Switzerland, Japan, Malta, Gibraltar, and other places in the EU and Asia seem to be leading the way forward. The US–whoever its president will be–may have no choice but to eventually follow.","The 2019 crypto derivatives market saw a host of developments across the board as several trading avenues opened across the globe. Retail brokerage giants like BitMEX and OKEx commanded much of the trading volume throughout the year. However, the latter part of 2019 saw the emergence of new cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges looking to gain a share of the market. These new participants have to overcome a number of issues, especially related to unplanned liquidation problems.

With margin collateral limits significantly smaller than with mainstream derivatives, a sudden price move — which is common for such a highly volatile industry, can see massive liquidation of a trader’s position faster than they can move capital out of the losing position.

Liquidity and price discovery mechanisms also plague the market as a significant portion of one exchange’s index price might be based on another platform. If there is a large liquidity variance between both services, any trading discrepancy in one platform can lead to a cascade of forced liquidations in the other as seen during the Bitstamp Bitcoin flash crash of May 2019, or the recent XRP wick on BitMEX, which enraged many traders.

Limits of leverage for crypto derivatives trading also remains an issue with some jurisdictions working towards imposing strict guidelines for margin trading. In places like the U.K., regulators are reportedly considering a blanket ban on cryptocurrency derivatives, citing risks to retail investors.

With the Bitcoin (BTC) halving in mid-2020 expected to generate renewed hype in the broader crypto market, some analysts predict that both spot and derivatives crypto market will experience even greater trading volumes. Analysts are also pointing towards the emergence of crypto options trading as another avenue for renewed interest in virtual currency-based derivatives.

2020 the Year of Crypto Derivatives

In its 2019 crypto derivatives trading report, cryptocurrency analytics firm TokenInsight revealed a massive increase in the global virtual currency derivatives trading market. Some important takeaways from the report include:

Total crypto derivatives trading on exchanges topped $3 trillion in 2019 with an average daily trading volume of about $8.5 billion.

The market also rose from 10 percent of the spot trading market volume to one-fifth (20 percent).

Three major exchanges —BitMEX, OKEx, and Huobi DM cornered the majority of the crypto derivatives trading activity, accounting for over 85 percent of the total market trading volume.

They also reported that they expect the crypto derivatives market in 2020 will maintain similar growth trends experienced in Q3 2019. Trading volume for cryptocurrency derivatives in the second half of 2019 almost doubled the figures recorded for the first half of the year.

Looking ahead to 2020, TokenInsight’s predicted forecast is that the crypto derivatives market will outstrip the spot trading scene by as much as 100 percent. With the influx of more virtual currency derivatives instruments, some commentators are already tipping 2020 to be the year when the crypto derivatives scene takes center stage.

Evaluating Exchanges

With the positive sentiments surrounding the crypto derivatives scene, traders need to think carefully about the exchanges they chose for their crypto derivatives activities. Despite the abundance of options, the (still) largely unregulated nature of the retail cryptocurrency derivatives trading scene opens up possibilities for untrustworthy actors in the brokerage space.

Trading fees should form a major part of the consideration when deciding upon an exchange. Some platforms offer misleading information about their trading fees, hiding the true costs of trading within the fine print. These exchanges usually do so by highlighting their low maker/taker fees while not prominently displaying their spreads.

Instead traders should look for exchanges that display spreads and commission fees. Without these vital pieces of information, determining actual trading costs can be difficult.

Another important consideration is the amount of information provided by exchanges about their platform tools and how they relate to the market. Given the possibility for forced liquidations, responsible crypto derivatives exchanges should make it easy for retail traders to set up stop losses when entering a new position.

Making it easy to trigger stops is a major consideration. Select an exchange that operates similarly to traditional exchanges, where orders are rejected if their price is beyond +/- 10% of last price or +/- 15% mark price. Market order execution price should also be able to be capped by such range to avoid any unexpected slippage, in addition to order quantity limits on single orders, which prevent potential mistakes of large traders from wiping out the entire order book.

With deposits and withdrawals being made in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin plus the absence of fiat support, vast amounts of know your customer (KYC) details shouldn’t be required by the exchanges, having to provide identifying information when not required raises potential red flags tied to privacy concerns.

Multiple Trading Options Including Healthy Leverage

The ability to go long or short on any derivatives instrument plus the presence of healthy margin trading provisions is also another factor to be considered when choosing a crypto derivatives exchange. Limited trading options usually points to crypto derivatives exchanges that are intent on trading against their customers.

Such practices often lead to massive liquidations of customer positions while the platform maintains a healthy bottom-line.

Leverage limits for crypto derivatives trading continue to be a subject for debate within the cryptocurrency trading space. Critics say high leverage ratios open inexperienced traders to the potential for massive losses.

However, responsible crypto derivatives brokers help their customers manage the risks of margin trading by providing adequate protection. Crypto derivatives exchanges should offer risk limits to mitigate such occurrences. One such protective protocols some exchanges use is traders who wish to open larger positions must reduce their leverage ratio while paying a bigger margin sum.

2020 promises to be a busy year for crypto derivatives trading. Using these points listed above, retail traders may be able to choose the best platforms to help them take advantage of the opportunities coming throughout the year.

About the Author

By Jack Tao, CEO of Phemex, an ex-Morgan Stanley executive who with eight former colleagues have built a crypto derivatives trading platform that is on par with those experienced at big investment banks.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has finally picked one out of the thousands of cryptocurrencies in existance and declared that it is the best. And it's not Bitcoin.

It's Dogecoin.

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was invented as a joke by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus—but it took on a life of its own. With the Japanese dog breed Shiba Inu as its mascot and an entire language built around the coin, ""wow, such coin, many profit,"" it developed a cult following.

It's not the first time Musk has showed his love for Dogecoin. He previously changed his Twitter bio to reflect that he was the CEO of Dogecoin and once tweeted ""throw a dogecoin to ur witcher"" before deleting it shortly after.

Today, he first tweeted that ""Dogs rock,"" with an image of a dog celebrating its birthday without any concept of numbers. Underneath it he added that dogs ""have the best coin.""

They have the best coin — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 3, 2020

Musk has spoken about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency too but in peculiar ways. He once tweeted, ""Cryptocurrency is my safe word,"" before later adding that, ""Bitcoin is not my safe word.""

He has also spoken about Bitcoin too, saying that it could be a replacement for cash in terms of enabling illegal activity. But that he doesn't see it becoming the main method of payment around the world. Perhaps that role is reserved for his favorite cryptocurrency. Wow.","Uphold is hoping to prevent its customers from being audited by reporting their crypto trades as property trades – not income, as many exchanges have done in the past.

The platform, which provides trading in crypto, fiat currencies and assets like metals, is partnering with TaxBit to provide customers with a tax liability dashboard on its user portal, and intends to help customers file more accurate tax returns, streamlining what has to date been an opaque process for crypto investors.

Michelle O’Conner, Uphold’s vice-president of marketing and communication, told CoinDesk the move is part of an effort to make her company more accessible for customers by simplifying the tax-filing process.

“We’ll provide real-time liabilities, real-time information, what your liability will be when making a trade, how to reduce your liability,” O’Connor said.

While Uphold is working with TaxBit, O’Connor said her company would not be providing any tax advice itself. Rather, Uphold will defer any actual questions or advice to TaxBit, which has certified public accountants on retainer.

Essentially, Uphold and TaxBit intend to file 1099-B forms, which are typically used for investments and report cost-basis, rather than the 1099-K forms some exchanges previously filed for their customers.

“This tax form was kind of a spur-of-the-moment reaction to something, but there was never any clear IRS guidance that that was the correct form,” said TaxBit co-founder Austin Woodward.

The 1099-K reports income and is used by merchants. Because exchanges were filing crypto transactions as income, they effectively said their customers’ assets had greater value than in reality (or what the customers were reporting directly), resulting in some customers being audited and others receiving warning letters from the agency.

Filing property

Uphold’s CEO, J.P. Theriot, is one of the individuals who received an audit from the Internal Revenue Service due to inaccurate numbers being reported from his crypto holdings.

“Our CEO actually received a letter from the IRS basically saying ‘you owe an absurd amount of money’ from the 2016 tax season, and it was totally inaccurate,” O’Connor said. TaxBit helped resolve the situation.

TaxBit has been communicating with the IRS as part of an effort to reduce these audits, Woodward said. The company claims to have helped resolve “hundreds of 1099-K audits,” helping the agency accept the 1099-B as a more relevant form in the proces.

The B form lists all transactions, the numbers when buying or selling and the gain (or loss), Woodward said. The platform will file this form to the IRS, while the taxpayer will file the corresponding 8949 form.

“They’re intended for property transactions. The IRS defines property as a capital asset which encompasses equity, property [and crypto assets],” he said.

Woodward said he doesn’t yet know what the IRS might do for past years, given that there are likely scores more 1099-K forms that present individuals’ crypto holdings as much higher than they might be in reality. The agency is operating on a roughly two-year lag when it comes to audits, meaning individuals were audited in 2019 for their 2017 tax returns.

However, the agency is working to better understand how to treat crypto, he said.

“They’re investing heavily, they’re becoming more educated and informed,” Woodward said, referencing a CoinDesk investigation that found the agency spent $4.1 million on blockchain forensics provider Chainalysis, of which $3.6 million came in the last two years alone."
2020-03-04,"San Francisco (CNN Business) India's top court struck down a ban on cryptocurrency trading by the country's central bank, ending a nearly two-year legal battle to get the virtual currencies reinstated in the country.

The Supreme Court of India on Wednesday overturned a 2018 ruling by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which prohibited Indian banks from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges over ""concerns of consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering, among others.""

The central bank's ban came after months of scrutiny of digital currencies by financial regulators as well as the government, which compared them to ""Ponzi schemes"" and threatened to impose harsh regulations. The RBI gave Indian banks three months to sever ties with all entities dealing in virtual currencies.

The inability to use Indian banks for their operations crippled the country's exchanges that dealt in currencies such as bitcoin, ripple and ethereum, forcing many of them to shut down operations. Despite its population and online presence , India only accounted for around 3% of the global cryptocurrency market before the ban, according to estimates by crypto entrepreneur Sathvik Vishwanath.

But growing interest in virtual currencies meant there was ""tremendous scope going forward,"" Vishwanath, cofounder and CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin, told CNN two months before the ban.","As winter gives way to spring in India, the country’s crypto community, too, has got a fresh lease of life.

Yesterday (March 4), India’s supreme court overturned an April 2018 central bank order barring banks from providing services to cryptocompanies. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had, in its diktat, assumed that virtual currencies posed a systemic risk to the banking system. This was purely facetious.

Now with the apex court quashing the ban, the cryptocommunity hopes that the Indian government will not take another stab at them by legislating around the verdict. Instead policymakers should take a cue from central banks across the world.

The Chinese model

In 2019, China announced plans to launch a sovereign cryptocurrency—the crypto renminbi or, to refer to it by its technical term, the DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment). The move was prompted by the need to develop an alternative to the US dollar as a reserve currency. In the light of China’s trade war with the US, a sovereign cryptocurrency would help challenge the US’ economic dominance.

To be sure, cryptocurrencies in China are regulated. Even so, it is the thriving heart of the crypto ecosystem as the government is pushing multiple blockchain projects, funds and local crypto champions.

In parallel, China could find synergies between its proposed crypto renminbi and the multi-billion-dollar One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative. The major infrastructure project, which involves building a network of roadways, railways, and ports across the globe, is also an opportunity to internationalise the usage of the renminbi. A crypto renminbi will speed up this process.

The current geopolitical climate is also fertile ground for nations such as Iran and Russia to double down on their cryptocurrency efforts.

Even Bank of England governor Mark Carney has called for a digital Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC), similar to Facebook’s Libra cryptocoin, as an alternative to the dollar.

Cryptocommunity’s wish list

To stay relevant amid the global interest, India needs to get its act together. The 2018 RBI order had pushed the country’s cryptocommunity a step back. Once fastest-growing exchanges like Unocoin, and Zebpay have either shut down or moved their operations overseas.

Despite the regulatory ambiguity, there is a fair bit of home-grown talent that served the global crypto market in the past two years. Two of the largest DeFi (distributed finance) players in the world, Instadapp and Nuo, are from India. Binance, a leading Chinese global exchange, recently acquired the Indian cryptobourse Wazir-X.

To further nurture this talent, the following regulatory steps would be welcomed by the Indian cryptocommunity.

Cryptocurrency advisory council: The government should set up an advisory council that will guide future policy on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Besides regulators and lawmakers, the council should include representatives from national and international crypto operators. It can work with leading players in the cryptocommunity to jointly police the ecosystem and minimise “bad-actor” use cases. In parallel, the government should champion a global regulatory body for cryptocurrencies, working with other central banks and enforcement agencies.

Sandbox facility: Most national regulators now have sandboxes that facilitate testing of ideas for R&D and instructional purposes. A sandbox is a virtual, isolated space where untested software can be run securely. The RBI’s sandbox explicitly excludes cryptocurrencies, which should be reviewed. A sandbox would spur the development of corporate cryptocurrencies like Facebook’s Libra or JP Morgan’s proposed coin for payments and settlements. There is no reason why India’s leading companies cannot launch such “network coins.” In China, payment majors such as Ant Financial (a major stakeholder in Paytm) are collaborating with regional and local governments to design such payment technology and lending infrastructure.

Crypto rupee: A sovereign cryptocurrency in India would be an interesting proposition for the central bank. With a crypto rupee, the central bank could directly control the supply of cash. Another advantage would be the ease with which this money can be tracked and traced across bordeers for perpetuity on the blockchain. This will also significantly eliminate the problem of the parallel economy. A crypto rupee will have many benefits to specific sectors, such as payments, remittances and providing credit to small and medium enterprises.

State investments in crypto: Central banks around the world are stockpiling gold, especially in a post-Covid-19 scenario, and it will be a surprise if they are not adding to their bitcoin holdings as well, as Ryan Selkis of Messari, a research firm, points out. It impossible to ignore bitcoin as an asset class. It has returned a whopping 2,332,803% over 2010-2019. Compare that to the 189% returns of the S&P 500 and the 19% returns that gold has given over the same timeframe. In a scenario of anaemic growth, and falling income from tax revenues, India’s sovereign wealth fund should consider investing in bitcoins.

Consider this upside scenario. If the RBI were to slowly accumulate even $1 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, it would likely drive up the price of bitcoin ten-fold, to around $100,000 as a major nation like India would now be legitimising bitcoin as an asset class. The $10 billion in bitcoin holdings, with some prudent yield-harvesting, would take care of around 10% of India’s outstanding fiscal deficit for the year 2019. It would also be equal to one-sixth of the overall defence budget outlay for the year and would take care of most of the education budget for 2019.

Given that bitcoin is here to stay, the supreme court judgment is an opportunity to take a progressive stance in a nascent sector that has transformational potential. It is high time our top policy makers wake up and smell the crypto.

We welcome your comments at ideas.india@qz.com.","The decision by India’s Supreme Court to lift the central bank’s ban on cryptocurrency trading could soon translate into notable growth in trading volumes, according to cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.

India’s Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) order dated April 6, 2018, which prohibited banks from providing services to entities dealing with cryptocurrencies.

The top court called RBI’s ban unconstitutional, bringing cheer to the crypto market community.

Put simply, Indian traders will now be able to directly deposit Indian rupee (INR) from bank accounts to crypto exchanges. As a result, it will be more convenient for users to cash in and cash out of their holdings.

“This is the first step towards embracing cryptocurrency in India, which has the potential of becoming one of the largest crypto markets.” Ashish Singhal, chief executive of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.co, told CoinDesk.

India was doing very well in terms of trading volumes, contributing about $50 million to $60 million per day before the RBI ban, according to Singhal.

“In India, a huge damage was done due to the lack of awareness and RBI’s decision,” said Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO at online crypto banking platform Cashaa.

Volumes subsequently dipped after the central bank issued banking restrictions and commercial banks responded by advising account holders not to engage in cryptocurrency transactions.

For instance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of the largest lenders in India, has diligently sent multiple notification emails to account holders in the last two years warning against the use of credit cards for cryptocurrency exchanges.

“In line with the instructions issued by RBI, we also wish to advise you that, if transactions relating to any kind of virtual currencies are witnessed on your Kotak Credit Card, the Bank shall be constrained to block your Credit Card without any further intimation,” the email reads.

As a result, Indians crypto traders were forced to use peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms, which allow direct transfer of cryptocurrencies into the individual accounts without the intervention of any financial institution or government authority. However, liquidating cryptocurrency holdings is quite difficult when dealing with P2P platforms.

Also, RBI’s decision was widely misinterpreted as legal ruling deeming cryptocurrency trading as an unlawful activity.

With the Supreme Court’s latest ruling, the situation is widely expected to change for the good.

“Crypto exchanges including WazirX will now be able to enable banking channels for fiat deposit and withdrawals,” said Nischal Shetty, founder & CEO of Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, which was recently acquired by Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume.

Shetty expects volumes on Indian cryptocurrency exchanges to grow by 10 times in the near future.

CoinSwitch’s Ashish Singhal anticipates average daily volume rising as high as $50 million to $60 million – the level seen before the RBI ban – and may surpass that level.

A sharp rise in volumes cannot be ruled out in India, a country with a population of over 1 billion. The Supreme Court judgment could help erase the misconception that cryptocurrencies are illegal and may draw more investors to the market.

“The clarity that the judgment has brought, will help crypto adoption as a whole and which in tune will see a spike in volume,” said CoinDCX Chief Executive Sumit Gupta. CoinDCX has actively voiced its thoughts on behalf of India’s crypto community on the RBI ban over the last two years and was quick to allow bank transfers following the ruling.

Focus on compliance

“The Supreme Court decision to lift the bank is a forthcoming step and cryptocurrency exchanges should now start focusing on deploying stronger know-your-client (KYC), user data privacy, and AML policies,” according to Arpit Ratan, co-founder of RegTech startup Signzy.

Indeed, that would help build trust and reduce risks of cryptocurrency transactions being exploited for illegal activities, such as crimes, money laundering and tax evasions.

Moreover, Indian lenders serving cryptocurrency entities will now face similar which banks in other, developed countries such as Japan, Europe, and the U.S. are facing.

“Cashaa, with its huge crypto-focused customer base, can provide a powerful system that will be very helpful for RBI to understand the [anti-money laundering] issues coming due to onboarding crypto companies is needed,” said Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO of Cashaa.

Premature optimism?

The general consensus is the Supreme Court’s ruling would open a path to favorable regulations towards protecting all stakeholders, including companies, customers and users.

However, despite the top court’s decision, the government could still ban cryptocurrencies.

“There’s still a bill that the Parliament has to discuss. It has changed shapes and forms but hopefully this will be the framework for how cryptocurrency is traded in the country,” said Prashant Swaminathan, founder and CEO of Tandem, a peer-to-peer bitcoin (BTC) trading platform told Mint, an Indian financial daily newspaper.

The Indian government had submitted a draft crypto bill named entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currencies” to the Supreme Court in August 2019, seeking to ban the use of cryptocurrency as legal tender or currency and prohibit mining, buying, holding, selling, dealing in, issuance, disposal or use of cryptocurrency.

However, the government did not introduce the draft bill in the winter session of the parliament held between Nov. 18 and Dec. 13.","BitGo, one of the largest and oldest custodians for digital assets, is joining the fast-growing business of lending out bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to big investors. The Palo Alto-based company announced Thursday it is now offering institutional digital asset lending services.

Founded in 2013 by CEO Mike Belshe, BitGo started testing the new service a few months ago to big investors and has already racked up about $150 million in open loans, according to Nick Carmi, a former Deutsche Bank executive who is overseeing the effort as BitGo’s head of financial services. The new service is initially targeting BitGo’s existing custody clients, the company said in a statement.

BitGo is currently lending bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and stablecoins, Carmi said in an interview. The company also will lend out government-issued currencies including U.S. dollars to investors who post cryptocurrencies as collateral.

With big banks still mostly eschewing the 11-year-old digital-asset industry, a new breed of lenders is stepping into the void to meet the demand, partly from investors seeking to amplify returns on their cryptocurrency bets, through the use of leverage.

The business model of cryptocurrency lenders works much like that of traditional banks: Take in assets from depositors, pay them interest and then make loans at a higher interest rate. The lender can seize the collateral to pay off the loan if the borrower defaults.

“I’m running a matched spread and making a profit on that,” Carmi said. “This is no different from the way banks do it.”

BitGo’s new push comes as cryptocurrency lenders have reported runaway growth compared with traditional banks.

New York-based Genesis Trading, owned by the crypto-focused investment firm Digital Currency Group, said in January that its lending book swelled by 21 percent in the fourth quarter alone to $545 million, driven by demand from big investors as well as aggregators of smaller loans in Asia and Europe. Such growth was more than 10 times the pace at New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, where loan balances increased by 2 percent – roughly in line with the broader economy’s expansion.

Digital Currency Group, which owns CoinDesk, is an investor in BitGo. Other backers include the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs and crypto-focused investor Galaxy Digital Ventures, led by the former hedge-fund executive and Goldman partner Mike Novogratz.

So far, Carmi said, the vast majority of BitGo’s loans are denominated in bitcoin — similar to the oldest cryptocurrency’s dominance in digital-asset markets.

According to BitGo’s website, Belshe started the company after serving in the early 2010s as a custodian for himself and other tech investors by securing digital coins on an offline laptop hidden beneath his couch. In an industry fraught with reports of scammers, hacks and regulatory missteps, cryptocurrency asset safekeeping has become a key priority for big investors willing to stomach the risks in exchange for outsize profits from betting on the notoriously volatile market.

Bitcoin prices nearly doubled in 2019 and are up 22 percent so far this year. Such performance contrasts with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the benchmark for large U.S. stocks, which has fallen 4.3 percent in 2020 amid coronavirus fears after climbing 29 percent last year.

Last month, BitGo announced plans to buy the two-year-old, blockchain-focused startup Harbor, best known for its failed effort in 2019 to tokenize $20 million of shares in a South Carolina high-rise building.","Source: iStock/Adventure and lifestyle images and video footage

XRP, the token associated with the California-based fintech firm Ripple, is down 1% today, while other major coins dropped 1%-4% today, despite good news from India.

At pixel time (13:00 UTC), XRP trades at c. USD 0.233 and is also down 4.9% in a week, increasing its monthly losses to 7.5%. The price is down 25% in a year.

Today’s trading came after Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to Twitter yesterday to once again slam Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), saying that mining of proof-of-work cryptoassets like these is “a massive waste” and that there is “no incentive to take responsibility for the carbon footprint.”

Energy consumption for BTC and ETH mining is a massive waste and there’s no incentive to take responsibility for th… https://t.co/nD1djdaNSl — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse)

Shortly after, however, feedback started to pour in from the Bitcoin community, with the Bitcoin evangelist at Kraken, Pierre Rochard, responding sarcastically that “XRP wastes far more electricity than BTC, if you look up the definition of waste.”

Interestingly, yesterday’s comments from Garlinghouse is far from the first time the CEO has belittled competitors and criticized Bitcoin, having previously said things like “bitcoin is really controlled by China” and that “99% of cryptos probably goes to zero.”

The current price moves for XRP also comes after it was reported last weekend that Brad Garlinghouse has admitted his company would be unprofitable without the monthly XRP sales.

The monthly selling of XRP in the market has frequently been criticized in the community and is believed to be a major reason for why XRP is still down by more than 90% from its all-time high in early 2018. However, there is hope for the situation to improve after Ripple announced in January that it had slashed its XRP sales after raising USD 200 million in new funding.","News What’s Next for Facebook’s Crypto?

Facebook is in the process of rethinking its Libra crypto-token, after meeting with regulatory hurdles. The new digital asset may do away with the Libra moniker, instead offering virtual coins strictly representing fiat currencies.

Libra Association Continues with Mission to Launch Wallet, Digital Payment Tools

The Libra Association will be preserved, but Facebook may do away with the plan of creating a new crypto coin. The Information reported the social media giant may be giving up on its plans of disrupting the global financial system.

Initially, Facebook’s crypto launch was scheduled for the early months of 2020. But responses from several central banks suggested Libra may not have an easy time satisfying all regulatory requirements.

Facebook, cited by The Verge, claims it did not entirely scrap the plans to launch a Libra crypto token.

“Reporting that Facebook does not intend to offer the Libra currency in its Calibra wallet is entirely incorrect. Facebook remains fully committed to the project,” a Facebook spokesperson said.

The Calibra wallet, the main carrier of the upcoming digital asset, will have its launch in October, instead of mid-year, the report stated. But the wallet will be expanded to contain versions of fiat currencies, with the potential to carry the Libra token.

“The Libra Association has not altered its goal of building a regulatory compliant global payment network, and the basic design principles that support that goal have not been changed nor has the potential for this network to foster future innovation,” said Dante Disparte, head of Policy and Communications at the Libra Association, cited by the BBC.

The Libra Association recently tweeted its intention to revolutionize the global payment system with direct transfers from Facebook chat and WhatsApp.

You can message friends anywhere in the world today with just your phone. We want you to be able to do the same with payments, instantly, securely, and at low cost. Let’s make that happen. https://t.co/U76K4IckjJ#FinancialInclusion #LibraAssoc — Libra (@Libra_) February 24, 2020

Calibra Wallet Delayed Until October

However, the mention of Libra as a stablecoin has not achieved a positive reaction from central banks and other regulators. Fears remain the crypto-asset would lead to channels to move funds without sufficient scrutiny. Additionally, Libra was seen as undermining national monetary sovereignty, leading to artificial dollarization.

The Libra token has received criticism from both official organizations and the crypto community. While launching a mainstream crypto coin is viewed as a positive development, critics also see the chance to control and block funds, essentially making Libra another highly controlled asset.

The announcement of Libra in the summer of 2019 pushed multiple central banks to explore CBDCs or centrally-backed digital assets. Hypothetically, those assets would offer the speed and low cost of cryptos but derive their value from the central bank’s monetary policy.

To report cryptocurrency holdings, taxpayers should name the assets they hold (such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, etc.) as well as the date of acquisition, the amount owned on the last day of the tax period, and the value of the holdings in Ukraine’s national currency (the hryvnia) according to the exchange rate on the last day of the tax period.

Ukraine has recently made a series of moves aimed at clarifying the rules around cryptocurrency. In February, the country’s Ministry of Digital Transformation made the surprisingly tech-savvy announcement that it was not planning to regulate cryptocurrency mining since it’s already governed by the rules of the blockchain protocol.

2020-03-05,"Bitcoin Legal in India: Exchanges Resume INR Banking Service After Supreme Court Verdict Allows Cryptocurrency

Indian cryptocurrency exchanges are bringing back banking support after the Supreme Court of India struck down the banking ban on the crypto industry. News.Bitcoin.com talked to several crypto exchange executives to find out the effects of the supreme court ruling and what their exchanges plan to offer users now that the banking ban has been removed.

Also read: Indian Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Cryptocurrency — RBI Ban Lifted

Supreme Court Verdict on Cryptocurrency

After almost two years, the Indian crypto community finally won the battle against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and crypto enthusiasts are celebrating worldwide. The Supreme Court of India passed judgment on Wednesday striking down the central bank’s April 2018 circular which bans regulated financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. The court held that the RBI circular is unconstitutional, as news.Bitcoin.com reported.

Following the judgment, the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom), a major trade association of Indian Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing industry, tweeted:

We welcome the supreme court’s decision to lift RBI’s ban on trading in cryptocurrency. We believe that banning tech is not the solution, a risk-based framework must be developed to regulate and monitor cryptocurrencies and tokens.

Indian Parliament Member Dr. Subramanian Swamy has been keeping up with the crypto vs. RBI case. Referring to the supreme court (SC) verdict on cryptocurrency, he tweeted on March 4: “SC allows cryptocurrency trading, cancels RBI’s 2018 circular.” Responding to a question of whether cryptocurrency could lead to “any black money or corruption where babus and netas start using crypto instead of currency notes,” he wrote:

If it is unstoppable then develop software to regulate it. Blanket ban is useless.

Dr. Swamy said in December that “Cryptocurrency is inevitable.” The lawmaker chaired a conference at the UN India’s headquarters the same month which discussed issues surrounding cryptocurrency in the country. Both the government and the RBI have confirmed that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are legal in India.

Crypto Exchange CEOs Share Their Thoughts

After the news of the supreme court lifting the RBI ban broke, social media was flooded with victorious comments. Nischal Shetty, CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx who has been spearheading the “#Indiawantscrypto” social medial campaign, views the ruling as a great victory. “#Indiawantscrypto is a success after 489 days. Overall a great sentiment for crypto globally and for Indian crypto ecosystem,” he told news.Bitcoin.com, elaborating:

Today’s a historic day for the entire Indian crypto ecosystem. This positive judgement will open doors to massive crypto adoption in India. It proves that we can now innovate, and the entire country can participate in the blockchain revolution.

He added: “With over 1 billion population, the Indian market is a sleeping giant. I’m confident that this judgment will have positive impact on the global crypto ecosystem. This will lead to more startups in crypto in India. Hundreds of startups will be created. VC investment will activate in the sector. More jobs.”

Kunal Barchha cofounded crypto exchange Coinrecoil, the first company to challenge the RBI ban in court. However, they withdrew their writ petition in August last year due to financial burden. He told news.Bitcoin.com on Wednesday: “We do plan to launch the exchange but the legal battle has put us in stress — financially. We had a couple of investors before two years that backed off after the circular. We are aggressively getting in touch with them and new investors for fundraising.”

Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of crypto exchange Unocoin, said to news.Bitcoin.com:

The 22 month long wait to get what the crypto industry was already eligible for is now over. This marks an important milestone both in India and globally and helps in bringing positive perspective towards the crypto trading activity which became unclear during the wait.

Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Indian crypto exchange Giottus, shared with news.Bitcoin.com:

Big win for the crypto community in India. Landmark judgment for the crypto-enthusiasts. This will bring back lot of enthusiasm among customers and help India become a forerunner in cryptocurrency space.

Gaurav Dahake, CEO of crypto exchange Bitbns, commented: “We are quite excited about the ban lift, which is a much-awaited relief for us and the entire crypto community. It’s such a morale boost and will definitely help us bring back the high-volume traders who were concerned about the tips involved in our P2P transaction system, and have been unable to transact small amounts. We are happy that they finally have a resolution.”

INR Banking Returns to Crypto Exchanges in India

Following the supreme court order, cryptocurrency exchanges in India rushed to re-integrate banking solutions and bring back INR support through bank accounts. Unocoin’s Vishwanath said “We would spring back to business,” adding that his exchange launched a lending platform on Wednesday. Unocoin announced that INR deposits and withdrawals would resume at 11:30 a.m. (Indian Standard Time) on Thursday.

Wazirx’s Shetty confirmed: “we’re working on the banking integration and plan to get it out soon. Indians will be able to directly deposit and withdraw INR into their Wazirx wallet very soon.” As for his popular peer-to-peer (P2P) platform, he noted, “We’ll continue P2P and gauge the interest of the users.” Wazirx then announced Thursday that INR deposits are now live on its exchange.

Giottus’ Subburaj clarified: “We have already rolled out our solution for processing INR deposit and withdrawals instantly for customers. We are also in talks with array of banks to ensure back up and ease of transferring INR for customers. Proper regulations from the government of India should be coming soon.” For three days starting March 4, Giottus is offering 0% INR deposit and withdraw fees and 0% trading fees. The exchange claims to process INR withdrawals within 10 mins or the user gets 10 free XRP. “Big win for the crypto community, let us celebrate now,” the exchange declared.

Meanwhile, U.K.-based banking platform Cashaa has been providing INR services to Indian users since October last year. The platform started offering fee-free deposits and withdrawals in the beginning of March. “In India, huge damage was done due to a lack of crypto awareness and RBI decision which is now reversed by the Supreme Court of India,” CEO Kumar Gaurav described. “But banking crypto companies will also bring similar risks which banks in other developed countries such as Japan, Europe and the USA are facing. Cashaa’s goal was always to create a hassle-free banking experience for the crypto community.”

The ruling quashed an April 2018 order by the country's central bank that prohibited banks and financial institutions from providing ""any service in relation to virtual currencies"".

Bitcoin's value rose by around 5 per cent following Wednesday's verdict and has since returned above $9,000 for the first time since last month.

Other cryptocurrencies also received a boost, with ether (Ethereum), XRP (Ripple) and Bitcoin Cash all surging 4-7 per cent in price.

Cryptocurrency businesses and exchanges in the country welcomed the decision, despite some suffering difficulties as a result of their infrastructure being overwhelmed by a sudden increase in demand for their services.

Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, described the reversal of the ban as a ""historic day, not just for the crypto community, but for the entire country"".

Mr Gupta's company was one of four cryptocurrency exchanges in the country that petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the two-year ban.

""The removal of the ban by the Supreme Court is going to open new opportunities for India in terms of investments, economic growth, financial inclusion, and market maturation,"" he said.

""We have always seen crypto as a potential to unlock India’s dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy and remain committed to carrying out the hard work which is necessary to make this dream come true.""

""Very rarely do we, as a nation, get an opportunity to participate in revolutionary technology"".","Plaintiffs claim the ruling proves that RBI failed to show that any harm caused to banks due to crypto trading

Startups expect more balanced regulations from the government after the clarity from the court

“The petitioners are entitled to succeed and the impugned Circular dated 06-04-2018 is liable to be set aside on the ground of proportionality” — Supreme Court of India on the RBI circular banning banks from facilitating cryptocurrency-related transactions.

Cryptocurrency vs RBI. Finally, the judgement day arrived. And, what a judgement it was for the crypto industry. The three-Judge bench comprising of Rohinton Fali Nariman Aniruddha Bose and V. Ramasubramanian brought some much-needed respite for India’s cryptocurrency players.

Having given the reference of over 50 cases from across the world in its judgement, the 180-page-long judgement has not only brought a clear understanding of cryptocurrencies, their legal standing in India, but the judgement is also bound to set a precedent (as a reference) across many other countries in the world — developing countries, in particular.

Commenting over the judgement, Unocoin founder and CEO Sathvik Vishwanath told Inc42, “This marks an important milestone both in India and globally and helps in bringing positive perspective towards the crypto trading activity which became unclear during the wait. The arguments covered for this case includes everything you can think of including the regulations in other countries. So, it definitely will get impacted for final regulations.”

The entire crypto industry in India was celebrating the ruling on social media. Central to the fight were advocate Ashim Sood and Jaideep Reddy, technology lawyer-Nishith Desai Associates which represented the Internet & Mobile Association of India in the two years-long legal fight. Speaking to Inc42, Reddy said, “While I am still making my way through the Judgement, the ground for setting aside the circular is the doctrine of proportionality which states that the measure should be rationally connected to the objective and that it cannot be excessive, more than what is required.”

The court has stated that the RBI did not show that any harm was caused to banks and regulated entities due to virtual currency trading. It also held that no defect was pointed out in the functioning of the virtual currency exchanges and that virtual currency trading itself was not banned, added Reddy. The court also found that the banking system was a lifeline for virtual currency exchanges.

A top RBI officer, however, has a contradictory view to offer. On the condition of anonymity, the officer told Inc42 that the RBI’s duty is to protect the interest of Indian consumers under Section 45L of the RBI Act, 1934. In their opinion, arguments should have been put forward in a wider context. The judgement has rightly discussed the various reports published by FATF, RBI and others over the years, however, it does not delve into the reports that discuss the scams in detail, a regular phenomenon across the world.

“As has been pointed by media, tens of thousands of Indians have already been looted by various crypto scammers. As India does not have any crypto regulations, the issuance of RBI circular was the need-of-the-hour,” said the RBI officer.

Historic Day For Crypto Entities

Last few weeks or months have seen unprecedented crypto developments in the country. While big players like Binance, OKEx have made their way to Indian market either through acquisition or partnership, once India’s largest player Zebpay which had shut down its services also announced a comeback.

People who attended the last few hearings say “A sensible judgement was clearly in the air.”

Shivam Thakral, founder and CEO of BuyUCoin, terms the judgement a ’historic and proud moment for Indian crypto Industry.’ “The biggest plus point with the judgement is the backing of the Supreme Court of India, their faith in cryptocurrency as technology.”

From Zebpay to Kali Digital to Belfrics, ThroughBit, Koinex, Coinome, Coinsecure and many others — over a dozen of crypto entities operating in India had to shut down their shops due to the RBI circular from April 2018.

“All the exchanges in India, including Belfrics, who have shut down their exchange operations in India due to the non-cooperation of banks, will restart operations very soon. Now that the ruling has come in favour of digital currency operators, we should be seeing a heightened activity of trading in the days to come,” said Praveenkumar Vijayakumar, founder and CEO, Belfrics Group.

Another leading exchange Unocoin too had to face the brunt. While the founders were arrested even before launching India’s first Bitcoin ATM, the company had to downsize its staff due to the industry paralysis caused by the April 6 circular.

“The 22-month long wait to get what the crypto industry was already eligible for is now over,” said Vishwanath, founder and CEO.

Another London-based crypto startup Cashaa which had recently started offering Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies in INR has already announced plans to organise over 5000 KM long Indian Crypto Bull Roadshow, 2020 to increase awareness across the country.

The latest judgement appears a fresh-breath of air for Kumar Gaurav, founder & CEO Cashaa. In a statement shared with Inc42, he said, “We are looking forward to working with Indian banks to help them protect the county’s AML and CFT policies and also considering acquiring a Cooperative bank in India to build a crypto-friendly bank for local demand.”

Crypto Vs RBI: What Was The Case?

It all started with the Reserve Bank of India’s “Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies” on April 5, 2018, in which the central bank directed all the entities regulated by RBI not to deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling cryptocurrencies and to exit the relationship, if they already have one, with such individuals/ business entities, dealing with or settling cryptocurrencies.

The IAMAI on the behalf of Indian crypto startups filed a writ petition (Civil) in Supreme Court against the RBI on May 16, 2018. However, IAMAI wasn’t the first one to knock the doors of the court on this matter.

Ahmedabad-based crypto firm Kali Digital, which used to run multi-cryptocurrency exchange CoinRecoil, first filed a petition in Delhi High Court on April 16, 2018, followed by multiple other cases across India.

However, once the matter arrived in the Supreme Court, in August 2018, it clubbed all the crypto cases pending across various Courts in India.

The Arguments Which Won The Case

Since the beginning crypto entities have argued that the circular issued by the RBI violates Articles 19 (1) (g) and 14 of the Indian Constitution and at the same time, this will lead to the closure of such firms.

The Article 14 ‘Equality Before Law’ states that the state shall not deny any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India, prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. As per Article 19 (1) (g), all citizens shall have the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.

In its 104-page written submission, among the major arguments put forward by Counsel Ashim Sood on the behalf of IAMAI was that RBI had no capacity to issue such a circular. It is outside the zone of the RBI’s regulatory purview and that RBI had never before used its statutory powers in such a manner as to proscribe an economic activity based on the nature of the activity alone.

It was argued that the prohibition of any economic activity falls squarely within the realm of economic policy, which the state must express through legislation. The RBI, acting under a statute, cannot create such policy on its own.

Cryptocurrencies are not money or other legal tenders, but only goods/commodities, falling outside the purview of the RBI Act, 1934, Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, said the submission.

Will Exchanges’ Accounts Be Unfrozen?

One of the few Indian crypto exchanges who had successfully raised funding was Koinex. However, the exchange had to shut its shop in July 2019 after the Central Bank of India (CBI) froze its account which had over INR 12 Cr.

Despite multiple requests, the bank refused to unfreeze the account in the wake of RBI’s circular. As a result, Koinex had filed a separate petition in the Supreme Court requesting to access the account.

Addressing the issue, the three-judge bench said that the lukewarm response of RBI in this regard is wholly unjustified. Admittedly, the activities carried on by Koinex were not declared as unlawful.

“RBI is obliged to direct the Central Bank of India to defreeze the account and release the funds. Hence, RBI is directed to issue instructions forthwith to the Central Bank of India, and to release the funds lying in the account to the company together with interest at the rate applicable. There will be no order as to costs,” the judgement said.

Crypto Entities Won, But What Next?

On the question that what are the chances of RBI filing a review petition in the court, Reddy said that RBI has the legal option, but the grounds for invoking review are very narrow.

Is it a momentary relief, given the fact that the government has already proposed an out and out ban on cryptocurrencies in India barring some limited use and fiat digital currencies?

“Now, the ball is in the court of crypto industry, Parliament and government agencies. So, the industry needs to continue to show that it is responsible and self-regulate. And meanwhile, the government may consider balanced regulations that will protect the interests of consumers,” said Reddy.

Unocoin’s Vishwanath said he won’t be surprised if the government resets the crypto discourse. Along with other industry stakeholders, he believes that the judgement is bound to influence government thinking.

After the judgement, the industry has also demanded that cryptocurrencies must be included in the RBI’s regulatory sandbox.

L Viswanathan, Partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said that the RBI’s regulatory powers are wide and with the benefit of the Supreme Court’s judgment it is expected that RBI will reconsider its approach to cryptocurrency and come up with a new, calibrated framework or regulation that deals with the reality of these technological advancements.

Given that even central banks across the world are issuing their own cryptocurrencies, it is imperative to balance considerations of regulatory, consumer protection, security and monetary control that the RBI is expected to have over currency and financial products. This might also catalyse the potential for the use of blockchain in diverse areas.","The price of bitcoin (BTC) broke above $9,000 on a bullish run at 9:00 UTC (4:00 a.m. EST). The world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 4 percent in the past 24 hours, with a high reaching $9,150 on exchanges including Coinbase.

The last time bitcoin traded above $9,000 was on Feb. 26.

An uptrend started taking shape at 0:00 UTC Thursday as prices broke out of a steady $8,600 to $8,800 range. Bitcoin quickly surpassed its 50-day moving average at that time on higher buying volume than the same period yesterday.

After Wednesday's low volume kept bitcoin in a steady range, the market picked up, with prices crossing the $9,000 mark for the first time in March. Source: TradingView

The bullish run comes amid positive news regarding cryptocurrency from India’s Supreme Court. A decision allowing Indian banks to work with cryptocurrency firms reverses an April 2018 prohibition on providing such services to the country of over one billion people.

“The reckless ban on Indian banks working with cryptocurrency companies a few years ago was a big setback for Indian startups short term and the Indian economy long term,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in a recent tweet.

Bitcoin hasn’t been in the $9,000 price range since Feb. 26. Year to date, bitcoin is up 26 percent, outperforming the S&P 500’s 5 percent decline since Jan. 1.","The South Korean National Assembly passed new legislation today that will provide a framework for the regulation and legalization of cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges.

In a unanimous vote during a special session of the legislature convened amidst the country’s worsening novel coronavirus situation, the representatives passed an amendment to the country’s financial services laws that would authorize Korea’s financial regulators to effectively oversee the nascent industry and develop rules around anti-money laundering among other processes.

South Korea has been on the forefront of the cryptocurrency boom and bust over the past few years, and it’s one of the few countries with wide-scale adoption of the technology. Surveys at the height of the crypto craze in 2017 showed that more than a third of the country’s workers were active investors in cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other systems. The country’s largest city, Seoul, led a government initiative to introduce its own cryptocurrency — S-coin — that was designed to capture the zeitgeist of the frenzy.

During that period, South Korea’s government moved quickly to push new regulations and clamp down on the spread of blockchain, which caused large gyrations in the price of Bitcoin as investors observed how the country’s investors would react.

Today’s vote in the legislature just a few years later is a relatively quick turnaround for regulators, and shows the increasing acceptance of blockchain and, more specifically, cryptocurrencies in the context of financial services both locally and across the world. One of the country’s largest technology companies, Kakao, has continued to invest in blockchain initiatives, and the local ecosystem remains relatively robust in innovation in the sector.

The passage of the cryptocurrency legislation is a victory for the Korean startup ecosystem, but other major questions remain about the sector.

Among the most heated topics today is the fate of Tada (타다), the indigenous ride-hailing startup that competes with the traditional and regulated taxi industry. Since the company’s launch in late 2018, the company has faced constant threats of shut down by regulators, before a reprieve a few weeks ago by the country’s top constitutional court approved its operations.

Yet, in the same special session that saw the cryptocurrency bill pass, the National Assembly a day ago approved in committee a bill that would effectively ban Tada and mandate that it receive an operating license from the government. Expect further action on Tada in the weeks ahead.

As for the cryptocurrency law, its passage and presumed signing by South Korean president Moon Jae-in starts a months-long rulemaking process that will also provide time for existing startups and exchanges to transition into the law’s new regulatory apparatus.

Korea’s parliamentary elections are coming up in just a few weeks (on April 15th), and, while the situation around the novel coronavirus is taking a lion’s share of the local headlines, votes on tech measures are a way for representatives to position themselves on other salient issues before voters decide.","Dallas’ Zabo Raises $2.5M to Bring Crypto into Mainstream Financial Services Zabo was founded to solve what it calls one of the most critical, missing pieces of infrastructure: an API that connects to the landscape of cryptocurrency accounts and wallets.

Zabo, a Dallas-based cryptocurrency startup, has announced a $2.5 million funding round led by Moonshots Capital. The capital will be used to expand its engineering team and increase its customer base.



“In the last decade we’ve seen incredible growth in crypto, both as a financial asset and paradigm-shifting technology infrastructure,” Zabo wrote in a company blog post. “Financial and computer science history have already been made. But the best is yet to come—the growth of crypto the next decade will dwarf its prior history.”

Zabo’s technology allows any financial services company—banks, brokerage firms, fintechs—to connect to customers’ crypto wallets. The API integrates with thousands of exchanges, wallets, and cryptocurrencies, which Zabo says are required to power the next generation of financial products and services.

Its solution can be used across the financial services space, including personal financial management, investments, digital banking, tax software, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Cryptocurrency is an asset class on track to reach billions of customers and measuring in the trillions of dollars, according to Zabo Co-founder Christopher Brown. The marketplace challenge is cryptocurrency is underserved in relation to other financial services because, in part, connecting the different currencies, wallets, and exchanges to the traditional financial system is difficult.

Zabo’s solution takes the complexity out of this integration.

“Cryptocurrency is quickly becoming a mainstream asset class,” said Alex Treece, Zabo’s co-founder and president, in a statement. “Unfortunately, fintechs, banks and brokerage firms have been very challenged to provide services, in part because their current technology doesn’t support cryptocurrency. This comes at a time when the next generation of customers, who prefer to own cryptocurrency more than shares in stocks like Disney and Netflix, are in the process of selecting their primary financial institutions.”

Also participating in the funding round was Blockchange Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, Digital Currency Group, CoinShares, Tezos Foundation, Capital Factory, and others. On its site, Zabo said the money will go to three specific things: growing its family, adding more partners and connection into the Zabo API, and increasing customer and partner support.

“Zabo has put together an impressive team and have been experts in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space for years,” Craig Cummings, General Partner at Moonshots Capital, said of the investment. “They have built an incredibly important piece of technical infrastructure that will enable cryptocurrency financial services to touch billions of people.”

Dallas-Fort Worth-based Zabo was co-founded by Brown, CEO; Treece, president; and William Dias, CTO, who operates out of Toronto.

About two years ago, Zabo got a $1.15 million seed investment from New York-based Blockchange Ventures. The funding went toward creating the app, supporting Bitcoin and Ether, and allowing users to have crypto combined with their bank accounts. Last year, Zabo launched Papercrypto, a risk-free simulation designed to “demystify, derisk, and devour cryptoconfusion.” Essentially, it’s a free game that allows anyone to construct a virtual portfolio of cryptocurrencies.

Also last year, Brown was named one of our 26 North Texas innovators who are the future today. He and his team officially launched Zabo in September 2019.

The Department of the Treasury placed their names (and 20 of their Bitcoin accounts) on a list of foreign individuals and entities that are blocked from doing business in the US.

The government also unsealed a legal document explaining why it wants to seize 113 cryptocurrency accounts associated with North Korean money laundering. That document painted a detailed picture of Tian and Li’s alleged crimes. And it lifted the curtain on a high-tech cat-and-mouse-style conflict going on behind the scenes, in which launderers have turned to elaborate automated schemes to obfuscate their cryptocurrency transactions and flummox law enforcement.

Kim Jong-un’s regime is economically isolated by sanctions aimed at hampering its nuclear weapons program. In the past few years it has turned to the cryptocurrency world to generate revenue, mostly by stealing it. In August last year, sanctions experts told the United Nations not only that North Korea has used “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” cyberattacks to pilfer as much as $2 billion from crypto exchanges and other financial institutions, but also that it is using the money to fund its weapons program.

The North Koreans have also apparently become experts in the dark art of digital money laundering. It makes sense: very few businesses accept cryptocurrency, so the North Koreans need a way of converting their stolen crypto-cash into good old-fashioned dollars or some other fiat currency.

This is where the freshly indicted Tian and Li come in: allegedly, they were cogs in an elaborate money-laundering machine that successfully cashed out $100 million worth of stolen cryptocurrency. The US says that in late 2018, hackers working for Kim Jong-un stole around $250 million worth of cryptocurrency from an unnamed South Korean exchange. Much of that money, mostly Bitcoin, apparently landed in accounts at different exchanges held by Tian and Li, who converted it into fiat currency. But it’s what happened before it got to them that is really eye-opening.

Anyone trying to launder illicit cryptocurrency funds faces at least two big challenges. First, you can’t just deposit huge sums of Bitcoin at different exchanges without raising red flags. Second, and perhaps more important, Bitcoin transactions can be traced; they are all recorded on its public blockchain. Users are pseudonymous, represented on the blockchain by strings of numbers and letters called addresses. But if investigators can tie an address to a real-world identity, they can track its every single transaction.

To clear these hurdles, the North Korean hackers sent the stolen Bitcoin through a long chain of transfers to new addresses, each of which peeled a small piece from the whole and sent it to yet another address, often associated with an account at an exchange.

According to the government, the North Koreans engaged in “hundreds of automated transactions” with new Bitcoin addresses to create so-called “peel chains” leading to four different exchanges, making them hard to track.

Peel chains can become very complicated when they get long, and particularly when money launderers generate new ones using money peeled from the original—”peel chains of peel chains,” says Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm. They make it difficult to determine when money is actually changing hands and when it is just being moved to another address the money launderer controls, he says.

Meanwhile, the use of exchanges to launder stolen cryptocurrency appears to be a growing problem. According to Chainalysis, in 2019 criminal entities moved $2.8 billion in Bitcoin to exchanges—up from around $1 billion the year before. How is this happening, given that most exchanges are required by anti-money-laundering rules to keep track of their customers’ identities? Chainalysis has concluded that money launderers have found a workaround: a small number of “rogue” brokers who use their legitimate-appearing accounts at exchanges to help them cash out. That sounds a lot like how the US government describes the work of Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong.","Why did this happen?

This formalizes the already significant contributions made by the company toward the cryptocurrency.

Through a March 4 announcement, the company announced that the Square Grants program would be made publicly available. Two developers had already received grants: BTCPayServer received $100,000 to continue development of its open-source payment processor, and a pseudonymous developer received an undisclosed sum in connection to Lightning Network development.

With the announcement, Square revealed to have also granted undisclosed amounts to Jon Atack and Tankred Hase, two Bitcoin developers who have previously done significant work in the space.

How to apply for grants

Square has made the conditions for joining the program public. The rules state that grants can be received by a team or individuals all around the world, provided that they work on a Bitcoin project.

The proposals must improve Bitcoin’s user experience, scaling, privacy, security or “something else we haven’t thought of,” Square wrote. The developers must also be “in good standing” within the Bitcoin community.

The team listed several examples of applicable projects, citing new layer two solutions, privacy implementations like Payjoin or SNICKER, new wallets and several others.

Applicants need to send an email to Square and write a detailed proposal text. “We’ll get back to you if it excites us and lines up with grant criteria,” the announcement reads.

Square’s previous work

Square is a payments company led by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and it offers a wide variety of products in the payments ecosystem.

One of these is Cash App, a financial product for consumers that increasingly relies on Bitcoin to make revenue. In February, it was revealed that almost half of its earnings come from cryptocurrency users. The app allows them to purchase BTC in small amounts, with the average user only trading $7.50 every month.

Square is pushing forward with more cryptocurrency integrations, having obtained a patent for real-time crypto-to-fiat swaps in January. It is also actively supporting Bitcoin development through initiatives such as the Lightning Development Kit.

The company’s actions are not going unscrutinized, as some in the community raised questions on whether Square could influence Bitcoin’s development decisions."
2020-03-06,"While the Indian cryptocurrency industry has won a court battle over a central bank ban on banking access, the war may not yet be over.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) – which issued an order to cut off crypto firms from the country’s financial system in April 2018 – now says it plans to return to the Supreme Court to fight the Wednesday ruling that overturned its ban, according to an Economic Times report Friday.

The RBI will lodge a review petition over the court judges’ ruling that the RBI had not been balanced in issuing the order, sources said. Concerns that the restarting of crypto trading could pose a risk to the banking system were cited as the primary reason behind the central bank’s coming response.

Since Wednesday’s ruling, some Indian cryptocurrency exchanges have already announced they have reinstated deposits and withdrawals via bank accounts. Local commentators are predicting a surge in crypto activity in India, where for two years exchanges have been forced to either close, leave the country or turn to solely crypto-to-crypto trading.

“This is the first step towards embracing cryptocurrency in India, which has the potential of becoming one of the largest crypto markets.” Ashish Singhal, chief executive of the CoinSwitch exchange, told CoinDesk after the court’s ruling.","RBI to Challenge Supreme Court Verdict on Cryptocurrency

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is reportedly seeking to file a review petition challenging the supreme court verdict which lifted its banking ban on the crypto industry. The RBI is worried that the court’s decision “could pave the way for trading in virtual currencies and put the banking system at risk.”

Unhappy With Supreme Court Verdict, RBI to File Review Petition

India’s central bank is planning to file a review petition with the Supreme Court of India against the quashing of its circular aimed at curbing cryptocurrencies, the Economic Times reported Friday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The news outlet detailed:

The central bank is concerned that the apex court’s decision on Wednesday could pave the way for trading in virtual currencies and put the banking system at risk.

The RBI issued a circular in April 2018 banning banks from providing services to crypto businesses, including exchanges. The ban went into effect in July that year and banks proceeded to close the accounts of crypto exchanges. The ban was imposed after the RBI issued several warnings regarding the trading of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, but crypto trading remained unaffected. The banking ban forced some crypto exchanges out of business, such as Zebpay, Coindelta, and Koinex. Zebpay recently relaunched in India.

Supreme Court Verdict Upholds Legality of Cryptocurrencies

The Indian supreme court said that the right to create something that does not violate any existing rule is an unsaid fundamental law, the news outlet conveyed. “Hence, citizens have the right to create a new industry of cryptocurrencies and exchanges along with the fundamental right to trade … the central bank hadn’t demonstrated that trading in such currencies was damaging to the entities it regulated.”

In its March 4 order which allowed a plea challenging the RBI’s 2018 circular, the supreme court reportedly noted:

Trading in cryptocurrencies now will be allowed.

Immediately after the supreme court verdict, crypto enthusiasts worldwide went wild on social media with victorious comments, and several crypto exchanges rushed to resume offering INR deposits and withdrawals through bank accounts.

“We welcome the supreme court’s decision to lift RBI’s ban on trading in cryptocurrency,” tweeted the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom), a major trade association of Indian information technology and business process outsourcing industry. “We believe that banning tech is not the solution, a risk-based framework must be developed to regulate and monitor cryptocurrencies and tokens.” Both the RBI and the Indian government have previously confirmed that cryptocurrencies themselves are not banned in India. The RBI restriction only applies to regulated financial institutions.

Sidharth Sogani, CEO of crypto research firm Crebaco Global Inc., was quoted as saying:

In a way, the verdict upholds the legality of cryptocurrencies and decriminalises the investors who have already invested in various crypto assets like bitcoin, ether, and various others.

Meanwhile, the Indian government still has not decided about the country’s crypto policy. The “Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019” was submitted to the finance ministry in February last year. It was drafted by an interministerial committee (IMC), headed by former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg. The committee was tasked with studying all aspects of cryptocurrency and providing recommendations for the country’s crypto policy. The bill was supposed to be introduced in parliament in the winter session last year but it was not.

For the crypto exchanges, this is extremely good news and they can now get back to business. Many of these exchanges saw their revenue slashed by up to 90%, with some even shutting down. Those that had the financial muscle relocated to other countries.

Already, the exchanges have sprung into action, integrating crypto/rupee trading pairs and bank account transfers on their platforms. One of these is CoinDCX, one of the largest exchanges in India. Just six hours after the ban was lifted, the exchange revealed that it had integrated bank account transfers.

The CEO, Sumit Gupta told CoinGeek, “India’s crypto environment is going to have a transformation after the court verdict. Because of this, crypto-INR pairs are going to see a massive jump as new investors (both institutional and retail) can now invest in the crypto markets without any hesitation or skepticism. The market is open for everyone in India now.”

Gupta believes that the lifting of the ban will open up a huge market, as the “integration of banking channels makes the whole process of crypto adoption simpler. With renewed accessibility and convenience in purchasing cryptocurrencies, we believe that this change will have a dramatic effect in accelerating crypto adoption in India.”

With a population of 1.3 billion people, second only to China, India offers a large market for cryptos. However, ambiguous regulations and the RBI ban have hindered the spread of crypto. The lifting of the ban is a great first step and could see the trading volume spike back to former levels.

Vishal Gupta, an entrepreneur behind a number of crypto startups in India told Livemint, “Volumes in the Indian market could increase by 100, 200 or even 500 times.” India used to account for over 2,500 in BTC traded (currently worth over $22 million), he stated. He expects the trading volume to be even higher in three months’ time.

Ashish Singhal, the CEO of CoinSwitch exchange puts this number even higher, estimating that India used to account for up to $60 million worth of daily traded volume before the ban. With the court’s decision, the country could become one of the largest markets globally, he believes.

The RBI ban only restricted crypto entities from accessing banking services. However, misinformation was rife in India and many people interpreted it as a blanket ban on crypto, assuming they were illegal. With the ban now lifted, the crypto community has the task of educating the masses about crypto. The media must also play its part, Gaurav Dahake, the CEO of Bitbns exchange believes.

He stated, “Besides, we hope the media houses across the country would cover the news positively and the myths questioning the legality of crypto in India, would ideally be reduced to nil.”

Great as this victory is for the crypto industry, much more needs to be done. Top among them is the implementation of regulations. India has yet to formulate regulations for crypto amidst reports that the government was working on a total ban for cryptos.

Raghy Mohan, the founder and CEO of IBC Media told Livemint, “At the outset, what it looks like is that at least common sense has prevailed. But I wouldn’t go far as to say that this is the start of positive regulation for crypto.”

The CEO of P2P crypto trading platform Tandem, Prashant Swaminathan agrees, stating that this is just the first step. He stated, “There’s still a bill that the Parliament has to discuss. It has changed shapes and forms but hopefully this will be the framework for how cryptocurrency is traded in the country.”

The future of the Indian crypto industry is still unclear. Nevertheless, the lifting of the banking ban by the Supreme Court is a step in the right direction and will give the industry hope that positive regulations will be forthcoming in the near future.

After sharp gains in price Thursday, bitcoin (BTC) has been trading steadily in a range between $9,000 and $9,200. For the past 24 hours, bitcoin’s price change has been minimal, down half a percent as of 18:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET).

Traders see bitcoin’s jump back into the $9,000 range as another sign bitcoin is trending upward in 2020 while traditional markets stumble. Year to date, bitcoin is up over 26 percent while the S&P 500 stock index is down 9 percent. Cryptocurrency sentiment appears bullish as prices remain above significant moving averages.

Although traders seem to be open to viewing the cryptocurrency markets as a safe haven from stock market turmoil, more volatility is possible ahead of May’s halving, an event that will slash in half the reward bitcoin miners obtain.

“It’s a relief rally. In my opinion, we have a likelihood of sweeping another low before the post-halvening rally,” said Mostafa Al-Mashita of Canadian crypto brokerage firm Secure Digital Markets.

The S&P 500 closed down 3 percent Thursday as coronavirus fears reversed the small post-Super Tuesday rally. Equities traders cheered the results of the U.S. Democratic primary election favoring former Vice President Joe Biden over senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, candidates seen as openly hostile to capital markets. Also, bitcoin prices moved higher on optimistic banking news from India and positive regulatory clarity from South Korea.

“I believe gold and BTC are safe havens,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based crypto OTC trader. “As coronavirus has just started to spread, I believe a strong market will last well until the halving will have effect. To me it seems plausible that we can hit an all-time high this year, perhaps within six months.”","By Landon Manning

As the threat of COVID-19, better known as coronavirus, has been soliciting reactions from institutions of government, media and finance, the cryptocurrency community has offered a number of novel insights and practical approaches.

The Coinbase Approach to Quarantine

Tech-centric companies attached to a wide variety of industries and with operations that depend on China, where the outbreak of COVID-19 originated, have been particularly affected by the issue, and many large conglomerates have adopted a uniform policy on disease response strategies. Several major firms , such as Apple, Google and Amazon, have been instructing employees to work from home as a way to enforce the strict quarantine policy that health authorities recommend.

Meanwhile, leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has formally codified a multistage disease response plan into company policy, basing its system on how employees and company offices as a whole will act when certain possibilities occur, such as a rise in coronavirus cases within the vicinity of Coinbase offices. In addition to this system of having employees avoid contact with the public, Coinbase’s plan includes a threat assessment system that works on a case-by-case basis.

The most prominent potential infection location for Coinbase employees is in Japan, which the company rates as a “Stage 1” area — more of an active threat than in places like the United States, but much less so than mainland China. Developing plans like this in a low-stress environment may prove critical for making sure that the cryptocurrency industry’s most foundational businesses can keep the flow of crypto assets open, despite the harshest pressures that coronavirus spread may present.

The Remote World of Cryptocurrency

Several blockchain and cryptocurrency startups within mainland China have been forced to take countermeasures to the life-altering disruption of the coronavirus, such as a complete overhaul of the work-from-home protocol and handling of in-person conferences, the latter of which often represents a critical source of contact and revenue for the cryptocurrency startup ecosystem inside China. The decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency and blockchain space has been a particular advantage for this sort of planning, as many tech workers are already accustomed to getting sophisticated projects off the ground without having to physically congregate at a corporate office building.

Many of the companies in the space have developed their own ways to combat the threat of coronavirus, and there is definitely evidence that the entrepreneurial spirit is going strong as well. Already, an international group of developers has been issuing a “CoronaCoin,” with its supply based on the number of reported deaths. With the asset already lambasted as a morbid joke, the creators have defended their actions, comparing it to the World Health Organization’s issue of pandemic bonds, which accrue value in a similar fashion. Although this particular venture seems like something of a flash in the pan, it does represent a good case study for the reality that the space’s developers are willing to take this affair in stride. If nothing else, it’ll take a lot more to deflate the enthusiasm we’ve seen.

The question of how to keep the various businesses within the cryptocurrency economy running well in the event of a coronavirus spread is particularly relevant for a number of reasons. As the traditional stock market has been sustaining heavy blows due to the coronavirus, the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been relatively higher, though the market has dropped overall. Some financial analysts have speculated on the potential effects of this decline, claiming that a plunge in bitcoin’s valuation alongside a disruption in the businesses of the crypto community could have long-reaching implications for the future of the space.

Ultimately, the success of bitcoin as a currency for the future is not dependent on its price at any given time. Instead, bitcoin will be able to thrive as long as the people who make up the crypto space are able to treat it as a living thing, keeping the engines of economic deals alive while the community can hang on to its belief in a crypto future.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Brian Armstrong, CEO of digital currency exchange Coinbase, says Bitcoin (BTC) may be surpassed by other digital coins as the crypto industry evolves into maturity.

In a series of tweets, Armstrong highlights the parallels between the early internet and cryptocurrency. He says challenges that early internet developers faced are comparable to those that hound today’s young crypto industry.

“At Netscape, they were working with early internet protocols. Things weren’t very scalable (dial up modems), you had to be somewhat technical to figure out how to get online, and early websites were pretty basic (static sites, looked like toys).

Sound familiar to crypto at all??

They figured they’d try making a shopping cart (see if they could build a first party app).

There was no way to save state or create a session (for instance, to make a shopping cart), so they created the concept of cookies.

Then, next problem was that nobody wanted to put a credit card into the internet, because everything plain text over http. So they went and invented SSL/HTTPS.”

Armstrong says that just as early internet users came up with better web tools, the 11-year-old crypto industry is also gearing up toward new solutions.

“Slow internet speeds/dial up models reflect early challenges in scaling blockchains.

SSL and HTTPs are similar to some of the privacy coin efforts.”

Based on the parallels of the two industries, Armstrong cites the features that digital coins need for the crypto industry to reach mass adoption.

“For me, the biggest areas of development I see that I think we need to get right as an industry are: 1. Scalability – we need blockchains that can get to at least thousands of TPS to get mainstream adoption of crypto (similar to broadband internet being a big unlock on the web)

2. Privacy – perhaps a contrarian view, but I think we’ll need privacy coins, just like we needed HTTPS as the default on the web, for many use cases in crypto long term. Everyone deserves access to financial services, and financial privacy.”

Transaction scalability and privacy are two features that Bitcoin currently lacks. Because of these deficiencies, Armstrong says there is ultimately an opportunity for an altcoin to become the dominant crypto asset in the future.

The cryptocurrency and security token exchange startup is targeting an April launch date for the IPO, people familiar with the situation said. INX is about to kick off a series of presentations to potential investors, known as a roadshow, which was originally supposed to start in January, the sources said. The firm has hired a European investment bank to act as lead underwriter for the IPO, they said.

INX is positioning itself as a mature, dutifully compliant exchange eschewing the “beg forgiveness, don’t ask permission” practices that have defined the crypto industry for most of its history. Unlike the initial coin offerings (ICO) that claimed exemptions from securities laws by arguing their tokens weren’t investments or by selling only to wealthy investors, INX is registering with the SEC so it can solicit the general public. The process has taken the company two years.

Doubling down on compliance, the company plans to relocate its headquarters from the blockchain-friendly jurisdiction of Gibraltar to New York, INX disclosed in its prospectus, which was updated on Monday. That means it will have to obtain a state BitLicense to serve residents, and it is in talks with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to obtain one, the people familiar with the situation said.

This is the regulatory equivalent of transferring from a community college to MIT. Only about 20 BitLicenses have been granted since the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) finalized its regulation in 2015, although regulatory sources said the agency has assembled a team to expedite applications. Exchanges including Kraken and ShapeShift stopped doing business in New York, calling the license’s requirements onerous, and NYDFS recently began to reassess its rules.

In December, the deadline passed for the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register objections to INX’s prospectus, filed over the summer. With no comments received from the SEC, the company was free to proceed with the offering, which will be sold in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

Cast of characters

The proceeds from the IPO would fund the launch of a crypto exchange, known as INX Digital, and security token platform, INX Securities. In preparation, INX has lined up several partners.

For example, INX has tapped Anchorage and BitGo to custody digital assets on behalf of the exchange’s clients, people familiar with the exchange said. Anchorage confirmed its involvement, and INX named BitGo in an SEC filing.

Further, Tokensoft is providing design and tech advisory services and Quantstamp will audit the exchange’s smart contract code, according to the filing.

INX’s token would be listed on its own security token platform and on other exchanges, according to the sources.

Holders of INX’s tokens would get a share of the company’s profits and stand in line ahead of equity investors for repayment in the event of bankruptcy; the tokens would also be accepted as payment for trading fees.

Meantime, INX has obtained money transmitter licenses in eight U.S. states so its crypto exchange will be allowed to handle fiat on-ramp and crypto-to-crypto transactions, the filing said.","WASHINGTON — “We might be overcomplicating things,” an audience member at the Internal Revenue Service’s crypto summit said midway through the first panel.

The IRS hosted four panels Tuesday, discussing technology, exchanges, the tax filing process and regulatory guidance in a daylong session uniting industry stakeholders, tax experts and regulators. The goal: Sort out some of the questions and concerns the broader crypto-holding public has about reporting its taxes.

While there were no answers and no new guidance for the industry (though virtual currency did make it to the IRS’s priority guidance plan published Friday), the event still represents a step forward for the opaque regulatory agency, which in a decade has only produced two pieces of binding guidance and published some non-binding documents for taxpayers and financial advisors.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

“There’s a clear desire from both industry and regulators to understand this,” Chandan Lodha of CoinTracker told CoinDesk.

Financial advisers want to ensure they don’t have their clients fulfill costly reporting requirements only to discover they didn’t need to, EY partner Michael Meisler said during a panel. At another point a Coinbase vice president asked for clarity about reporting forms.

On the IRS side, numerous agency employees filled the auditorium with questions of their own, asking for clarity on how blockchain forensics works on a technical level, how privacy coins differ from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and even just what specifically they could do to simplify the process for taxpayers.

There is some frustration on the industry side at the lack of existing guidance, and the event did not indicate that any new guidance will be forthcoming. Still, Lodha said the event was a positive step.

Unlike traditional panels, where a moderator asks panelists questions, the IRS event seemed geared from the outset to let audience members and even panelists ask IRS officials to clarify existing tax guidance and address lingering questions.

Calculations and filing

Specific questions included the best ways to calculate cost basis, how to treat coins bought from different exchanges or transferred between exchanges, whether microtransactions can be exempted and how to marry what tax code says with non-binding guidance published by the IRS so far.

“It would certainly be more helpful … if there was published guidance rather than just these frequently-asked-questions because in the absence of that, what we have is, ‘Well, this isn’t really authority,’” said EY’s Meisler, during a panel on tax return preparation.

It was a common refrain.

Audience members and panelists alike – including Kraken Head of Global Tax Lisa Askenazy Felix, Coinbase tax VP Kyle Zander and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) senior manager Amy Yiqiong Wang – said a lot of confusion stems from the fact that a lot of cryptocurrencies still don’t fall neatly into any existing tax laws.

“The rules don’t exist today to tell you exactly [how] to [file taxes],” Askenazy Felix said during a panel on exchanges.

EY’s Meisler told CoinDesk after the event that he believed it went well, noting IRS Assistant Deputy Commissioner John Cardone opened his panel by telling audience members the tax collector was looking for specific issues of interest to the industry.

“The people that were there from industry were asking questions that were very targeted, whether they develop software that conducts tax calculations or they were from exchanges, they were asking specific questions,” Meisler said.

One key detail that remains unclear is how exactly taxpayers can calculate the value of their digital assets.

The IRS has indicated in its frequently asked questions that individuals who buy and sell crypto at different times can use a method like “first-in-first-out,” meaning if you buy bitcoin in January, March and April and sell in July, August and September, you would calculate the difference in price between the first bitcoin you bought in January and the first bitcoin you sold in July.

However, this may not actually be allowable.

AICPA’s Wang said during a panel the tax code says users “should use specific identity,” meaning the cost should be calculated on the actual specific bitcoin being transacted.

“So there is no binding authority at the moment that allows you to use anything other than specific identification,” she said. “It’s really important for practitioners that the IRS comes out with clarity and guidance saying you can use other forms of tracking basis.”

'Sophistication'

While there were specific questions, various IRS officials also asked what the crypto industry might see as more basic questions – including “what is an API,” what regulatory arbitrage is and how cryptocurrencies are transacted.

“I’m getting the sense there’s a wide array of sophistication in the room,” said Coinsource’s Arnold Spencer during a panel on technology updates.

Meisler told CoinDesk that having individuals who appeared to have different levels of understanding about the crypto space and technology is not surprising, and having everyone in a room together was likely a good thing.

“Before someone can answer ‘How do we tax cryptocurrency?’ or ‘How do we tax a hard fork or an airdrop?’ it’s helpful to understand what the mechanics of those transactions are,” he said.

It’s unclear whether the IRS will be able to publish anything actionable in the near future. However, there are some steps it can take immediately to clarify its existing guidance. Wang told CoinDesk that just moving its list of FAQs into the Internal Review Bulletin would provide some clarity, a view Meisler echoed.

Because the FAQs are not published in the bulletin, they’re not binding guidance; the IRS can change any recommendations on it as it wishes, which the agency has actually been doing, Wang said.

Some of the questions on the FAQ now appear at different points than when first published."

Industry watchers cheered on March 6 when the Supreme Court of India struck down the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) ban on financial institutions providing banking services to cryptocurrency businesses. However, embedded in the text of the judgment are multiple red flags.

In addition, a draft bill to ban cryptocurrencies, released on Feb. 28, 2019, could still move through Parliament. As analyzed by me previously, taken together, red flags in the court victory and the possibility of legislation moving forward mean that crypto’s legal status in India remains vulnerable.

The fine print

A review of the 180-page judgment reveals the premises of the verdict are not in alignment with what the industry has assumed.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

In essence, the entire verdict hinges on the violation of one of the fundamental rights of the Indian constitution – Article 19 (1) (g), which guarantees the freedom to practice any profession. The Supreme Court concluded the RBI’s measure violated Article 19 (1) (g) for virtual currency exchanges, and that the prohibition measure was not proportional to the threat. The verdict also concluded the central bank had not substantiated the threat with empirical data or credibly examined alternative measures.

However, one of the reasons the Supreme Court supported the industry was because there was “no law banning virtual currencies yet,” which implies the verdict would not stand once there is such a law.

The court also referred to cryptocurrencies as a “by-product” of blockchain technology and said the government could separate the two. This refrain of segregating blockchain and crypto has been the premise behind most federal policy to date.

In a detailed post-verdict analysis, I go over specific excerpts of the judgment, examine other red flags and discuss immediate possible reactions to the verdict.

The industry has won a hard-fought battle, and we can expect to not see a similar reactive prohibition again. However, the clock is ticking on the response of the legislative branch, which could move soon to enact legislation. The central bank, however, can only move a successful appeal if it amasses credible evidence of a monetary risk from cryptocurrencies.

Positive signals

Outside the realm of financial regulators and legislators there have been many government voices speaking up for a more progressive approach to blockchain in India.

The federal ministry for IT recently released a Draft National Strategy for Blockchain. This report looked at more advanced applications of blockchain, for example around data monetization, and pushed for building a global developer hub of blockchain talent in India. This report was surprisingly critical of policy actions, stating publicly that “awareness of blockchain within government is very poor” and that “lack of regulatory clarity” is the No. 1 obstacle to investment in the sector.

Many state-level governments, especially those with a strong IT sector and startup footprints, have been actively trying to build blockchain ecosystems. The state of Karnataka, which is home to India’s equivalent of Silicon Valley, Bangalore, and whose government I had assisted in 2018, was actively looking to build pilots. It even conducted one of India’s largest blockchain hackathons with challenges built from within government departments with a plan to move promising ideas into execution. All activity froze in the aftermath of the RBI’s circular, and the state reached out to the federal government.

Over the last two years, I have also worked with other leading states, all of which are in dialogue with the federal government for regulation to boost growth in blockchain.

The state of Telangana, home to Hyderabad, has designated an entire area as its “blockchain district,” with infrastructure geared for blockchain startups. Another state, Tamil Nadu, has announced an ambitious blockchain backbone on e-governance, which could be one of the largest projects in the world, covering 10 million citizens. All these states are engaged in dialogue on regulation with the federal government through internal channels.","Let’s see what crypto was up to this week. Major victories have been won: South Korean National Assembly voted in favor of the country’s first cryptocurrency-specific legislation, and India’s crypto ban got overruled, though the fight is not over. Bitcoin may be too young to be predictable, but it comes with a major advantage; also, Bitcoin-powered alternative to 5 peso note was issued in Argentina. Developers and dapps started leaving the Steem ecosystem following Tron’s and Steem’s hard fork decision, Binance halted trading again, Ripple's CEO said the company would be unprofitable without XRP, and Ripple-friendly SBI chief is in talks about launching an STO exchange. Meanwhile, Coinbase has become a second-tier member of JVCEA, while its CEO isn't sure Bitcoin will win crypto adoption race, and Facebook’s Libra could become a multi-coin payments network.

In the meantime, investors sued Canaan, a well-functioning government might make private cryptos obsolete, and crypto custody could help keep South Korea’s biggest exchanges afloat. While Xiaomi set up a joint venture to focus on new business areas, including blockchain, HTC announced the release of the Exodus 5G Hub, and Beijing started piloting blockchain-based electronic invoicing. We learned that in some regions, over 50% of the population are unbanked, presenting huge opportunities for crypto, and we looked into the importance of the new protocol by EY, ConsenSys, and Microsoft for Ethereum, and into Google possibly purging its app marketplace of crypto media sites.

Victories and opportunities done. Joke time!

The German financial authority elaborated that since cryptocurrencies are financial instruments pursuant to the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz – KWG), the company is conducting proprietary trading on a commercial basis without the required authorization. “It is, therefore, conducting unauthorized business,” the regulator alleged.

Shitcoins Club’s ATMs

Shitcoins Club cryptocurrency ATMs can be found in shopping centers, self-service shops and other locations around Europe. The Polish company’s ATMs “feature bald and exciting design, which represents the true spirit of cryptocurrency. Their ATMs are not easily missed,” cryptocurrency ATM tracking website Coinatmradar describes, adding that the company operates two types of crypto ATMs.

“All of our ATMs are designed and built by our company. We are offering transactions in the following cryptocurrencies: bitcoin ethereum, litecoin and dash. You can purchase cryptos for EUR, USD, GBP, CHF in most of our ATMs. You can also use our webpage shitcoins.club to sell cryptos and pay out money at one of our ATMs using redeemable code,” the company’s website explains.

According to its website, the company operates ATMs in Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Romania, France, Spain, and the Netherlands. It also offers face to face buying and selling of cryptocurrencies.

Following BaFin’s order, the company’s crypto ATM listings for Germany on Coinatmradar display a warning that reads: “This bitcoin ATM is temporarily not working (since 4th of March 2020). Due to BaFin’s decision we are forced to close our ATMs for the time being. We will be back with our services as soon as possible.” The company recently installed some cryptocurrency ATMs in Germany, such as in Nürnberg on Jan. 22 and Hamburg on Dec. 7.

According to Coinatmradar, there are currently 71 cryptocurrency ATMs in Germany, 13 of which are in Stuttgart, seven in Berlin, and six in Frankfurt. In addition, four cities have five crypto ATMs each: Cologne, Dusseldorf, Freiburg im Breisgau, and Munich. Worldwide, there are 7086 cryptocurrency ATMs, Coinatmradar shows. The website also allows users to search for a bitcoin ATM near them.

New German Crypto Regulation

Germany’s amendment to the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive entered into force on Jan. 1, effectively regulating the crypto industry. BaFin told news.Bitcoin.com that financial services companies as of that date must submit their intent to apply for a license by March 31 and complete a license application by Nov. 30. The length of time it takes for an applicant to be granted a license depends on the individual case.

More than 40 financial institutions in Germany have reportedly declared that they are interested in offering cryptocurrency custody services under the new German law. BaFin recently further clarified the regulation. German banks are also struggling to cope with the negative interest rate policy maintained by the European Central Bank (ECB). At least 41 banks in the country are now charging their customers negative interest rates and the number is rising.

""I think everyone will continue to listen to the feedback and the notes from the SEC, what their comments are, and they will continue to address it.""

Even so, market commentators struggle to believe this is the end of the road for the long-awaited fund.

The Securities and Exchange Commission last week issued yet another rejection to a prospective issuer, Wilshire Phoenix, for a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund, the latest in a series of failed attempts by firms to push a bitcoin ETF past regulators.

If market and investor demand eventually tips the scales in bitcoin's favor, the SEC will likely review the applications and could come to a different conclusion, Hempstead said.

""They'll probably take another look at it and have different kinds of considerations,"" he said. ""I don't think it's the last straw, but I don't predict any significant changes from the SEC's decision in the near future.""

DataTrek Research co-founder Nick Colas, who said in January that the odds of a bitcoin ETF getting approved this year were 10%, maintained his not-so-peachy outlook.

""You'll see a central bank cryptocurrency before you'll see a bitcoin ETF,"" Colas said.

That could come in the form of a digital coin tethered to the U.S. dollar, which could make for frictionless virtual transactions, but, in many ways, the market already has that in place, said Dan Wiener, the chairman of Adviser Investments and the senior editor of The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, a widely followed daily newsletter.

""People use Venmo right now. They can move their money around. It's not that big a deal. Do we really need bitcoin? I'm not a drug dealer. I'm not worried about moving money,"" Wiener said in the same ""ETF Edge"" interview. ""More important is blockchain technology, how businesses are using blockchain. Bitcoin or any of these other coins are just a manifestation of a technology.""

Bitcoin has climbed to above $9,000 this year after cooling off toward the end of 2019. Bitcoin bulls including cryptocurrency investor Michael Novogratz have said bitcoin could hit all-time highs in 2020.

Disclaimer","The world of Bitcoin involves a lot of speculation of what the future will be like. Through the power of unlimited on chain scaling, Bitcoin SV (BSV) offers a world where much of the data and transactions of the world can be immutably recorded on chain, and micro transactions create entirely new business plans for intrepid individuals to pursue. But in fictional future of Netflix’s Altered Carbon, cryptocurrencies appear to have found their place as nothing but black market currencies.

If you’re unfamiliar with Altered Carbon, the show depicts our galaxy several centuries in the future, where a breathrough in science has allowed the rich and powerful to avoid permanent death by passing their consciousness into new bodies indefinitely. The central conflict of the show is between those with power and infinite life, nicknamed the Meths, and the various groups principally opposed to this technology due to the imbalance it creates between rich and poor. The main character of the show, Takeshi Kovacs, falls in the second camp.

The currency of the future is typically referred to as credits. The financial system supporting it is never discussed at length, and as the main characters typically have more than enough credits to do whatever they need to, the topic is never explored at very much length. But in season 2, episode 5, the set designers of the show decided to have a little fun inserting some cryptocurrencies into the mix.

In a scene where the characters are shopping for contraband technology and weapons, price tags for the items clearly have labels for several cryptocurrencies:

The Bitcoin logo in particular caused some conversation on twitter. Depending on how you tilt your head, it could either be a BTC or BSV logo.

The prices drawn up for the stickers were probably done without much thought, but the fictional prices of these contraband items is fun to think about. Gloves in the shot are worth 0.867 (either BTC or BSV) and 3,089 Litecoin. That would mean a current day price of between $210.57 and $193,309.62. Considering they are high tech, contraband gloves, it’s probably toward the higher end.

While this is all a bit of good fun based on the background of a fictional universe, BSV supporters will want to hope that the real Bitcoin becomes the credits of the universe, rather than the black market payment option.

This is the second time in just a few weeks that Bitcoin gets referenced by a significant piece of pop culture. The Simpsons also recently gave a cryptocurrency explainer, with an on screen gag noting they knew the real identity of Satoshi, but “we’re not telling.”

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Prof-it blockchain development team has come up with a new fork, Bitcoin Ultimatum (BTCU). This is under the support of one of the prominent players of cryptocurrency exchange called Coinsbit co-founded by Nikolai Udianskyi.

The developers are making efforts on improving the Bitcoin blockchain and introducing advanced technologies to help fix the key errors in the crypto community.

The concept designed for BTCU is a reflection of the second cryptocurrency by capitalization—Ethereum. To offer major functions for executing DAPP applications and transactions, BTCU has designed a concept that is highly similar to Ethereum. Its team is setting a possible chore in terms of building the direction of smart contracts and applying atomic swap technology to the blockchain protocol to enable transactions to interact with several other protocols. This execution would come up with a huge expansion in the technological sector.

BTCU is against implementation of classic mining. Ethereum developers usually own a positive approach with accounting for the goal of stopping the LPoS mining algorithm combined with PoA. The distributors and holders in the standard BTCU network would play the role of advisers whereas crypto exchange and blockchain companies would anticipate an optimistic balance over the master nodes. This decision was initiated to unload the network and avoid classics.

That is the reason its blockchain would depend on the PLoS mining algorithm associated with PoA, where PLoS will be put to use for mining by the users. When this fork is launched, an airdrop would be held for all users of the Bitcoin network to get airdrops in their wallets identical in BTCU network in ratio of 1:1 to the Bitcoin balance existing on branch block. After the branching all of the users will be able to find BTCU coins in their own network which would be balanced at the time of branching.

“The crypto community has become more & more erudite and is developing & growing every day, changing their point of view and perspective in favor of preservation of environment and using more of humane mining protocols,” says the development team.

The blockchain of the new cryptocurrency would require 20 holders. To prevent centralization and get control over the network, half of the holders will be selected by the team itself, and the second half will be determined by the community based on the PoA principle. They will be determined by 10 holders who holds the largest share of coin, who themselves can be holders of the master nodes. The PoA algorithm would be personalized and would diverge from the actual model. Transaction holders would be able to and it would be chosen by the cor-coin holders irrespective of changing their numbers.

Anonymity is the ultimate truth of any given blockchain network as it engrosses an individual with the absence of any commissions and mediators when crypto payments option is chosen over the classic

The BTCU experts adjoined the ability to perform confidential transfers within their own network to support its users to be anonymous while making transactions.

The PoA transaction verification protocol would allow developers to comprehend the blockchain throughput at level of 200 transactions recorded per-second up to the 10,000 transactions-per-second level. The BTCU blockchain would further permit the handling of smart conventions from having to look up for intermediaries to guarantee its user’s protection from scammers.

The BTCU plans to broaden and launch the concept of a decentralized mobile with multi-currency wallet along with its desktop version which would further facilitate sending and receiving crytocurrencies through one’s phone digits.

The BTCU’s nucleus squad plan to further advance and expand its merchandise to have universally recognizable solutions for crypto community. The world of blockchain applied science would always abide to be evenly relevant and the forecast is requisite to scrutinize whole industry’s updates and become more opportune every year.","In brief Blockchain-powered games are using non-fungible tokens and crypto to create in-game economies with digital assets.

Crypto's user experience still poses a challenge for mass adoption by gamers.

Decrypt spoke to developers from Ubisoft, Immutable, and CCP Games to get their thoughts on the future of blockchain gaming.

It was just over two years ago that Dapper Labs’ CryptoKitties exploded onto the scene, bogging down the Ethereum network while showing the potential for blockchain-driven gaming. Since then, many video games and interactive experiences have integrated crypto and blockchain, with more on the horizon.

Still, it feels like very early days for blockchain in gaming. While there are plenty of opportunities on the horizon and many interested parties working to bring those visions to life, there are also challenges and hurdles that could slow or even stifle the pace of innovation. What will be the blockchain game that breaks out into the mainstream… and will there even be one?

Decrypt interviewed a trio of game industry leaders to get their diverse takes on what’s next. We spoke with a VP from the developer of Gods Unchained, one of the biggest blockchain games to date, and the leader of blockchain initiatives at Ubisoft, one of the largest video game publishers on the planet. We also spoke to a game studio CEO who, while he’s personally immersed in the crypto space, has yet to integrate it in his flagship title, EVE Online.

This is where they see blockchain gaming going in the future.

Non-fungible tokens and the Internet of Assets

Using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it’s possible to create unique digital assets. That means it’s possible to create in-game objects such as trading cards and digital skins with a limited real-world supply; the technology famously underpinned the aforementioned CryptoKitties.

The ability to own these unique, scarce digital assets has been one of the biggest selling points to date for blockchain games. That’s likely to continue being a focus in the short-term, but as that core concept evolves and attaches to new types of games, we could see some truly consequential changes to interactive experiences.

“It’s difficult to predict how the industry will evolve. Some of the most exciting opportunities will come from the bridge blockchain creates between virtual and real-world economies,” says Tyler Perkins, VP of Marketing at Immutable, developer of collectible card-battler Gods Unchained. “Digital goods have always had strings attached, and free-market economies around these goods haven’t been possible because centralized entities have always had the option to intervene. As we begin to decentralize, many of the instruments, markets, and tools that exist around physical commodities will actualize in the digital realm.”

Ubisoft is the publisher of enormous game franchises such as Assassin’s Creed and Just Dance, but even a company of that scale has been on the frontlines of blockchain innovation in recent years. Ubisoft’s Entrepreneurs Lab accelerator provides resources and workspace to startups without taking equity; this year, it picked eight blockchain companies for the program. One of those startups, Planetarium, recently launched the public alpha for its blockchain-powered RPG, Nine Chronicles.

Ubisoft has also prototyped a Minecraft-esque game called HashCraft and helped found the Blockchain Game Alliance alongside processor manufacturer AMD and blockchain governance platform Maker. For Ubisoft, blockchain represents an opportunity to further empower players.

“Over the long term, the free use of digital assets might create new forms of interactions between players, community, and game developers,” explains Nicolas Pouard, Ubisoft’s Blockchain Initiative Director. “To us at Ubisoft, we see it as a way to allow players to become stakeholders of the games they love, at an unprecedented level.” He points to fantasy soccer game Sorare as an example of a successful blockchain game today—and it’s part of their Entrepreneurs Lab program. Enabling crypto startups today helps set Ubisoft up for the future, Pouard suggests.

We see blockchain as a way to allow players to become stakeholders of the games they love. Nicolas Pouard

“Blockchain is part of the technologies that are bringing new value propositions to users, in what we call the Internet of Assets,” says Pouard. “In the same way that the Web is the technology allowing Wikipedia, social media, and e-commerce, blockchain is the piece of a much larger picture that is currently being built by a number of actors and pioneering entrepreneurs,” says Pouard.

“The mindsets, cultures and standards of this new paradigm are invented now. Ubisoft always had an open innovation mindset and a strong partnership approach and—as with any new technology—we think that to make the most of it, it is all about collective effort,” he adds. “Empowering startups is the best way to support this effort, while keeping the pace of innovation, in order to be ready when the time comes.”

User experience is still a barrier for gamers

When it comes to challenges to widespread adoption of blockchain technology in games, we heard a common response: the difficulty of buying and interfacing with crypto.

For seasoned Decrypt readers, it may not seem difficult to set up a wallet and buy a little Bitcoin, but for many people, crypto remains a big question mark. What’s the value? What’s the point? Until there’s a much wider understanding of what crypto is and how to manage and manipulate it, the potential audience for such games could be rather small.

""I think the great challenge is that the overall addressable market of something that would be involved in interfacing with blockchain or cryptocurrency would be very small,” says Hilmar Veigar Pétursson, CEO of EVE Online developer CCP Games. “There's such a complexity barrier of interfacing with it, and there's such a barrier of understanding and trusting what is really going on that you ultimately end up with a niche of a niche. You end up with the intersection of people interested in games and interested in blockchain, and it's small.”

Although it has a complex in-game economy, EVE Online has yet to integrate crypto (Image: CCP Games)

Veigar Pétursson is personally invested in crypto and has experimented with blockchain technology in the past. However, CCP Games has yet to incorporate blockchain or crypto within EVE Online, a particularly hardcore massively multiplayer online space simulation with a complex in-game economy. While he believes that the technology could potentially help CCP deliver on its mission of “making virtual worlds more meaningful than real life,” he says that they haven’t heard many complaints from EVE players about having a centralized database and lacking true ownership of assets. “I think it's a little too early, because most players of games don't really care so much about that,” he adds.

What's a good way to do some amateur Bitcoin mining, mainly for learning more about it and crypto currencies/#blockchain over all. — Hilmar Veigar (@HilmarVeigar) January 19, 2017

“There’s still too much friction for new users in understanding blockchain technology and how to interact with it,” says Immutable’s Perkins. “Simply acquiring crypto proves to be a complicated process for beginners, and it’s often a high enough barrier for many to lose interest. We need to make the end-to-end process of interacting with digital assets so seamless that anybody can do it.”

Pouard affirms that need for seamless blockchain interactions, and says that the “regulatory framework should mature enough” in the meantime for such open asset economies to flourish. But in the short term, he says, it’s really all about making games that people want to play.

“The main short-term challenge is simply to build good games for players and not only for speculators,” says Pouard. “It’s important to find the right business model for a game, but it’s not the business model that brings fun to the players. We believe that the creation of stable coins will help a lot to [leave] the speculation behind us and focus on the true benefits of the tech, for the players.”

The tipping point for blockchain games?

When will blockchain gaming escape that so-called “niche of a niche” and become something that large numbers of players engage with? Will there be a tipping point?

“It’s important to remember that blockchain is still in its early days, and it might take a while before the benefits of the technology become tangible for our industry,” says Pouard. “Nonetheless, games like Sorare, Gods Unchained, or The Sandbox are proving that it is possible to offer rather similar experiences, in terms of concepts, to what larger game companies could do, which helps growing a player-base that benefits from blockchain features beyond the niche market.”

Veigar Pétursson suggests that it could be another five to 10 years before there’s a true breakout blockchain game, and that it may not be a game that is a huge hit upon release—it could be a slow-burning success that eventually becomes a sensation. ""I'm not sure necessarily that it will be a tipping point,” he says. “But you could foresee a time where there's a killer app, where you just really have to get involved regardless of whether you need to figure something out, and that pulls in a wave of people and kind of starts an avalanche.""

He points to the evolution of modern virtual reality, suggesting that lightsaber-swinging rhythm game Beat Saber is arguably VR’s killer app. Beat Saber has continually grown in visibility and popularity over the last couple years, but it has been eight years since the first Oculus Rift ushered in this era of VR technology. Could crypto gaming have a similar timeline before there’s a truly essential, must-play game that appeals to a wide segment of the gaming audience?

""Maybe if we start the clock at CryptoKitties—maybe 10 years after CryptoKitties you will be able to find something that is truly a killer app for crypto,” says Veigar Pétursson.

Maybe 10 years after CryptoKitties we’ll have something that is truly a killer app for crypto Hilmar Veigar Pétursson

Ultimately, as Ubisoft’s Pouard points out, blockchain and crypto are tools that can drive new and enticing experiences, but they’re not the experience itself. It’s up to developers to create brilliant games that use that technology to heighten and enhance that experience, rather than focusing on the tech above all.

“It is difficult to foresee a specific tipping point, I think things will evolve gradually,” he says. “We can assume that a huge IP using non-fungible tokens could potentially significantly increase the adoption. Yet, in the end, blockchain is a technology that we, world-creators, use to offer entertaining and memorable experiences to players—but what drives the industry is the success of amazing games.”",,
2020-03-08,"Cryptocurrency markets plunged following a plummet in oil prices and further sell-off in stocks.

The market capitalization or entire value of cryptocurrencies was down $26.43 billion from a day earlier at around 1:17 p.m. Singapore time, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com. The sell-off worsened as the day went on.

Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by value, fell over 10% in 24 hours at around the same time.

The violent sell-off in the cryptocurrency market comes after international oil benchmark Brent crude futures plummeted 30% to $31.02 per barrel, its lowest level since Feb. 2016. That was sparked by Saudi Arabia slashing its official selling prices for oil after OPEC failed to agree a deal on production cuts. This has led to fears of an oil price war. Brent has since pared some of its losses.","The Indian crypto ecosystem is celebrating the recent judgement by the Supreme Court (SC) in lifting the banking ban on cryptocurrency trading in the country. In place since April 2018 as per a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directive, the ban had crippled the crypto market in India. Many blockchain experts and crypto enthusiasts believe that the crypto and blockchain space will mushroom in the months to come with more startups and investors venturing into the ecosystem.

Sharing the excitement with Inc42, crypto exchange ThroughBit founder Abhishek Gopal said that the court took time but has come up with a positive decision. This, in a way, will have a ripple effect in the crypto ecosystem, where banks will allow transactions, and a lot of services around crypto would be launched.

In April 2018, RBI had virtually banned cryptocurrency trading in India. Post this, a lot of startups had shut shops and crypto enthusiasts lost a lot of money because of this decision. After the recent SC’s decision, RBI-recognised banks are now allowed to facilitate deals in cryptocurrencies. In other words, any customers can now legally buy, sell or transfer digital currencies.

But the RBI is not happy with the SC decision and is planning to file a review petition to curb cryptocurrency transactions in India. The regulator body said that it is concerned about the flaws which would come arise with cryptocurrency transactions. Further, it said that allowing cryptocurrency transactions will put the banking system at risk.

South Korea Legalises Cryptocurrency

Earlier this week, the South Korean government passed new legislation that is said to provide a framework for the regulation and legalisation of cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges. Accordingly, it passed an amendment to the country’s financial services to review the niche industry for any flaws, gaps and use of specific financial information.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in will pass and presume the new cryptocurrency law, which is followed by a months-long rulemaking process that is said to provide enough time for exiting startups and exchanges to transition into the law’s new regulatory framework.

Sooner or later, you may be blocked out of your bank account. It can happen to any of us, and it can even happen with supposedly crypto-friendly “banks,” such as Bitwala, Revolut, and more.

The question is: what should you do if such a company freezes or blocks your account? Well, according to lawyers, there isn't any legal 'magic bullet' you can use that will successfully get your account reopened.

Still, at the very least, you can seek to contact and cooperate with your company as fully as possible, assuming that they've frozen your account in order to carry out KYC (know your customer) or AML (anti-money laundering) checks. And in a worst-case scenario, you can always contact the financial regulator of the country where you and the bank are located.

Desperate clients

Complaints from people being locked out of their bank accounts are surprisingly common. Basically, if you tend to dabble in cryptocurrency trading or crypto-related business, and if you use a bank that accepts your custom as a 'crypto person,' you seem to be at greater risk of having your account blocked or frozen.

For example, the Berlin-based crypto startup Bitwala that provides German bank (solarisBank) accounts, is also being criticized for account-blocking on Reddit. Here's Reddit user ""pibyk"" writing on the Bitwala sub-Reddit a couple of months ago:

""I consider myself to be sort of lucky as my account got blocked for no valid reason before I put anything in it. So there is nothing to recover and no hassle to get the money back. The message I got was meaningless, and their customer service failed to respond in any reasonable time. As far as I am concerned this action constitutes a serious breach of trust, so I am no longer interested in such an unreliable service.""

This kind of problem isn't exclusive to Bitwala. Another reportedly 'crypto-friendly' bank – the UK-based Revolut – has also received a number of Reddit complaints, including this one:

""All my money is locked in my revolut account, I can’t even buy a bottle of water because i got no cash on me and these jerks are ignoring me for no reason. Please help me get in touch with them, I’m desperate.""

In other words, the problem is a general one, and similar complaints can be found for Wirex, Barclays, ING, Fidor, and Simple Bank, among others.

‘The quickest and cheapest strategy’

Legally, what can a customer do if their account is frozen by their bank? In terms of taking specific legal actions, the disappointing answer to this question is: nothing.

""Clearly, any answer is case specific and depends on where the bank and customer are based,"" says James Kaufmann, a lawyer specialized in blockchain and cryptocurrency at Howard Kennedy. ""But in a general context, as I see it, if a bank blocks an account because it feels it is appropriate to carry out further AML/KYC checks (and bear in mind that source of funds and wealth are things that need to be considered here), there is little that a customer can achieve effectively and reasonably by resorting to legal action to force the bank to release those funds.""

Still, Kaufmann advises that customers take the practical step of contacting their bank wherever possible and of cooperating with them to get the account back online.

""In my experience, the better course of action is to find a friendly and engaged contact at the relevant bank and seek to work with them to help them conclude their process as soon as possible,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""This is usually the quickest, cheapest and most effective strategy. Legal action will be time-consuming, costly, labor intensive and there is limited likelihood of success unless the bank is wilfully refusing to release funds or not following a reasonable and appropriate procedure.""

But yes, assuming that the bank is wilfully refusing to release funds and has no legal grounds for doing so, then legal action may very well be viable. Felix Shipkevich is a lawyer with Shipkevich in New York, and he tells Cryptonews.com that contacting the regulator is your best bet.

""If the cryptocurrency exchange is regulated, customers who are unable to withdraw their funds should immediately contact the regulator where their account is papered,"" he says.

Given that banks are also regulated, much the same applies if your bank is preventing you from withdrawing your money.

But Shipkevich adds, if the company is not regulated, “then contacting law enforcement authorities should be the next best action. Unfortunately, civil legal actions may not be successful, particularly if prosecuting and enforcing judgments are likely to be challenging.""

It almost goes without saying, but it's never a good idea to deal with an unregulated bank, so it's unlikely that most people will ever find themselves in such a situation. Still, contacting the relevant financial regulator and asking for advice, in cases where your bank is being consistently unhelpful, is usually a good idea.

And in the end, even if you end up having your account unfrozen, it also might be a good idea to switch banks. Assuming that you can find one with a better reputation for treating customers who deal with cryptocurrency more fairly. In the meantime, let’s hope that hyperbitcoinization will arrive sooner than expected, removing all middlemen who can control your money.","Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto? An Introduction to Bitcoin's Mysterious Founder

The true identity of the creator of Bitcoin is one of the biggest mysteries in the modern world. Over the years many theories have popped up about who Satoshi Nakamoto really is, including a time traveler, a space alien, a rogue artificial intelligence or a front for groups such as the NSA, CIA and Yakuza. This article will present only the known facts about him and the more likely candidates who people suspect may be be the elusive figure.

Who Is the Mysterious Founder of Bitcoin?

The name Satoshi Nakamoto is an alias used by the person or entity who created Bitcoin to hide their true identity. He claims to be Japanese, born on April 5, 1975 and reside in Japan but people doubt this due to his native-level command of the English language as well as his preference of working hours more consistent with the U.K. time zone than Asia. Satoshi is a Japanese boy’s name that means “one with wise ancestry” and he is presumed to be male.

Nakamoto was the first to solve the double-spending problem for a decentralized digital currency, creating a new asset, the like of which the world had never seen before: Bitcoin. In October 2008, Satoshi published the original whitepaper, describing his blueprint for a “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” In January 2009 he released version 0.1 of the source code and launched the cryptocurrency by mining the genesis block. The founder continued to work on the software project for about another year and a half before disengaging from active development.

Nobody knows why Satoshi Nakamoto really decided to disappear without ever revealing himself or even cashing out some of the billions of dollars his early minted coins are now worth. This has provided fertile ground for speculation, educated guesses and outright conspiracy theories. Researchers have pored over the few data points left by the mysterious figure, trying to analyze his vocabulary, his way of writing and other clues to find some hints to his true identity.

Let’s have a look at some of the names that have been put forward as possible Satoshis.

Will the Real Satoshi Nakamoto Please Stand Up

Dorian Nakamoto is the man with the friendly face most people now associate with the creator of Bitcoin. He was outed as Satoshi in March 2014 by Newsweek Magazine, which created a media frenzy around him and greatly disrupted his life. Dorian has denied having any connection to the development of cryptocurrency but eventually embraced a role of a mascot of sorts for the community.

The evidence cited by the magazine includes the fact that Dorian was actually born with the name Satoshi. He was trained as a physicist at Cal Poly University and worked as a systems engineer on classified defense projects and as a computer engineer for technology and financial information services companies. Nakamoto also has libertarian tendencies and encouraged his daughter to have a business “not under the government’s thumb.” And when he was first asked about Bitcoin, Nakamoto mistakenly thought it was a question about one of the classified projects he did for U.S. military contractors and said: “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.” For a more detailed look at Dorian as Satoshi Nakamoto read this.

Hal Finney was a cryptographic pioneer, cypherpunk activist and the first person ever to receive a bitcoin transaction. Coincidentally or not, he also was a neighbor of Dorian Nakamoto. A Caltech engineering graduate and a developer for the PGP Corporation, he had the required skills to create a cryptocurrency from scratch and was the first person to improve the Bitcoin source code after Satoshi.

Finney died in August 2014 and was cryopreserved by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. Hopefully one day the technology to revive him will be invented and he can provide more clarity on the issue if it has not been resolved by then. For now you can read up on the many facts pointing to Hal being Satoshi here.

Nick Szabo, self-described “Blockchain, cryptocurrency, and smart contracts pioneer,” was in contact with Hal Finney, and his name often comes up as a possible Satoshi despite his claims otherwise. People who think he may be the creator of Bitcoin point out his proposal for a decentralized currency called bit gold from 2005 which uses similar concepts to those eventually perfected by Bitcoin. For a breakdown of the facts pointing to Nick Szabo being Satoshi read this article. However, there are also many arguments against Szabo as Satoshi.

Craig Wright is mostly thought of as a conman these days but there was once a time when some of the most prominent names in the crypto community thought he was Satoshi. This abrasive character is an Australian academic and businessman who first emerged in December 2015 with reports in Wired and Gizmodo. Since then he tried to force people to accept him as the creator of Bitcoin in various unconvincing ways, such as lawsuits against his critics. For the latest developments in the Craig Wright claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto saga see here.

Paul Le Roux is a much scarier Satoshi candidate who came to light from the legal cases around Wright. Le Roux is a former encryption software programmer and vicious cartel boss turned informant to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. After he was arrested in September 2012 for conspiracy to import narcotics, the criminal mastermind admitted to participating in seven murders. See this link for more on why Satoshi Nakamoto could be Paul Le Roux.

Other less discussed possible Satoshi candidates include cypherpunk pioneer Ian Grigg, Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki and tech mogul Elon Musk.

Bitcoin is *not* my safe word — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 10, 2020

Elon Musk is mainly involved in the cryptocurrency sphere as a meme lord and casual troll, but he too had to deny being the creator of Bitcoin. As the founder of Paypal, Tesla, Spacex and a multitude of other companies in different fields, Musk probably has the ability to learn whatever skills he needs to create a cryptocurrency from scratch.

In November 2017 a former intern at Musk’s rocket company by the name of Sahil Gupta presented the case that his old boss was really the founder of Bitcoin. A Yale University computer science student at the time, he claimed that Musk had both a preference and an excellent grasp of the C++ programming language like Satoshi did.

Gupta also pointed out that the stability of the financial system was a major global concern in 2008, and Musk is someone who “identifies the most urgent problems of our time and dedicates his time to solving them,” suggesting he had the drive “to solve the lack of trust in banks by creating a currency that doesn’t need them.” He also claimed the tech mogul had a deep understanding of economics and cryptography needed to write the Bitcoin whitepaper.

Musk, who is already a billionaire many times over thanks to Paypal and Tesla, also wouldn’t be tempted to cash out his old coins in a hurry. But the massive stash of BTC and BCH could be used to kickstart the Martian economy once he is out of reach of the IRS on the surface of the red plant. So perhaps he is Satoshi after all and is just using humor to misdirect?

You can now set aside some of your crypto assets to earn interest. In other words, ZenGo now also acts like a savings account.

The company has partnered with two DeFi projects for the new feature. DeFi means “decentralized finance,” and it has been a hot trend in the cryptocurrency space. DeFi projects are the blockchain equivalent of traditional financial products. For instance, you can lend and borrow money, invest in derivative assets and more.

If you want to learn more about DeFi, here’s an article I wrote on the subject:

But let’s come back to ZenGo. When you have crypto assets in your ZenGo wallet, you can now open the savings tab, pick an asset, such as Dai, and select what percentage of your holdings you want to set aside.

After that, all you have to do is wait. You get an overview of your savings “accounts” at any time. This way, you can see your total earned interests. Interests are automatically reinvested over time. You can move your money from those DeFi projects back to your wallet whenever you want.

Behind the scene, ZenGo uses the Compound protocol, a lending DeFi project. It works a bit like LendingClub, but on the blockchain. Some users send money to Compound to contribute to liquidity pools. Other users borrow money from that pool.

Interest rates go up and down depending on supply and demand. That’s why you currently earn more interests when you inject DAI or USD Coin in Compound. But that could change over time.

ZenGo also uses Figment in order to stake Tezos. This time, it isn’t a lending marketplace. When you lock some money in a staking project, it means that you support the operations of a particular blockchain. Few blockchains support staking as they need to be based on proof-of-stake.

For the end user, it looks like a savings account whether you’re relying on Compound or Figment. There are other wallet apps that let you access DeFi projects, such as Coinbase Wallet and Argent. But ZenGo thinks they’re still too complicated for regular users.","Is Twitter Helping Justin Sun and Other Cryptocurrency Celebrities Defraud?

A site as hugely influential as Twitter should ideally take a balanced and responsible approach when suggesting blue check accounts and other popular influencers to follow in the crypto space. Fact is, this couldn’t be further from the reality: Twitter seems to constantly promote the same narrow selection of accounts to follow, some of whom are arguably massive scammers trying desperately to pump their own bags. This begs the question: is Twitter actively helping favored accounts while stifling the reach of others?

The Same, Tired Selection

One might imagine that figures as controversial as Tron founder Justin Sun — who is recently under fire for what many view as the hostile takeover of crypto blogging platform Steemit — might be handled with care by social media platforms like Twitter. Especially after numerous allegations of scamming, false claims, buying followers, and shameless promo after shameless promo.

Whether it be suspiciously claiming to be CEO of a Chinese language homophone of “ripple” when Ripple company officials themselves deny connection, big talk of partnerships that don’t materialize, or riding the back of tragedy and sickness to promote the copy-pasta-whitepapered clone coin TRX, Sun is no stranger to suspicious cringe shilling and criticism.

Why, after all this, does Twitter continue to promote Sun like the second coming of Satoshi in its follow suggestions? For that matter, it stands to ask why other questionable influencers are made so prominent on the site as well, when they seem to be doing little more than advertising for their own crypto products, many of which have yet to be tested or vetted fully for viability.

Twitter’s restrictive official stance on business ads for crypto can be found here. Not that there is anything wrong with pushing one’s product, but when other accounts can be easily shadowbanned and suspended for seeming lesser allegations, eyebrows do begin to raise.

Twitter’s Algorithms and Follow Suggestions

Twitter has come under scrutiny for its algorithms previously, with CEO Jack Dorsey stating before U.S. lawmakers in 2018 that they had been used by the company “unfairly,” but that the issue had been rectified.

A BBC report detailed that users of the platform began to notice relevant tweets were no longer appearing in searches. Dorsey stated that myriad signals were used to choose “what to show, down-rank and filter” and that although the company doesn’t shadowban accounts based on politics, some mistakes were made and accounts had been treated in an unfair manner.

As for follow suggestions, Twitter lists multiple factors that supposedly go in to determining what a given user sees, including contact uploads, user location, Twitter activity and interactions, and info from third-party websites.

This all sounds well and good, but why are some accounts suspended or ejected from the platform, while others who seem guilty of mis-informational and spammy abuses, continue to thrive? Even though crypto ads are strictly regulated on the site, influencers like Sun, CZ of Binance, and others seem to be able to weave through this net, shilling their own crypto products to millions of followers with impunity. While many crypto users of libertarian bent might wish to make Twitter much more deregulated, decentralized and “Wild West,” if you will (author included), the seeming lack of consistency is strange.

Sitting at the Popular Kids’ Table With Jack

It’s a bit presumptive on its face to say that all of this is happening because of money and unofficial alliances, but let’s be honest: this is probably happening because of money and unofficial alliances. A site becoming huge does not make it exempt from the natural consequences of human nature; if anything, the problem is exacerbated.

Even employees of a small town gas station, for example, will conspire to stiff a new guy out of the best shift when he’s not there. One can only imagine how things get at the major-leagues level of multi-billion dollar empires. To assume conspiracy doesn’t happen at this tier would be naive, to say the least. This is social media. More engagement translates into more revenue, and more “extreme” and enticing posts related to arguments about politics and getting rich quick with crypto stimulate engagement.

Besides, former Twitter employees have admitted such conspiracy goes on, even if it has been somewhat heavily spun by so-called conservative media. Controversial activist James O’Keefe presented video in 2018 of a former Twitter engineer saying:

One strategy is to shadow ban so that you have ultimate control. The idea of a shadow ban is that you ban someone but they don’t know they’ve been banned, because they keep posting, but no one sees their content … I don’t know if Twitter does this anymore.

While left-leaning media tried to downplay O’Keefe’s hidden video, it nonetheless is troubling.

Nobody’s Business but Twitter’s

Principled bitcoiners don’t want the government to leverage legislative force on ol’ Jack or Justin, and shape Twitter into a perfectly boring and “fair” Communistic platform where there can be no bias. After all, it’s a business, at the end of the day, and the business can do as it pleases. Besides, whether someone is a scammer or not is often debatable. It’s no secret there are alliances and bitter divisions in the crypto world with each camp calling the other shitcoin peddlers. In fact, such divisions are obvious to the point of Dorsey himself helping to perpetuate them:

It’s really no surprise then that some in the Bitcoin Cash community suspect targeted censorship as well. When a BTC maximalist is CEO, of a company whose former employees say shadowbanning was practiced, and accounts seem to be deleted, shadowed, or axed at random, it’s awful hard not to start connecting dots. The controversy surrounding reports of the @Bitcoin handle being sold last year to a BTC maximalist also fueled this fire, as the sale of accounts is prohibited by Twitter’s Terms of Service.

I finally reached out to Jack on Twitter to ask why Sun and others seem so universally pushed on his platform’s users, but at the time of writing haven’t gotten a response. Until there is more clarity, it looks like the garish glare of Sun and his ilk will go on trying to blindside folks, but it’s doubtful Twitter denizens will go elsewhere to interact. After all, no one can deny it’s entertaining, and that means sure success for any social media platform.

Let me tell you about a lovely dream. In some utopian future, all assets will be represented as tokens on blockchains. Everyone will issue their own tokens, backed by their own assets. And because those tokens are backed by assets and their ownership is transparently recorded on an immutable decentralized blockchain, everyone will accept everyone else’s token as money. There will be no need for trusted central institutions to issue money. In the new world of tokens and blockchains, private asset-backed money will be ubiquitous, and everyone will be their own bank.

Currently, the principal use of asset-backed tokens is to make illiquid things liquid. Say you have a stash of something valuable but difficult to transport. Twelve-foot steel girders, for example. You put up an advertisement on Craigslist saying, “Steel girders for sale, buyer collects” and you wait. For a long time.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The problem is this transaction suffers from “coincidence of wants.” Storing girders takes up space, as you know (because your garage is full of them). And there isn’t much of an investment market for girders. So the only people who are likely to want to buy your girders are people who have an immediate use for them and – importantly – can transport them. You might get lucky – there could be a local builder who needs some steel girders for a project. But if buyers have to come some distance, they might not bother. After all, you probably aren’t the only person in the country offering steel girders for sale at a hefty discount.

But suppose, instead of selling your girders, you decide to monetize your stash. Steel girders are rather good things to monetize because they don’t decay, they aren’t appetizing for rats and mice, they can survive some fires and floods, and they are “fungible,” which means one girder is indistinguishable from another. So you create a token – a stablecoin – linked to girders: one token represents one girder. To market the token, you set up a fancy website, publish a white paper using stuff you found on the internet and issue a bunch of press releases saying GirderCoin is the money of the future and early adopters will be billionaires. Don’t miss out, buy some now!

Humans have been monetizing assets in this way since time immemorial. Representations of valuable objects are far easier to trade than the objects themselves, and they have at times been used as money. They also make it possible for delicate objects to be kept in controlled storage: Cans of vintage sardines, for example, which require climate-controlled conditions and careful management if they are to age properly.

But trading representations of objects rather than the objects themselves creates an opportunity for fraud. If GirderCoin takes off – and many coins of this type do take off, at least for a short while – you will rake in a lot of money without physically delivering your girders. Of course, your girders now belong to other people and their ownership is permanently and transparently recorded on a blockchain. But “possession is nine-tenths of the law,” as they say. So when a local builder turns up at your door saying, “Hey, man, I need some girders,” you do a deal, don’t you? You sell some of the girders to the builder for cash. GirderCoin still exists – in fact, it’s doing rather well – but it is no longer backed one-for-one by real girders. It is now “fractionally reserved.” Banks, of course, have been doing this for centuries.

The cost of reliably linking tokens to real assets inevitably drives the market towards consolidation, oligopoly and even monopoly.

But you now have a problem. If a GirderCoin holder actually tries to collect their girders, you haven’t got them. Fortunately, as previously mentioned, steel girders are fungible: Token ownership confers the right to claim “a” girder, but not any specific girder. And you’ve sensibly put a clause in GirderCoin’s terms and conditions saying that anyone who wants to collect their girders must give three days’ notice. So if anyone does try to claim their girders, you have three days to obtain them. Unless you are lucky enough to find a handy advert on Craigslist, you will have to buy them at full price from a steel supplier. It might be more convenient, though less honest, simply to disappear.

Recording changes of ownership of a real asset on a blockchain doesn’t eliminate fraud. If you buy a token backed by a real asset you don’t physically hold, how do you know that real asset exists? The blockchain will tell you who owns the real asset but it won’t tell you where it is. What is on the blockchain, and what is present in reality, could be very different.

Asset-backed token issuers typically try to instill confidence by promising periodic audits. You, GirderCoin issuer, might promise that your girder stock will be audited every six months. SardineCoin’s issuer promises exactly this. But there’s still a trust problem, isn’t there? Who will conduct this audit and why should anyone believe their findings – especially as they are being paid to say everything is fine? Maintaining permanent open house for GirderCoin holders so they can inspect the girder stocks whenever they want might mitigate the trust problem, though only if they know the total number of girders, not just their own holding – and, of course, as the garage is full to the roof with girders, counting them might be a bit of a problem. So you get your friend who is an accountant to certify you have the right number of girders and you put the certificate on your website to convince punters you are honest. Seriously, this is what token issuers do.

There are other things you could do to reassure coin holders that you are not fractionally-reserving their girders. You could set up GirderCam – 24-hour surveillance of your girder store – and make it publicly available on the internet. People do this for kittens, after all. Or you could affix a GPS tracker to every girder, so that its movements can be tracked. Micro-chipping steel girders sounds a bit advanced, but with the Internet of Things, all things are possible … at a price. Though microchipping sardines in their cans, or wine in its bottle, seems too complicated even for the Internet of Things. There is always the risk the custodian eats the sardines and drinks the wine, then disappears leaving a garage full of empty sardine cans and wine bottles, all reassuringly microchipped.

Convincing punters you are not out to rip them off is expensive. For a small retail girder seller, it’s all a bit much. After all, this was supposed to be an easy way of making money.

If you are honest, your exit strategy from all this expense is to look for a buyer. Economies of scale being what they are, large commercial outfits are much better able to bear these expenses than people selling stuff out of their garages. And they want to corner the market if they can. Closing down little cottage industries like yours is in their interests. So when a large commercial outfit offers to buy up all GirderCoins and absorb them into its GirderFund, you will accept with considerable relief. GirderFund will make GirderCoin holders an offer they can’t refuse, move the girders to their own storage and you will put your car in your garage for the first time in years – after dismantling all the surveillance gear, of course. After all, you don’t want the whole world looking at your car in its garage while you are enjoying a well-earned holiday in the sun.

The dream of tokenizing all assets, enabling people to issue their own coins and have them accepted as money, founders on the problem of trust. By definition, physical assets are not decentralized. Your girder stash is yours until you monetize it, but once you monetize it, you become custodian for other people’s girders. You need substantial infrastructure and a flawless reputation for them to trust you enough to accept your coin, even to hold as an investment. For tokens to be widely accepted as money requires even more trust. And if you don’t want to be responsible for looking after other people’s property, then we are back to “buyer collects.” Paradoxically, decentralizing physical assets destroys the whole point of asset-backed tokens.

The cost of reliably linking tokens to real assets inevitably drives the market towards consolidation, oligopoly and even monopoly. Of course, people could back their tokens with decentralized digital assets. But investing in digital assets so you can issue a digital asset of your own is a long way from simply monetizing whatever is lying around in your garage. Why would anyone bother to do this?",,
2020-03-09,"Bitcoin has plunged to two-month lows since Sunday, possibly due to an over-$100 million liquidation by PlusToken scammers, analysts say.

The top cryptocurrency fell by nearly 10 percent from $8,900 to $8,000 on Sunday to register its single-biggest daily decline since September 2019, according to Bitstamp data. Then on Monday, bitcoin (BTC) slipped further to two-month lows below $7,700 during the Asian trading hours.

At press time, the cryptocurrency’s global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, has recovered somewhat to $7,925.

While the sudden price drop has taken place alongside a bloody day in the traditional markets, there may be another factor driving down bitcoin’s value so severely.

“The sudden drop in prices seems to arise out of the selling of BTC by PlusToken,” Ashish Singhal, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.co told CoinDesk.

On Saturday, scammers in control of the remaining wallets of the China-based Ponzi scheme moved 13,000 BTC (worth around $101 million currently, but close to $120 million at the time) to so-called “mixers” and may have offloaded their holdings, causing prices to fall sharply, according to Singhal. Mixers are used to obfuscate the source of a crypto transaction by outputting batches with different coins than are sent in.

PlusToken had posed as a cryptocurrency wallet and swindled investors out of possibly as much as $2 billion in cryptocurrency by promising rewards. While six of its masterminds were arrested in June 2019, the authorities could not seize 180,000 BTC, 6,400,000 ether (ETH) and 111,000 tether (USDT), which were sent from scam victims to PlusToken wallets, according to Chainalysis.

Trader Kevin Svenson has also associated the latest price drop with PlusToken holdings being dumped into the market.

People in control of the PlusToken wallets have been liquidating their stolen bitcoins since August and likely played a big role in pushing bitcoin down from $12,000 to $6,500 in the four months to November. as noted by Ergo Research at the time.

Back in December, the scammers still controlled 20,000 bitcoins, of which, 13,000 look to have been moved for liquidation over the weekend.

The onchain activity on Saturday was again noted by Ergo Research:

Macros or scam?

Some, of course, may argue that moving coins to mixers does not necessarily result in liquidation and the sell-off seen from Sunday was caused by the coronavirus-led crash in the global financial markets.

Indeed, negative global macro factors – such as the equity market sell-off and record low in the U.S. government bond yield – may have also played a role in pushing bitcoin lower, as noted by popular analyst Jacob Canfield.

Still, a major PlusToken liquidation could well have weighed heavy over bitcoin’s price if it did occur. The cryptocurrency was trading steadily above $9,000 on Saturday as the scammed coins were being moved to mixers and fell sharply the following day. Further, traditional markets were closed over the weekend.

Canfield too listed a PlusToken dump as one of the factors possibly responsible for bitcoin’s price drop.

Chart view

So how did bitcoin’s price drop look from a technical perspective?

“Bitcoin needed higher prices on the 4-hour chart to get itself into a neutral stance between $9,200-$9,600,” popular Twitter analyst Mr. Anderson told CoinDesk.

“Once that battle was lost it left the 12-hour chart in an ugly position as well and things snowballed quickly,” Anderson said.

Daily chart

In the aftermath, the head-and-shoulders breakdown, a bearish reversal pattern, seen on the daily chart suggests the rally from December lows near $6,400 has ended and the bears have regained control.

The bias will remain bearish as long as prices are holding below the former support-turned-resistance of the neckline, currently placed at $8,450.

A bullish reversal now requires a convincing UTC close above the March 7 high of $9,213. That would invalidate the lower-highs setup.","Wilsons Auctions, an Ireland-based auction house, announced on Friday that it would initiate the selling of €110,000 (around $125,000) in cryptocurrencies on behalf of the Belgian federal government.

As detailed by the auction house, the online auction will commence on March 24 at 12:00 (GMT) and will run for 24 hours. The auction will be unreserved, meaning the auction house will not set a minimum limit for bids.

All the digital currencies were confiscated by the Belgian government and include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Gold.

To attract retail buyers, the auction house will split Bitcoins across lots ranging from 0.25 to 1 Bitcoin, while other cryptocurrency lots will have a higher number of tokens.

Conducted by the Dublin-based entity of the auction house, there is a deposit of €500 (almost $571) registration deposit for buyers willing to participate in the auction.

“Wilsons Auctions is delighted to be holding its next auction of seized bitcoin, even more so because this will be the first of its kind in Ireland,” Mark Woods, asset recovery executive at Wilsons Auctions, said.

A transparent way of liquidation

The auction house also conducted multiple similar auctions for the Belgian government last year. Then, it sold Bitcoin and Monero, also providing storage facilities for the seized digital currencies.

“The format has proven popular with our customers, who are able to bid online and purchase cryptocurrency from an established and trusted auction house instead of utilizing online exchanges, which can be a risky and daunting process,” Woods added.

He also believes that the auction process will provide a “level playing field” to both novices and experienced participating investors.

According to Kraken, its growth in India was hampered by the ban on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, they did not give further details regarding the plans for this large market.

Future is bright for the Indian market

Sunny Ray, Head of Global Business Development at Kraken, said the following regarding the decision of the Indian Supreme Court:

“This is an incredibly emotional moment for India. Satoshi created Bitcoin because he felt that central banks were inefficient. The fact that the crypto industry just battled, and won, against the central bank located in the second-most populous country in the world is a massive achievement. We fought for 1.5 billion people to have the right to access crypto.”

Following the same line, the exchange stated that the future is bright in terms of the Indian market and said they hope to give more updates on this new commitment they have acquired with users of the second-most populous country in the world.

Cointelegraph reached out to Kraken for additional details but received no response as of press time. This article will be updated accordingly should a response come in.

Other exchanges also have their eyes on India

Similarly, Binance made a major move into Indian’s crypto market on November 2019. The firm acquired local crypto exchange WazirX, allowing users to buy and sell crypto with Indian rupees (INR).

Cointelegraph previously reported the intentions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to appeal against the decision taken by the Supreme Court, claiming that cryptocurrency trading poses a risk to the banking system.

However, the court had ruled that the RBI had not provided sufficient evidence that the assertion was true.","A United States congressman is the latest working to clarify and determine which U.S. regulator is responsible for which digital assets.

On March 9, Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) introduced the “Crypto-Currency Act of 2020,” a bill that looks to choreograph a wide range of digital assets to answer to the appropriate regulator.

The proposed regulatory schema

As Will Stechschulte, Gosar’s legislative assistant, explained to Cointelegraph, “the bill looks to provide not only clarity, but legitimacy to crypto assets in the United States.”

Gosar’s proposal divides digital assets into three categories: crypto-commodity, crypto-currency and crypto-security. Respectively, the three categories would be governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Secretary of the Treasury via the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Interestingly, the language of the bill would seem to cement the status of digital assets like Bitcoin as crypto-commodities rather than crypto-currencies. The classification of “crypto-currency” reads “representations of United States currency or synthetic derivatives” — more reminiscent of stablecoins like Tether (USDT).

The language behind crypto-securities, remains familiar: “all debt, equity, and derivative instruments that rest on a blockchain or decentralized cryptographic ledger.”

As to non-fungible tokens, the bill makes no mention.

Updates to the bill since December

The bill is an updated version of one that first leaked in December. The updated bill features expanded definitions for terms like “Decentralized cryptographic ledger” and “Smart contract” — concepts that U.S. legislators are struggling to cope with.

Possibly more significantly, the updated bill is more explicit about determining “primary” rather than “sole” regulatory responsibility. The exact implications remain to be seen, but the change could weaken the legal standing of crypto businesses arguing that, say, the SEC has no right to regulate them.

Industry stakeholder involvement in drafting

Breaking with typical congressional practice, Gosar is presenting the bill solo, without a co-sponsor. Stechschulte told Cointelegraph that “For introduction, it’s just going to be Congressman Gosar. [...] After introduction, we’re hoping to garner some serious support.”

Communications Director for Gosar Ben Goldey explained the emphasis on industry engagement before legislative approval

“Since this is such a niche issue, we worked with stakeholders and outside groups/experts to get a good sense of the kind of clarity that the industry needed. We chose to gather stakeholder support before working toward cosponsors.”

One of the industry players involved in drafting the bill was pioneer Bitcoin investor Erik Finman.

Speaking with Cointelegraph, Finman said he had initially approached Gosar’s team to work on such a bill because “I like that they’re brave and will stand strong for anything.”

Regarding the bill’s history and development from the version that came out in December, Finman said that a number of participants had weighed in:

“That bill that leaked, we were experimenting with a couple of things, that was our second draft. We’re thirty-two versions away from that.”

Related legislation

The past year has seen a number of new draft bills, especially in response to Facebook’s white paper for Libra. Fears of facing regulation by the SEC probably contributed to changes to Libra’s initial vision of a managed stablecoin based on a “basket of currencies.”

The nearest peer to Gosar’s new bill is, however, Warren Davidson’s (R-OH) Token Taxonomy Act, initially introduced in 2018 and later updated and re-introduced in April 2019.

Finman, for one, felt that the Token Taxonomy Act had stalled out. He also said of the new Crypto-currency Act that “I think this is slightly bigger in scope.”","Amid countries increasingly auctioning Bitcoin (BTC) seized in law enforcement actions, some jurisdictions are fighting for authorization to confiscate crypto.

A state authority in Belarus wants lawmakers to authorize them to seize cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from criminals. The Investigative Committee of the Republic of Belarus, a centralized system of state law enforcement agencies, is purportedly planning to back a legal initiative that would grant them the authority to confiscate crypto.

Belarus now has legal regulation that allows the Investigative Committee to seize crypto

Ivan Noskevich, head of the Investigative Committee, publicly voiced the initiative in a March 9 interview with Belarusian state-owned TV channel CTV. According to the executive, Belarus has had no legal regulation that would allow the authority to seize cryptocurrency through enforcement actions to date.

According to the official, the Committee has been encountering problems while investigating criminal cases involving cryptocurrencies as part of the offense. As such, the Investigative Committee has proposed to amend the existing criminal procedure law to allow the authority to seize crypto in such cases. Additionally, Noskevich believes that the authority should be able to confiscate crypto from actors who used it in crimes motivated by profit.

The authority hopes to amend existing criminal procedure law

Noskevich further expressed hope that lawmakers in Belarus would respect the stance of the Investigative Committee and will put necessary amendments into the existing criminal procedure law. He said:

“We’ve encountered such cases before, but there was no legal regulation of the mechanism for seizing cryptocurrency. I hope that the legislators will listen to the opinion of the Investigative Committee, and such amendments will be introduced into the criminal procedure legislation.”

Cointelegraph has contacted the Investigative Committee for additional information but did not receive an immediate response. This story will be updated should they respond.

Although Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko reportedly legalized cryptocurrencies in the country back in 2017, Belarus doesn’t appear to have been very active in terms of crypto-related developments to date. Among the latest crypto news from the country, Belarus’ general prosecutor raised concerns over the role of crypto in tax evasion in June 2019. Previously, Belarus’ largest bank, Belarusbank, was reported to be considering setting up a cryptocurrency exchange.

Other jurisdictions worldwide actively seizing crypto from crimes

While the Investigative Committee is fighting to become authorized to confiscate crypto, a number of countries worldwide have been putting seized cryptocurrencies on auction as part of a common practice. As such, the Belgian Federal government plans to auction $125,000 worth of Bitcoin on March 24, 2020. As reported, the United States Marshals Service sold a total amount of 185,230 bitcoins confiscated during its enforcement operations.

However, some jurisdictions are not quite sure what to do with seized cryptocurrencies. On Feb. 25, Cointelegraph reported on Finnish Customs deliberating about what to do with 1,666 Bitcoins seized from drug criminals years ago. The authority purportedly doesn’t want to auction the confiscated Bitcoin because the cryptocurrency could be returned to the hands of criminals.","For those unfamiliar with the term, a “Bitcoin Faucet” is usually used as an incentive in software that wants your attention. Complete a captcha or look at and advertisement and you get one millionth of a BTC, that sort of thing. You’re never going to get rich off of one of them, but most people aren’t going to turn down free money either. The latest project from [TJ Bruno] follows that same concept and brings it into the physical world. But you still aren’t going to get rich off of it.

The hardware used for this corporeal Bitcoin Faucet is pretty simple. All you need is a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, and a 2.8″ touch LCD. Naturally you could use a larger screen if you wanted, but then it wouldn’t fit inside of the very slick 3D printed stand that [TJ] developed. We might consider upgrading to a slightly speedier Pi though, in the demonstration video it looks like the Zero is struggling pretty hard to handle the GUI.

Using the Faucet is straightforward enough. You tap the screen and place a QR code representing your Bitcoin wallet on the device’s tray, where it’s scanned by the camera. In a few seconds the Faucet shows a QR code on its own screen that will point your phone’s browser to the transaction details so you can verify your digital coinage is on the way.

You might be wondering why you’d want to have a device that sits there waiting to pay out fractions of a BTC to anyone who’s willing to flash their wallet at it. We’re not entirely sure, though it might make for an interesting way to raise awareness about cryptocurrency. In this particular case though, [TJ] says he was just looking for a project that would give him an excuse to hone his Python skills. Nothing wrong with that around these parts.

Watching the growth of cryptocurrency from our unique vantage point, we can see how the hacker’s interest in Bitcoin as changed over the years. Where we once saw people excited about building custom mining rigs, we now see counters that tick down as the last coins are put into circulation. Looking at projects like this, it seems hackers are happy enough to just give the things away in an interesting way.","It was just another Monday in the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency markets, which stay open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Traders in the 11-year-old digital-asset industry described few changes in business activity or sentiment as coronavirus-related fears gripped Wall Street and sent stock markets reeling.

“We’re not the ones uncomfortable with the volatility today,” said Ricky Li, co-founder and head of Americas at Altonomy, a cryptocurrency-focused proprietary trading firm.

Prices for bitcoin (BTC) slid by 2.9 percent to about $7,800 as of 16:48 UTC (12:48 p.m. Eastern Time) Monday. That decline was less than half the 7 percent plunge in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, a drop so fierce it tripped market “circuit breakers,” temporarily halting trading under exchange rules designed to help limit investor losses.

The latest sell-off in stocks left the S&P 500 down about 18 percent since its record high on Feb. 19. Since then, bitcoin has fallen by about the same percentage. Yet, on a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is still up about 8.6 percent, in contrast with a 7.7 percent loss so far in 2020 for the S&P 500.

Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (the “VIX”), a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500, is trading at its highest levels since the financial crisis. Sometimes called the “Fear Index” by traders, the VIX measures the S&P index’s expected volatility in the coming weeks and usually rises when the market expects stocks to fall.

“Few assets are safe when a ‘black swan’ event such as the coronavirus takes hold of the markets on a global scale,” Connor Abendschein, a research analyst for Digital Assets Data, said in an e-mail. “Bitcoin may find its footing and shine further down the road during this financial crisis.”

One clear takeaway Monday was that as traditional markets undergo a level of anxiety not seen since the 2008 recession, the cryptocurrency industry showed few existential signs of distress.

In fact, bitcoin’s “hash rate” — a gauge of the amount of computing power working to confirm data blocks on the underlying blockchain network — was holding steady at around 122 exhashes, or quintillion hashes, per second, according to Blockchain.com. That’s roughly double where it stood in mid-2019.

Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based digital-asset firm Bequant, said he was seeing interest in new loans from borrowers who have become more bullish on bitcoin following the recent price drop.

He spent a good portion of Sunday morning trading WhatsApp messages with one client who wanted a loan denominated in stablecoins, digital tokens whose value is linked to a government-issued currency like the U.S. dollar. The borrower wanted to use the loan to buy new computers for data processing on the network, known as bitcoin mining because the rewards are paid out in units of the cryptocurrency.

“We’re not seeing any change in sentiment,” Vinokourov said. “There’s no mining capitulation.”

TradeBlock, a digital-asset analysis firm based in New York, wrote Monday in a blog post that the average daily price swings in the S&P 500 recently surpassed those for bitcoin. According to the firm, that hasn’t happened since October 2018.

Steep gains and losses are nothing new to cryptocurrency traders; indeed, bitcoin naysayers from traditional finance have consistently mocked the notion that bitcoin could ever serve as a “safe haven,” or reliable store of value similar to gold or U.S. Treasury bonds.

Bitcoin’s price jumped 13-fold over the course of 2017, only to tumble by 73 percent in 2018. Last year, it rose 94 percent, roughly triple the gains charted by the S&P 500.

Vladimir Cohen, an over-the-counter broker, said he knew of clients who had taken advantage of a price rally in bitcoin earlier this year “to get rid of such a volatile and unpredictable asset.”

Konstantin Plavnik, chief operating officer of the Moscow-based crypto derivatives exchange Xena, said bitcoin’s recent sell-off in synch with stocks might be a bullish sign — bitcoin is “becoming a more effective, full-fledged part of the global financial markets.”

“Bitcoin is a speculative asset, and during the crisis, investors switch to cash,” Plavnik said.

Prices for gold, seen by many big investors as a traditional store of value in times of economic and market distress, are up about 10 percent this year — roughly on par with bitcoin’s 2020 gains.

U.S. government bonds, another asset category long considered a reliable safe haven, have also rallied, with yields on the 10-year note declining by 0.2 percentage point to a record low of 0.51 percent. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.

Yin Shao, co-founder of the trading firm Reciprocity in New York, said he didn’t see anything too notable in bitcoin’s price movement Monday — or any unusual business activity.

“The folks that we generally trade with are not terribly connected to or in tune with what’s going on in traditional markets,” Shao said.

U.S. stocks tumbled even amid signs government authorities are moving quickly to provide economic support and fresh liquidity injections for ailing markets.

The U.S. central bank’s New York branch on Monday offered to pump more cash into distressed markets, increasing one overnight lending program for Wall Street dealers by 50 percent to $150 billion. Futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have upped bets the Federal Reserve will soon make a steep cut in interest rates for the second time this month to support the economy.

Bloomberg News reported that Trump administration officials are drafting measures to blunt the economic impact, beyond the $7.8 billion emergency spending bill passed last week.

Bitcoin, launched in the wake of the 2008 crisis by coders as a new type of money theoretically free from government control, has no such safety net, which serves as a dampener on market volatility.

Zac Prince, CEO of BlockFi, a cryptocurrency lender and vendor, said it’s typical for big crypto traders to borrow more bitcoin during times of heightened volatility — to place transactions designed to capture profits from price dislocations.

“When things move, there’s more stuff for them to do,” Prince said. “I wouldn’t say we’re seeing anything particularly different from the way things usually work.”","Newly-Launched Bitcoin.com Lottery Unlocks Global Lotteries Through Cryptocurrency Payments

Following the recent partnership between Bitcoin.com and Bravio Technologies Limited, the Bitcoin.com Lottery platform has officially launched. It lets users play the most popular global lotteries from any location. Tickets can be purchased using either bitcoin cash (BCH) or bitcoin core (BTC) as payment methods.

Use BCH or BTC to Play Power Ball, Mega Millions and Other Global Jackpots With Bitcoin.com Lottery

Traditional lottery platforms limited users in many ways. Tickets could only be bought within the country users were located and, in addition, users were further restricted by having to pay for those tickets with the country’s local currency. To enter and claim winnings on the U.S. Power Ball, for instance, a user had to be located in the United States and could only buy a ticket with U.S. dollars.

The launch of Bitcoin.com Lottery changes that. For the first time ever, users can enter global lotteries from any country. The platform acts as a booking engine, locally purchasing tickets through official lottery agents on users’ behalf. Furthermore, the Bitcoin.com Lottery platform is also the first to let users buy lottery tickets with cryptocurrency.

“Over recent years we’ve seen a shift in the way lottery tickets are sold, with increasing numbers of people buying them online. However, the limitations of location have remained. You still have to be based in a country to play a lottery there,” explains Bitcoin.com CEO Stefan Rust. “We’ve solved that problem by building a seamless global lottery platform. No matter where you’re based, you can log in and play the world’s leading lotteries.”

Powered by blockchain technology, the platform supports BCH and BTC payments for over ten global lotteries. All users need to purchase tickets through the platform is a suitable wallet app, such as the Bitcoin.com Wallet, and an account on the Bitcoin.com Lottery. After selecting a lottery and numbers, the user proceeds to pay using their wallet app.

Once the payment is made, a select team of local distributors working with the platform will then purchase the tickets, and a scanned copy will appear in the user’s account shortly after. The Bitcoin.com Lottery platform will also notify users should they have any form of winnings to collect, with an in-house customer support team available to help at any time.

Growing Adoption for Bitcoin Cash in Internet Gaming Industry

Bitcoin.com Lottery arose from the partnership between cryptocurrency service provider Bitcoin.com and Canadian internet gaming corporation Bravio Technologies Limited in 2019. The platform was developed by Bravio, a B2B Management Services company that specializes in the design and development of igaming technology.

Paul Carroll, CEO of Bravio Technologies, commented on the landmark launch: “We’ve unveiled a world first. It’s only a matter of time now before we see more igaming companies adopt Bitcoin Cash as a form of mainstream payments and, as a pioneer in this new digital age, the Bitcoin.com Lottery platform is just the beginning.”

Together with Bitcoin.com’s expertise in building on blockchain technology, the partnership has resulted in the creation of a seamless, user-friendly global lottery platform that removes limitations. In the future, the platform will be further developed with plans to let users anonymously cash out winnings directly into their wallets.

Bitcoin.com Lottery currently supports over ten world-famous lotteries. These include the U.S. Power Ball and Mega Millions, the Euro Millions, and the hugely popular €2.24 billion jackpot Loteria de Navidad. Users can get started on the platform by creating a free account.

2020-03-10,"An omnibus bill aimed at comprehensive reform of U.S. cryptocurrency regulation was introduced Monday by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.). It is thought to have little chance of passage at present but, according to lawyers and backers in the industry, it does provide insight into what a top-to-bottom new law governing crypto could look like one day.

Marshall Hayner of Metal Pay and Erik Finman, who became a millionaire from bitcoin (BTC) before the age of 18 and now runs an investment fund, contributed to the discussion draft.

Presented on March 9, the “Crypto-currency Act of 2020” sets out to define categories of digital assets and clarify which federal agency will oversee each tranche.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

“The bill looks to provide not only clarity but legitimacy to crypto assets in the United States,” said Will Stechschulte, Gosar’s legislative assistant, in a press phone call.

Regulatory uncertainty hangs like a cloud over the industry as it aims to attract conventional investors. Fully 56 percent of financial advisers cite “regulatory concerns” as reason not to invest in the nascent industry, a recent Bitwise survey found.

“Regulatory uncertainty has certainly been a shackle around the ankle of U.S. investors,” Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics and a former eToro analyst, said. “Many projects are simply choosing to move elsewhere.”

While there are existing proposals aimed at providing clear guidance – such as the Token Taxonomy Act and Securities and Exchange Commission member Hester Peirce’s “Safe Harbor” proposal – Gosar’s bill is the latest to take a holistic approach to crypto regulation.

‘It’s difficult for a member to move a bill in a committee of which he’s not a member, doubly so if he’s in the minority,’ Brito wrote in a blog post.

The bill divides digital assets into three categories: crypto-commodity, crypto-currency and crypto-security with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Secretary of the Treasury via the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) overseeing each, respectively.

“While the bill makes sense on the surface,” a deeper look reveals that its neat categorizations are potentially fatal flaws, said Lawson Baker, head of operations and general counsel at TokenSoft. A Bloomberg legal analyst said much the same, claiming an early draft of the bill “displays a lack of basic understanding of the relevant federal laws and regulatory agencies.”

Debate over the bill’s efficacy and overreach started in mid-December, when a draft version leaked. Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, directed criticism at the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Gosar, who does not sit on the committees that might discuss his bill.

“It’s difficult for a member to move a bill in a committee of which he’s not a member, doubly so if he’s in the minority,” Brito wrote in a blog post. He now says the bill should be opposed on principle, if it shows any signs of life.

“It’s dead on arrival,” Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, said after reviewing the latest version.

Following its introduction on the floor late Monday afternoon, Ben Goldey, Gosar’s representative, said the bill will now pass to a committee for review. “Usually within the first week it will get assigned, but I suspect Financial Services [Committee,]” will take it up, Goldey said. Finman suggested it may be reviewed first by the House Committee on Agriculture.

It’s dead on arrival.

Whether the bill passes or not, its sweeping ambition is already redefining the scope of crypto regulation. Attempting to simplify the issues around cryptocurrency and its relationship to the larger economy, the bill is an example of why it’s so hard to define what crypto is and how it should be treated.

CoinDesk spoke with lawyers, investors and the bill’s writers about how the bill takes on crypto’s big regulatory issues and likely goes too far.

Regulators’ remit

Gosar’s bill defines crypto-commodities as an “economic good or service, including derivatives that have full or substantial fungibility; the markets treat with no regard as to who produced [them;] and rest on a blockchain or decentralized cryptographical ledger.”

This broadly defined concept would include bitcoin, ethereum, and any digital asset with free-floating valuations. The bill would also place these commodities under the purview of the CFTC. However, as Robert Kim, a Bloomberg legal analyst noted: the CFTC does not regulate commodities themselves, but derivatives traded off them.

“The CFTC indicated early on that virtual currencies, such as bitcoin are commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act. However, that does not mean they regulate the day-to-day activity of spot exchanges,” said Donna Redel, board member of New York Angels and a professor at Fordham Law and Fordham Gabelli School, said. “Do they have the capacity to review that? The regulators themselves would have to see what’s feasible here.”

See also: Lawmakers Reintroduce Bill to Exempt Crypto Tokens From US Securities Laws

Similarly, FinCEN was selected to oversee “crypto-currencies,” despite not actually regulating currency. Marshall Hayner of Metal Pay thinks that’s a pedantic statement.

“When you launch a crypto product and deal with stablecoins, you’re dealing with FinCEN,” he said in a phone call. “Anti-money laundering requirements are top of mind for any firm that wants to remain compliant.”

Easy definitions

Lawson Baker, head of operations and general counsel at TokenSoft, a technology company automating finance by porting financial assets onto blockchains, noted that the definition given to “crypto-securities” by the bill does not capture real-world use cases of blockchain technology.

The proposed definition: “all debt and equity that rest on a blockchain or decentralized cryptographic ledger,” makes sense in some contexts, Baker said, but in reference to traditional assets misses the mark.

For example, there’s mortgage debt that could be issued on a blockchain. “Under [the bill’s] rules, a tokenized mortgage would be a ‘crypto-security’ requiring registration with the SEC absent an offering exemption,” Baker said. “As we all know, mortgages are already regulated by state and federal banking laws and not the SEC.”

My gut says we should stay nimble right now and define later. Read: push regulators to provide rule updates or additional guidance.

Likewise, Redel pointed out that even broad definitions may not allow projects room to breathe. She pointed instead to Hester Peirce’s proposal for a safe harbor for token projects, which grants three years exemption for projects to decentralize.

“The digital asset industry is constantly evolving,” Redel said. “Any effort of legislation has to take into account future innovation in the space and what else happens in the coming years. It’s not good to bet on a horse race if you don’t know the players.”

Blockchains evolve

Under the Act, a “decentralized cryptographic ledger” refers to a “ledger that (A) runs as a stand-alone blockchain that is secured through a minting mechanism.” As Baker notes, “This definition presumes all cryptocurrencies will operate on blockchains and public ledgers, completely ignoring how privacy coins like Zcash will operate in the future.”

Wider economy

Mati Greenspan takes a realistic view. While clearer frameworks may bring in entrepreneurs, investors and traditional financiers standing on the sideline of crypto, decisions to invest are also impacted by the larger mechanizations of the economy.

“Sentiment is way down due to the effects of the [Corona] virus and most people aren’t exactly in an investing mood lately,” Greenspan said.

Likewise, Nic Carter, a venture capitalist with Castle Island Ventures, said crypto is “an asset class that’s really just an outlet for gambling.” Adding, these “excesses of crypto [are] definitely a function of our stage in the economic cycle.”

Carter adds that clear guidance for tax liabilities are also necessary, which the bill fails to address.

‘Stay nimble’

What good is an omnibus bill if it cannot pass? What about more focused approaches for that matter?

The Token Taxonomy Act was successfully introduced, but was ultimately stalled during the review period. While Erik Finman is confident that his bill will pass, “I’m not even considering failure as an option,” he said, a similar situation is likely to transpire here.

“The optimum way to regulate the industry would be for the agencies to come up with a robust set of rules,” Donna Redel said. “This is preferable than the slower process of adjudicating and then waiting for the agencies to catch up. But the courts will, hopefully, always be there to provide guidance.”

While this process is slow, and companies may lose time and competition, Redel is skeptical that any prescriptive law could cover all the facets of the industry.

Josh Lawler, a partner at Zuber Lawler, agreed. “Looking at various statutory schemes, most don’t work. The Swiss system doesn’t work, really. Some are better than others, but it’s not that easy to get a comprehensive plan.”","Ethereum (ETH) price has continued to fall after a dreadful weekend, which saw the price drop to around $198 , wiping out last week's gains. The cryptocurrency is currently trading slightly above the $200 support level and faces a nervy week in which it could drop as low as $170.

Ethereum Drops to $200 as Crypto Markets Crash

The coin has had a stellar year to date, having started the year at $130. It reached $280 in mid-February, outperforming even Bitcoin (BTC) in its percentage climb. However, there has been a market-wide sell-off as of late, with Bitcoin falling below the $8,000 level in the last week of February. ETH shed $50 and dropped to $220 and is continuing to suffer.

Following the massive market-wide sell-off, the combined market capitalization of cryptos has dropped from $264 billion to around $226 billion . This is because of growing market concerns that coins will lose most of the gains they have accumulated since the beginning of the year. Since cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, it is important to note that a 20% move in either direction is something to expect from a near-term perspective.

Cryptocurrencies Impacted by Crashing of Global Markets

In the event that ETH rebounds from its current level, it could likely test the $219 resistance level in the short-term, although this will need a surge in volume as a catalyst. The most important thing to note is that the decline in crypto prices cannot be compared to what global markets are experiencing. However, for Ethereum, the concern is whether bulls are in control of the markets or whether the crashing of global markets will continue to impact the coin.

This year, Ethereum has made some progress, and the launch of ETH2.0 has been boosted by the rollout of technical improvements. ETH2.0 will be a significant upgrade for the network, as it will add new features and shift to a Proof of Stake consensus.

Email","Blockchain.com Will Allow Retail Wallet Users to Borrow USD Stablecoins With Cryptocurrency

The digital assets lending field seems to be heating up with Blockchain.com starting to offer lending directly to retail consumers globally. Borrowed USD stablecoins can be used by crypto traders to fund their next trades and thus increase the leverage of their holdings.

Popular Wallet to Offer Crypto Lending for Global Retail Users

Blockchain.com, the provider of cryptocurrency services with over 46 million wallets created to date, has launched Borrow, a product offering retail users to borrow USD-pegged stablecoins against crypto assets held in their wallets. The new lending service is now available to users in more than 180 countries.

This launch follows the launch by Blockchain.com of an institutional lending desk in August 2019, which was handling $120 million a month by November. And the company said it will be offering retail users access to the same liquidity pool as institutional investors.

The company explained that as soon as the collateral is posted, users receive their loan and are free to use the stablecoins however they see fit. This means that retail traders can also use it to fund new trades without cashing out their previous investments and thus increase their leverage.

“Institutional and retail investors have the same financial goals – grow wealth and manage risks – but the tools at their disposal are vastly different,” commented Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain.com. “Now, with our suite of trading products and Borrow, retail users can trade like the big guys without selling the crypto they’ve stockpiled or leaving their wallet.”

Digital Asset Lending Field Is Getting Crowded

On Thursday, March 5, custody service provider Bitgo announced that it is now offering institutional digital asset lending services after a few months of private beta. The lending service was said to be built by a Wall Street team that understands institutional investors’ needs.

“Our goal was to build a lending business that is similar to lending businesses in the traditional financial markets,” said Nick Carmi, Head of Financial Services, Bitgo. “We are not interested in a high-volume, low-margin business; we are building deep relationships with our clients to drive value for them and to create a long term, sustainable business.”

Babel Finance, a Chinese crypto lending company, also released its 2019 annual report on March 5. In its outlook on 2020 the report noted that “The lending market is increasingly crowded because of the horizontal development strategy adopted by various crypto finance players.” Still, the company’s outstanding loan balance broke a new record high this year, reaching $380 million on February 18, 2020.

In a somewhat vague blog post Monday, the San Francisco-based exchange recommitted to the potentially massive market, which has seen its crypto industry suppressed by the central bank’s order in April 2018 that prevented banks providing services to firms such as exchanges.

As such, India represents a huge earning opportunity for companies that can now speedily establish themselves in the near vacuum left by the ban. Several exchanges were forced to close due to the banking restrictions and others eked out a living on crypto-to-crypto trading or other means.

In its post, Kraken said it was “thrilled” to see the Reserve Bank of India’s ban overturned, and would “recommit resources to grow its service in the region through new features and offerings.” Among those was a hint it may target the massive remittance market in India, with Kraken keen to help Indians save and “send value” to friends and family overseas.

For more precise information on its plans, we’ll have to wait till later in the year, Kraken wrote.

While the court ruling was exciting news for the crypto space, the regulatory situation in the nation is still not rosy, however. The central bank has reportedly said it would return to fight the supreme court ruling, though that may be a long shot. More worryingly, the country’s government has been mulling cryptocurrency regulation for years, with some reports suggesting an outright ban.

Even if untrue, India’s crypto and blockchain industry can’t fully thrive and find the investment it needs until the situation has been made clear.

Local exchanges said this month there is a strong appetite for cryptocurrencies and derivatives in the nation. Before the court ruling, some international crypto companies including Binance and OKEx had already made moves to satisfy that hunger, announcing local services via acquisitions or partnerships.","In a push to engage more users, Non-custodial crypto exchange, and wallet platform, Edge is teaming up with Cred to offer cryptocurrency lending and borrowing services across its ecosystem.

As part of this agreement, Edge users will be able to lend their digital assets and earn interest of up to ten percent via Cred Earn application, just like a regular savings account.

Edge clients now can commit to a fixed-term and receive monthly interest payments, with the option to roll over pledged assets for additional periods after their initial term expires. The company explained that customers would receive the best Cred rates when staking different coins and tokens, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. No account minimum is needed, and interest is paid out in fiat or cryptocurrency.

Cred, a licensed crypto lender, based in California, has already struck up with other crypto exchanges, including Bittrex and Binance. The latter entails migrating a number of Cred’s ERC20 LBA tokens to Binance Chain.

According to its website, Cred offers two services: “Borrow” and “Earn,” which allow users to borrow fiat currencies with crypto coins as collateral, as well as offering interest rates on deposits of more than 30 crypto and fiat currencies through its partner network. The firm, which is backed by Binance Labs and Arrington XRP Capital, also operates a decentralized banking platform serving customers in 190 countries and claims to have already secured over $300 million in lending capital

Paul Puey, CEO, and Co-founder of Edge.ommented: “Cred stood out to us for many reasons — the caliber of its team, the strength of its legal and regulatory infrastructure, its capital markets competencies, a proven track record of delivering returns, and its scale. Edge users now have the benefit of earning interest on their crypto via a secure and licensed financial services platform.”

“While there are many wallets and exchanges on the market, it is rare to see a self custody solution as advanced as Edge. We look forward to supporting Edge’s continued growth and enabling Edge customers to lend and borrow in a secure manner,” added Dan Schatt, CEO and Co-Founder of Cred.","The term “black swan” event refers to a random, extremely negative occurrence for which there is no way to predict that it might happen and no precedent to predict what it might result in.

The term was popularized by former Wall Street trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2001 book, Fooled by Randomness. It has been used to describe the 2008 crash of the housing bubble in the United States (and the recession that followed it), the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, the dissolution of the Soviet Union–the list goes on.

Now, the term has found a new application. A number of analysts and news sites have referred to the spread of the coronavirus and the economic cliff dive that has followed as the latest black swan to have landed in the modern world: an event that could not have been predicted, and for which there is no modern precedent.

The effect of the coronavirus has been felt on markets far and wide–and, because its effects have been so unpredictable, its effects on a number of financial markets are teaching the world that in many ways, it didn’t know what it didn’t know.

This includes the ongoing narrative in much of the cryptocurrency community, which has long slated Bitcoin as a “safe haven” asset–something that, like gold, could be turned to in times of crisis in order to protect the value of its users’ wealth.

However, the price movements that have ensued amid the ongoing spread of the coronavirus seem to tell a different story–not only for Bitcoin but for financial markets across the board.

In these uncertain times, what really constitutes a safe haven? And what will happen should the virus continue to spread?

The nature of the beast

It seems that almost nothing is safe from the reach of the coronavirus–every corner of the market has been affected in some way.

This is because the nature of the financial crisis that has resulted from the spread of the coronavirus is somewhat unique. Kehan Zhou, chief executive of investment strategy firm Wall Strategies, explained to Finance Magnates that “initially, [the spread of Coronavirus] was thought of as purely a health crisis, but the market eventually realized that the lack of production in China means that US companies are running out of inventories.”

Indeed, prior to the havoc that the outbreak has wreaked on global financial spheres, “we were in a raging bull market.,” Mr. Zhou said. This may have fueled the sell-offs that have occurred over the last several weeks: “many investors have profits that they want to protect, which led to a quick sell-off at the first sign of a recession.”

Efforts to lessen the blow of the outbreak have some had much of an effect Zhou explained: “the rate cut from the Fed was not impactful. This is because the coronavirus is a shock to the supply side of our economy not a problem with demand. People have money, and in fact, they are piling up their carts now as we speak.”

“In short, the market has been really complacent due to the bull market we were in–but now people are finally beginning to understand the implications of Corona on companies around the world.”

The week began with carnage in oil prices and stock markets

The biggest shock of the week so far came no Monday morning with the news that oil prices had crashed: Brent Crude fell over 31 percent shortly after the open on Monday morning, while West Texas Intermediate dropped 34 percent–the largest crash that had been seen since January 17th, 1991–the start of the first Gulf War.

The collapse, which was triggered by a conflict in the OPEC+ alliance following Russia’s refusal to make cuts to its production as a result of the coronavirus. Bloomberg reported that “not only will those reductions now not happen, but the current curbs will expire at the end of this quarter.”

Saudi Arabia is also “aggressively opening the taps to flood the market with cheap crude”–meaning that prices could fall even further throughout the month, and possibly beyond. As a result, prices fell to $27.34 a barrel–the lowest levels that the industry has seen since 2016.

At the same time, stock markets are continuously falling across the board. The New York Times reported that the S&P500 crashed nearly 8 percent, alleging that “the mayhem is threatening to roil the underlying global financial system and the abilities of companies large and small to survive a potential economic monsoon.”

Effects on Bitcoin prices have been severe, but not as severe as in other markets

So–how has this affected Bitcoin?

“Bitcoin, while it hasn’t sold off to the same degree as some single stock equities, hasn’t demonstrated the same resilience that many commentators were expecting,” said Jon Deane, chief executive of physical commodity digitization firm Infinigold, in an email to Finance Magnates.

Indeed, while crypto markets shed a whopping $38 billion over the weekend–starting at $263 billion at 05.00 GMT on Saturday, March 7th, to $225 billion at the same time on Monday, March 9th (a decline of roughly 14.4%)–Bitcoin wasn’t quite as deeply affected as the total market cap.

(And, notably, not as deeply affected as the price of oil.)

Bitcoin’s market cap fell from $166 billion to $143 billion (roughly 13.8%) over the same 48-hour time period. As a result, the price of Bitcoin has plummeted from roughly $9,100 on Saturday, March 7th (05.00 GMT) to $7,840–a price level that BTC hasn’t seen since January. At press time, the price had stabilized around $7,900.

However, according to Mr. Deane, the decline in the price of Bitcoin over the weekend has revealed something important about who may have been propping the price of Bitcoin up in the first place: “Bitcoin, in my opinion, has been consumed by short term traders,” he explained.

“Technical trading dominates the price action, and until we see more investors in the space, it is difficult to envisage Bitcoin moving materially higher. Long term, this could be a negative for Bitcoin because at its core, its utility is meant to be a store of value.”

This dominance of technical traders in the space could already be on the way to change: “there are obviously a number of institutions currently building the infrastructure to originate Bitcoin interest from institutional investors, as well as the rails to facilitate transactions,” Mr. Deane said.

“Once we start to see the makeup of the market participants change, then I would anticipate the utility value of Bitcoin starting to override some of the short term trading impacts.”

”There is nothing wrong with the economy itself. Thus, like other risky assets, Bitcoins also sold off.”

Kehan Zhou also said that Bitcoin’s fall alongside other financial markets has more to do with the nature of the current sell-off at large, rather than Bitcoin’s possible usage as a true “safe haven” in times of financial crisis.

Indeed, “Bitcoin, as an alternative currency, tends to rise in value when people lose faith in the traditional financial market,” Mr. Zhou explained. “In fact, it was born as a result of the 2008 financial crisis.”

However, Mr. Zhou believes that Bitcoin also “tanked” this time because “this crisis is a result of supply chain shock. There is nothing wrong with the economy itself. Thus, like other risky assets, Bitcoins also sold off.”

In other words, the recent economic downturn–as severe as it has been–may have mostly been a reaction to what could happen rather that what has actually happened.

Indeed, Will Reeves, chief executive of Fold, told Finance Magnates that “as serious as the coronavirus is, at this point the US stock markets are reacting to the threat of the coronavirus disrupting the economy rather than reacting to an existing reality.”

But of course, there is some disruption to the global flow of goods and services: “fundraising from Chinese investors has experienced a slowdown, as their operations are tied up in the quarantine efforts,” Mr. Reeves said.

And regardless of the cause of the downturn, the outcome could be the same: “whether caused by the coronavirus or exploding national debt, or something else, another recession is incredibly likely.”

Bitcoin could become a “safe haven” if the coronavirus were to significantly impact the USD

And this–this kind of true recession that would have serious consequences for the currencies of major economies–could eventually result in the widespread usage of Bitcoin as a safe haven.

After all, historically speaking, Bitcoin tends to be used as a safe haven by individuals who live in countries with failing currencies–the most famous examples of this are in Zimbabwe and Venezuela, where hyperinflation in the countries has, at times, caused Bitcoin to trade at a premium due to its popularity.

However, the world’s most important fiat currencies seem to be doing fine, and some analysts even say they’re poised for growth. Indeed, Ali Khedery, Exxon’s former senior Middle East advisor and current CEO of US-based strategy firm Dragoman Ventures, told CoinDesk that “I don’t think any asset is safe right now – except cash, U.S. dollars.”

Jon Deane also told Finance Magnates that “market participants have switched quickly out of growth-related assets”, Mr. Deane explained, while “gold and US treasuries” have attracted investors who have grown weary of the doom and gloom in other financial markets.

Indeed, gold has rallied significantly over the course of the month, spiking significantly with the news of the crash in oil prices and stock markets.

This is because the “safe havens” that investors are seeking are “something that is stable and to some degree immune from asset price volatility during periods of stress.”

In other words, Bitcoin may not become a true global safe haven until the USD and other major world currencies truly start to falter–which isn’t an impossibility.

Indeed, despite the towering global status of the almighty dollar, even it wasn’t totally unaffected by the financial cliff dives that started the week. As if shaken, the USD fell for a short time against the euro on Monday before showing signs of recovery; the USD has also fallen from a peak of nearly 0.93 against the euro earlier this month to roughly 0.88 at press time.

Will the drop continue? Only time will tell.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

BlockFi has announced today it is supporting cash transfers on its platform.

BlockFi Ushers in Fiat On-Ramp

Weeks after the company’s $30 million Series B funding round led by Valar Ventures, BlockFi has announced the introduction of wire transfers of fiat directly to the platform.

The move marks the New Jersey-based CeFi giant’s first fiat on-ramp channel. The wire transfer service will be available to clients around the world.

Wire transfers will be powered by Silvergate, a publicly-traded financial institution that operates the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a 24/7 payment network. Many of the largest cryptocurrency market participants use the network including, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and bitFlyer.

Crypto-Curious Welcome

The platform offers support for trading between USDC, LTC, BTC, ETH, and GUSD.

It also offers crypto collateralized cash loans and compound interest of up to 8.6% in its interest-earning accounts. Its current rates for Bitcoin are 4.9% for up to 3 BTC, falling to 3.2% on amounts above 3 BTC.

On the announcement of launching its new fiat on-ramp, CEO and founder Zac Prince told Crypto Briefing:

“This announcement is significant for us at BlockFi in that it’s the first step towards our vision of opening up crypto for the mainstream and making one’s first bitcoin buy a simple and familiar, rather than intimidating, process. The crypto market is ready to mature to wider adoption, but in order to do so, it needs these kinds of diverse tools to 1) highlight the value of investing in digital assets and 2) provide easy channels for everyday people to onboard into the digital asset ecosystem. Earning 8.6% interest on any retail investment today is rare, so to make that available for people all over the world can be incredibly powerful to inspire someone’s first crypto purchase.”

The firm has also secured a money services business license for the state of Florida.","Cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb is clamping down on suspicious transactions less than a week after South Korea, its home country, moved to enact tough new laws for the virtual asset space.

Bithumb announced Tuesday it had deployed Chainalysis’ “Reactor” investigations tool to get ahead of illicit activity. Reactor, used in many cryptocurrency law enforcement actions, will help the exchange’s compliance officers police their network, according to a press release.

The announcement follows the South Korean National Assembly’s early March vote to amend the Special Financial Transactions Information Act, which, once signed into law, will force all virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to register with the government and submit to an internet security certification program. Bithumb is one of the few South Korean VASPs to have already completed both aspects.

The National Assembly’s vote brings its money transmission laws more in line with the Financial Action Task Force’s recommendations around VASPs last year, ahead of a June deadline for countries to comply.

But the 12-month deal with Chainalysis also addresses the spate of recent hacks against Bithumb, a historically hack–ridden exchange that has lost tens of millions in crypto – and in a country, South Korea, that has become an exchange raider’s billion-dollar honeypot.

“They had an immediate need for Reactor to manage their hack last year, and wanted to focus on boosting their investigative skills,” said Chainalysis’ Head of Communications Maddie Kennedy.

Many private-sector crypto companies partner with Chainalysis, though not always for Reactor. Tether uses “Know Your Transaction” to build risk profiles, as does Bittrex, Binance and some 150 other VASPs around the world, by Chainalysis’ own count.

Kennedy said Bithumb and Chainalysis are now in talks to provide KYT, too.","The cryptocurrency market has taken a tumble in recent weeks and days. Perhaps most notably, the price of Bitcoin recently fell to levels near $7,500 during yesterday’s stock market meltdown. Now, a Libra Association member is shedding some light on the crypto market downturn.

What’s behind the recent crypto market downturn?

Specifically, this crypto broker profile is Marc Bhargava, the co-founder of Tagomi. Tagomi is a “crypto prime broker” from New York, which recently become a member of the Libra Association. Moreover, Bhargava is now offering some “rooftop view” insight from Tagomi on the recent market fall.

According to Bhargava, the crypto market’s recent stumble is due to margin calls on non-crypto assets. This could be leading to liquidations in the cryptocurrency market. This is, in turn, similar to Toshi Times’ take that the stock market fall is spreading into the crypto market.

Bhargava also suggests that although Bitcoin may become a “counter-cyclical” asset, such as gold, it is not there yet. This reasoning could further explain why Bitcoin fell sharply yesterday, but gold saw gains during the stock market fall.

“That’s just not where it [Bitcoin] is yet in terms of its evolution, primarily because larger asset managers and macro traders don’t trade/own BTC yet, and so you don’t see it independent from equity market movements like you do for gold.”

Stock market panic could be gripping the crypto market

What’s more, Bhargava also indicates that the stock market panic is affecting the crypto market. In fact, he suggests that Bitcoin and crypto is more akin to technology stocks than it is to gold:

“BTC and crypto is currently a risk-on asset, more similar to tech and VC than gold, so with oil prices and the general stock market tanking, the latter more due to coronavirus and the global slowdown associated with it, it’s not surprising that there are multiple sellers of crypto right now.”

These comments tie into recent suggestions by Campbell Harvey, a professor of International Business at Duke University. According to Harvey, this recent stock and crypto market plunge show that cryptocurrencies are, in fact, not safe havens.

“People didn’t flee to cryptos”

“Now, if these cryptos were safe havens, then you would expect maybe no change in their value or maybe even an increase in value. But that’s definitely not what we’ve seen. The cryptos got battered and dropped by more than 10%.

Harvey starts by stating that safe havens would be largely immune to major market events. However, yesterday’s Bitcoin drop towards $7,500 indicate that this is, in fact, not the case.

“So that suggests to me, in a particular situation of great stress where people are realizing that there’s systemic risk unfolding, the stock market drops as expected, people flee to safe assets, but they didn’t flee to cryptos, they fled to the U.S. 10-year bond.”

One should note, however, that the cryptocurrency market is now on the rebound. Specifically, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $8,150 and the crypto market is in the green. Nevertheless, today’s trading will likely also be volatile."
2020-03-11,"Using the word “crypto” to describe Bitcoin is an inaccuracy that comes from early misunderstandings and a false connection to distinctly different systems. As we move into an era where Bitcoin will begin to power the digital transaction economy, it’s time to let go and use more appropriate terms to describe this industry. So, “digital currency” it is.

On that note, “mining” also needs to go. Transaction processors play a far more important role than simply “digging up” new coins. “Mining” only applies to the disappearing block subsidy, which is only there to prime the pump—the true function of the nodes is transaction processing and this takes over as the subsidy dies. No more coal mine stock photos, or gold mining puns in articles, let’s give them the respect they deserve.

After 11 years of Bitcoin, we’re grown accustomed to seeing these expressions. But something never felt quite right about them. They seemed forced, bolted-on, a rushed attempt to describe a new industry using words people could relate to somehow. And over those years, “crypto” and “cryptocurrency” have also acquired the stigma of anonymity, crime, and get-rich-quick schemes like ICOs.

“Digital transaction” and “transaction processors”—get used to those expressions, because you’ll be seeing them a lot more often in the future.

‘Bitcoin is not like this’

Bitcoin creator Dr. Craig Wright described the need for more accurate descriptors, saying:

“Cryptocurrency is linked to a lot of discredited systems (right back to eCash) that are linked to black market and illegal use cases (drugs, money laundering etc). Next, Bitcoin is not encrypted. Blind cash systems such as Digicash used cryptographic constructs directly and are associated with encrypted transactions that cannot be traced. Bitcoin is not like this.”

“Bitcoin is sent in clear text. The hash is an index to the identity exchange between peers (people) but nothing is secret. It is private but not hidden.”

There’s another, er, key difference. Dr. Wright continued:

“With encrypted systems, the loss of the key means the inability to access data. Bitcoin is not encrypted. The transaction is published publicly. So, nothing is going to stop recovery if the nodes agree (nodes enforce rules and courts issue rules).”

“Even the NSA cannot force access to an encrypted file when the private key is destroyed, but, again… Bitcoin is clear text and public. So, losing a key doesn’t mean the transaction is lost.”

“I used digital signature algorithms in bitcoin, but this is still not cryptography. It is a system that uses the same maths in a new manner.”

He also noted that “Bitcoin was never a new technology.” In his 1996 piece, “The Wild, Wild Web,” Gregory Spears articulated web IPOs, which used tokens to raise funds. We now call these ICOs, but the difference is that a blockchain stops the Ponzi schemes from deleting logs. Dr. Wright said:

Token security offers and capital raising dates back decades. Bitcoin was never a new technology in this area.

In the Nineties…

“Cryptocurrency” is a word that comes from Dr. Wright’s favorite decade, the 1990s. Early allusions to the term run alongside “untraceable” and “anonymous” money—which has shown itself to be undesirable. Interestingly, some of the first published references come from those concerned with investigating its uses. There’s the NSA’s “How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash” from 1996, also referenced in The American Law Review in 1997.

It’s a difficult word to say, and one that causes outsiders’ eyes to glaze over. If they can relate to it at all, their minds subconsciously connect it to more negative aspects of the past like scams, bubbles, and crime.

Writers also know it’s a difficult word to type. If you don’t believe us, search the web for “crypocurrency” and “crytocurrency” and see how many results you get.

We know you’ll check the whitepaper, so here it is

For the record, Satoshi Nakamoto‘s 2008 Bitcoin whitepaper does not refer to “cryptocurrency” or “miners” the way they’re commonly used in today’s discourse. There are just two sentences that allude to these terms. This one:

What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust

And this one:

The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation.

Bitcoin is “based on” cryptography, but it is not itself a form of cryptography and it doesn’t function the same way. Contrary to popular belief, it is not “secured by” cryptography either. Bitcoin has an economic model secured by incentives and costs—transaction processors do their job for profit, and hacking or taking over the network is prohibitively expensive.

Cryptographers themselves have never liked the word “crypto” for digital transaction networks. That abbreviation describes their field, and many have expressed displeasure at it being reapplied to just one specific application. And miners? Like Satoshi said, it’s only meant to be an analogy—a comparison to allow newcomers to more easily grasp what’s going on.

We’re happy for the real cryptographers to have their word back, and restore it to its proper meaning.

Bitcoin and the digital transaction industry are mature now. The industry is ready to move on to greater challenges, and in doing so must discard the expressions that narrowed its mission so much. It gives us great pleasure to announce that crypto is dead… long live the digital transaction era.

That’s the conclusion of a recent report by the Better Business Bureau (BBB), a nonprofit organization focused on marketplace trust.

The report found an average dollar loss in crypto-focused fraud of $3,000 for victims age 25 to 44. The relatively high figure was the result of nefarious actors taking advantage of those who lacked foundational knowledge of digital assets, BBB said.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Thirty-two percent of scams involved the exchange of cryptocurrencies for goods, services or fiat currency, while 23.4 percent involved the purchase of digital assets as purported investment opportunities, BBB found. Roughly one-third (31 percent) of cryptocurrency scams with a financial loss involved a company known as C2CX, apparently based in China.

It’s worth noting that crypto crimes measured in the scam statistics include loss of funds resulting from hackers who infiltrated exchanges considered “vulnerable.” BBB didn’t provide data on how much of the risk rating arose from such hacks as opposed to fraudulent schemes.

The report looked at 10 different types of scam, with crypto ranking just above “online purchase” types of fraud, which came in third.

Cryptocurrency, however, fell behind employment scams to rank as the second most risky type with an index rating of 93.8, an internal measurement that takes into account a number of varying factors including susceptibility and exposure.

Riskiest Scams of 2019 Source: Better Business Bureau

Exposure to crypto scams rose by just 0.4 percent year on year, one of the least, while employment scams rose by a much larger margin of around 9.3 percent. The latter type of fraud involves bad actors attempting to trick victims into sending money for a supposed “guaranteed” way to make quick bucks or gain a high-salaried job.","Tax Office to Contact 350,000 Australians and Remind Them to Report All Crypto Profits

Australian tax agents have set out to close a gap they say costs the state several billion dollars. Taxpayers who file various work-related claims and investment property deductions or declare income from sharing economy platforms such as Uber and Airbnb may be asked for explanations and receipts. Investors and traders earning income from cryptocurrencies are also among the targeted.

Crypto Investors Advised to Keep Detailed Records of All Transactions

The revenue service has started contacting hundreds of thousands of Australians via mail and email to remind them of the tax obligations that come with cryptocurrency trading. A spokesman for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) told News.com.au that people who sold cryptocurrency during the 2017/18 financial year may be asked to review their tax returns. Those who fail to correct any established discrepancies can be audited and risk penalties. The official stated:

Over the next two months we expect to contact as many as 350,000 individuals who have traded in cryptocurrency in the last few years.

Taxpayers who only held crypto but didn’t trade will be updated about the information they are required to gather. Investors should keep detailed records including receipts of purchase or transfer of cryptocurrency, exchange and digital wallet records, the date and the value of each transaction in Australian dollars at the time it took place. They should also be able to explain the purpose of each transaction and identify other involved parties.

Financial gains from trading and exchanging crypto as well as from converting it into local or foreign fiat is subject to capital gains tax in Australia, where cryptocurrency is considered a property-like asset for tax purposes. The country has advanced in its efforts to regulate the crypto space further than other nations. It has over 300 registered digital asset exchanges, as news.Bitcoin.com reported last month. A recent court ruling added another layer of legitimacy describing cryptocurrencies as “a recognized form of investment.”

ATO Gets Its Information From Cryptocurrency Exchanges

The Australian Taxation Office has a dedicated page on its website that details the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies in the country. Last year, the administration published its Cryptocurrency Data Matching Protocol covering the financial years between 2014/15 and 2019/20. The program was introduced to obtain transaction data from exchanges on taxpayers who have bought and sold cryptocurrency, the ATO representative pointed out and further commented:

Our campaign is designed to help raise awareness and give people the opportunity to fix any mistakes.

The tax service has estimated that up to a million people in Australia have bought and sold cryptocurrency. Many of them might not have realized the tax implications and simply failed to report the profits on their tax returns. Others may have thought that the ATO does not have the means to track these transactions which are conducted online and often involve foreign currency. As the agency now gets its information directly from cryptocurrency exchanges, however, this assumption does not hold up.

As reported by Jiji Press Wednesday, the men were held by the Metropolitan Police Department for allegedly obtaining NEM that were the suspected proceeds of crime – illegal under the law relating to punishment of organized crime. One of the two arrested – who are claimed to have known the tokens were stolen – is a doctor from Hokkaido and the other is a company exec from Osaka.

Coincheck suffered possibly the biggest-ever breach of a cryptocurrency exchange in January 2018, losing around $530 million worth of NEM. The hack was likely bigger even than that of Mt. Gox, which is thought to have lost $340 million in bitcoin over a period of time.

India has become increasingly attractive to new crypto businesses and investors from all over the world now that the supreme court has lifted the banking ban. Some companies are expanding operations into the Indian market while others are investing in the country’s crypto ecosystem.

Businesses Expanding Into India

After the supreme court quashed the banking ban imposed by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a number of companies worldwide have expressed their interest in the Indian crypto sector.

Global bitcoin exchange Kraken announced on Monday its recommitment to the Indian market. The San Francisco-based company, with offices in several countries, explained that its growth in India had been limited by the RBI’s 2018 circular which prohibited banks from opening accounts for crypto exchanges. Kraken has “long served the Indian market with a full suite of exchange products, including spot, derivatives and futures, all complete with best-in-class security and execution,” the team noted, elaborating:

Armed with the ability to expand our offering, Kraken is excited to recommit resources to grow its service in the region through new features and offerings.

Kraken is not the only international crypto company committed to growing its operations in India. Even before the banking ban was lifted, Binance had been focusing on growing its services in the country. The company acquired local crypto exchange Wazirx in November last year. U.K.-based crypto banking platform Cashaa began supporting INR for Indian users in October last year and has since been ramping up its offerings for Indian users. Its CEO recently launched a roadshow to prepare Indian crypto enthusiasts for the next bull run. Other companies that have expressed interest in the Indian market include Kucoin and Paxful.

Investments Flowing Into Indian Crypto Economy

Not only are businesses expanding operations in India, but some companies are also planning to inject capital into the Indian crypto ecosystem. Global software company Hashcash Consultants, for example, announced on Monday:

Hashcash Consultants is planning to invest $10 million in the recently revived Indian crypto industry in 2020.

The company operates U.S.-based crypto exchange Paybito and crypto payment processor Billbitcoins. According to its website, Hashcash has a presence in 26 countries and more than 100 enterprises use its products, such as for retail remittances, corporate payments, trade finance and payment processing.

The company now focuses on expanding its network in Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and India, Monday’s announcement reveals.

Interest in Cryptocurrencies Growing in India

On Monday, the Economic Times reported that India has become one of the 10 most popular locations to start a business according to an analysis conducted by marketing and analytics firm Semrush. The firm studied 606 fintech companies in India and analyzed related Google search data over the past four years.

According to Semrush, the leading domains by web traffic were Billdesk, Paytm, and NSE India. Most visitors were between the ages of 25 and 34. Overall, 36% of the searches were made by women. The most searched cryptocurrencies were bitcoin, ignis, ethereum, nano, and XRP, the publication conveyed. The Indian states with the most search interest in investing were Delhi, Haryana, and Karnataka. The states with the largest number of searches for buying bitcoin were Haryana, Delhi, West Bengal, Karnataka, and Kerala.

Supreme Court Verdict Turning the Tide for India

Following the RBI ban, several crypto businesses either moved overseas or ceased their operations altogether. “When a regulator, like RBI, bans, the market closes down,” Blocksurvey CEO Wilson Bright was quoted by the Economic Times as saying. “Six months back, we pivoted from crypto to blockchain, as we had to sustain. No investor was ready to back us amid the uncertainty of regulations.” Incrypt Blockchain founder Nitin Sharma told the publication, “From my perspective, hopefully, the funding environment for startups gets better as funds no longer have to worry as much about regulatory clarity.”

Hashcash Consultants CEO Raj Chowdhury welcomed the supreme court verdict, stating:

This is a historic judgment by supreme court that puts India back in the global crypto map. The reinstating of cryptocurrency activities has opened up an entire geography, for fresh collaborations and ventures for the global players, forecasting prospects for the crypto industry and the Indian economy at large.

“With over 1 billion population, the Indian market is a sleeping giant,” Wazirx CEO Nischal Shetty shared with news.Bitcoin.com. “I’m confident that this judgment will have a positive impact on the global crypto ecosystem. This will lead to more startups in crypto in India. Hundreds of startups will be created. VC investment will activate in the sector. More jobs.”

Tokyo police arrested two individuals on Wednesday for acquiring stolen NEM from the 2018 Coincheck hack. On Jan. 26, 2018, the Japanese trading platform Coincheck noticed an “illicit transfer” of 523,000,000 NEM and it was the largest cryptocurrency exchange hack since Mt Gox. According to Tokyo investigators, the two men who obtained the purloined stash of NEM knew they collected coins derived from a crime.

Two Men Arrested in Japan for Purchasing Coincheck’s Stolen NEM

Tokyo officials have arrested two men for buying stolen NEM (XEM) from the Coincheck hack two years ago. During the last week of January 2018, the Japan-based trading platform was hacked losing more than 523 million NEM (XEM). The exchange compromise ($530 million using 2018 exchange rates) was the largest crypto trading platform failure to date since the Mt Gox breach in 2013. Following the Coincheck hack, the firm notified 260,000 affected users it would repay them at a rate of 88.549 JPY per XEM. Additionally, not too long after the Coincheck attack, armchair crypto sleuths and blockchain analysis teams noticed the stolen XEM on the move.

By the first week of March 2018, it was noted that more than 40% of the stolen Coincheck funds were laundered. By the end of the same month, a Nikkei report detailed that nearly all of the XEM taken were laundered through deep web channels. At the time, the XEM vendors on the invisible web sold the currency at a mere fraction of what XEM was selling for on spot markets. Tokyo-based security firm L Plus confirmed that the sellers on the deep web sold all of the coins and the vendor’s XEM wallet was emptied.

The Two Men Are Charged With Accepting Criminal Proceeds and Participating in Organized Crime

On Wednesday, March 11, Tokyo police revealed that two men have been arrested for purchasing stolen XEM. A doctor and a company executive, both in their mid-30s, were taken into custody after it was found they had traded a variety of cryptos including BTC to acquire the stolen coins. Allegedly, the two men obtained the XEM throughout the months of February and March 2018. Further, Tokyo police accuse the men of knowingly accepting cryptocurrency that was involved in a crime.

The individuals are suspected of accepting crime proceeds and violating a law against participating in organized crime. Although another report claims the two Japanese residents, Takayoshi Doi and Masaki Kitamoto, may have admitted to being directly connected with the 523 million XEM heist. Kitamoto ostensibly admitted guilt, raking in $19 million from the incident. According to prosecutors, over 100 investigators were involved with the Coincheck hack.

The case follows the recent topical discussions revolving in the crypto community about the relevance of ‘tainted’ bitcoins and ‘virgin’ bitcoins. Following the Coincheck hack, the NEM Foundation promised it would be able to track the coins via the mosaic tracker protocol. But the stolen funds were sent to the deep web immediately and reports detailed that the hackers selling the coins built a largely automated system that sold XEM for 15-20% lower than spot prices. The stolen NEM vendors even created a ticket system for people who had issues with their transfers and they only accepted BTC and LTC. Because the hackers sold the coins in this fashion and exchanged them for BTC, and LTC, the NEM Foundation’s mosaic tracker protocol was deemed a failure.

On March 21, 2018, the foundation disabled the tracker and stopped tagging the stolen XEM. The two men arrested on Wednesday in Tokyo are the first two individuals taken into custody for their connection with the Coincheck compromise. As of now, reports of the story in Japan are somewhat conflicting and the two individuals could very well be, the hack’s primary suspects.

The company named Blockchain thinks it has found a solution. It lets you borrow money against cryptocurrencies held in your Blockchain wallet.

As soon as you lock cryptocurrencies in your wallet, you receive USD PAX, a stablecoin that is pegged against USD. You can then convert, send and do whatever you want with your stablecoins. You can pay back your loan whenever you want.

The minimum loan size is $1,000 and Blockchain requires a collateralization ratio of 200%. It means that if you want to borrow $5,000, you need to put down the equivalent of $10,000 in cryptocurrencies as collateral.

Blockchain charges interest on loans. Your interest rate may vary but the company tries to be transparent about it before you accept the loan. By default, Blockchain uses your collateral to collect interest. Be careful with the value of your cryptocurrencies, as your collateral could end up losing a ton of value even though you still owe USD.

Behind the scene, Blockchain is running a lending desk for institutional investors. The company launched this feature back in August. Blockchain thinks that it has built a strong liquidity pool that it can leverage with retail investors.

Users in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. are not eligible to the feature for now. Blockchain only accepts collateral in BTC for now.","Global energy markets could impact the future of bitcoin, but not strictly in terms of supply or demand.

On the surface, the current oil market chaos may appear to be a power struggle between Russia and Saudi Arabia, which have differing views on whether to reduce production to accommodate the slowdown or bury the U.S. shale market by making it too expensive to keep up.

“Usually when oil is cheap, the dollar is stronger. But we haven’t seen that in this crisis because of the coronavirus,” said Fadi Aboualfa, managing director of the MEES energy newsletter.

There are rumors of Iranian efforts to use cryptocurrency to circumnavigate sanctions, potentially with deals related to commodities or oil markets. So far, Russia, China and Iran have been among the most proactive nations exploring the cryptocurrency space. Even as a top oil-producing country, Russia has historically been the odd man out of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), dominated by Saudi Arabia.

These days, among cryptocurrency fans in both Russia and China, the current sentiment is outright defiance.

“Big crypto mining pools are rejecting Iranian miners because of sanctions,” said Mikhael Jerlis, CEO of the Russian EMCD.IO mining pool. “We don’t give a damn about sanctions. If we get sanctioned we’d just shut down the company and open a new one.”

Over the past three years, Saudi Arabia’s oil supply routes have increasingly come under fire. The kingdom’s hold on the shipping routes around Yemen started slipping, thanks to Iran-backed Houthi rebels conquering the most strategic parts of Yemen. It’s no wonder why, as oil markets fluctuate, the crypto-savvy alliance of China, Russia and Iran is growing impatient with U.S. sanctions and petro-dollar allies like Saudi Arabia.

“The dollar has weakened, mostly because China has been selling dollars quite liberally … in order to keep its own currency more or less stable,” said economist Daniel Lacalle. “I think there’s a part of it, in the energy markets, that is related to the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Russia.”

Where bitcoin fits in

When it comes to the prospect of using bitcoin (BTC) instead of U.S. dollars in energy markets, there are many factors beyond banking sanctions.

Compared to energy markets, bitcoin is perhaps the least correlated asset on the global economic chessboard. Bitcoin’s current price of roughly $7,900 is almost double the price at this time last year, despite market slumps sparked by the coronavirus epidemic.

On the other hand, market conditions may complicate the compliance risks associated with bitcoin.

“You could argue they [gold and the dollar] are inversely correlated,” Aboualfa said. “That could be an indication of how bitcoin will be impacted if it’s deemed to be a store-of-value asset class.”

However, he added, most OPEC players view bitcoin as a “sanctions play,” not a store of value.

It’s unclear what role cryptocurrency will play in future markets, as both the least-correlated asset class and a political pawn in the sanctions rivalry. It might raise questions related to compliance on the tangible end of any significant trade, rather than the payment rails themselves.

Meanwhile, from the perspective of an anonymous bitcoin trader in Saudi Arabia, the U.S.-Saudi bloc of this conflict appears to be ignoring cryptocurrency as a tool for global trades.

“Barely anyone is talking about it,” he said of the kingdom these days.

With regards to the oil market rivalry, he added: “Everyone’s on standby to see the impact … it’s about who can hold their breath the longest.”

Meanwhile, energy experts say incumbents are complacent about the dominance of the U.S. dollar in oil markets while others may try to force change.

“China and Russia are already trying to move away from the petro-dollar contracts,” Aboualfa said. “But the U.S. [Navy] could just stop any ship that tries to import Iranian crude. It’s not really a monetary thing.”","YouTube has deleted videos and temporarily banned the accounts of two more cryptocurrency enthusiasts citing a breach in company policy.

Earlier this week, cryptocurrency educator “Ivan on Tech” and crypto news reporter “The Moon” took to Twitter to express their anger over being censored for what they believed were overreactions by the video sharing platform.

YouTube had delivered a strike notice to both accounts, which essentially restricts the ability for content creators to upload videos, live streams or stories for a set period, based on the number of strikes received or violations committed. Both channels are back online at press time.

Other crypto-focused sites have also seen similar bans since late last year, with some commentators pointing to sensationalist headlines and promotional content as the possible cause in some cases. YouTube has also conceded in the past that its algorithms sometimes make erroneous calls.

Claiming there had been “nothing wrong with the content,” the Moon received an update for a video titled, “Warning!!! Financial crisis has begun! Bitcoin not a safe haven in this bloodbath?” He was advised his channel and video were violating the terms laid out in the “sale of regulated goods and services policy.” The policy makes no mention of digital assets, and lists items banned for sale or promotion on the platform.

The YouTuber, who has over 89,000 subscribers, declared that “while bitcoin (BTC) was censorship resistant, YouTube videos were not.”

Ivan on Tech, with 216,000 subs, tweeted Tuesday that while his YouTube account had been fully restored after calls to various departments, he would now be streaming from his own website as a result of repeated strikes from the firm. It’s not clear which video had prompted the strike.

History of errors

In late December 2019, YouTube took action against multiple accounts, erroneously purging cryptocurrency education videos from its platform before declaring to CoinDesk it had “mistakenly” removed the content in question after it had made the “wrong call.”

Following an uproar from the crypto community at the time, YouTube moved to reinstate affected cryptocurrency videos, though it’s still uncertain if all of the content in question was fully restored."

Bitcoin tanked Thursday and fell below $6,000 for the first time since May amid a larger global market sell-off as investors panic about the spread of coronavirus.

The cryptocurrency briefly fell to as low as $5,705.31, according to Bloomberg data. Later Thursday morning, the price had recovered some of its loses and traded around $5,960 — down about 25% from Wednesday's close. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index fell as much as 29%, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust lost as much as 7%.

The largest digital currency led a rout of other coins — Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple also plummeted Thursday.

""The short-term outlook for Bitcoin remains bearish, as investors are clearly not looking at Bitcoin as a safe haven asset,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of the institutional-grade platform Stack, told Business Insider in an email.

Other safe-haven assets have also slipped, reflecting that investors are not snapping them up at the same rate amid market panic. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond gained Thursday, showing that investors were selling the long-term bonds instead of buying. Gold, another safe-haven asset, was down more than 1% Thursday.

The biggest cryptocurrency slumped as much as 25% during morning trading before clawing back some of its losses. It was last down 22% at $6,206, heading for its biggest daily loss in five years.

Bitcoin has lost over 30% of its value in the last five days, outpacing sharp losses for assets from stocks to oil as the pandemic wreaks havoc on the daily life of millions.

“We’ve seen de-risking across all asset markets,” said Jamie Farquhar, portfolio manager at London-based crypto firm NKB. “Bitcoin is certainly not immune to that.”

Global stocks plunged into a bear market and oil slumped on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump banned travel from Europe to stem the coronavirus.

The highly infectious disease is spreading rapidly in Europe and increasingly in the United States, disrupting all aspects of life from education to entertainment. The World Health Organization described the outbreak as a pandemic for the first time on Wednesday.

Traders cited the rush away from risky assets as driving bitcoin’s fall.

Bitcoin’s slump underlines nagging questions over its practicality as a currency, or as a stable store of value. Those concerns, as well as worries on regulation, have kept mainstream investors away.

Prone to wild and often inexplicable price swings, it has through its 12-year life failed to take off as a means of payment, its use instead mainly limited to speculation.

(Graphic: Bitcoin plummets 25% amid global market turmoil - )

Other major cryptocurrencies, which tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, also suffered sharp falls.

No.2 coin ethereum fell 27%, while third-largest coin XRP, used in U.S. start-up Ripple’s payments system, tanked 21%.

Bitcoin’s fall has also undermined proponents’ claims that it acts as a safe haven in times of geopolitical stress.

“The narrative that BTC is a ‘safety asset’ and is more like a ‘digital gold’ has yet to get proper traction in mainstream markets outside of the crypto community,” said Ben Sebley, partner at BCB Group, a cryptocurrency brokerage.

The steep drop has pushed bitcoin deep into negative territory for 2020, after a strong start to the year.

In the first six weeks of 2020, bitcoin rose by nearly half as investors bet that a combination of arcane tech factors in its code and expectations of mainstream acceptance were leading to a repricing.","The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is set to issue warnings to hundreds of thousands of residents who may have traded cryptocurrencies.

As reported by news.com.au on Wednesday, up to 350,000 Australians will be contacted by the ATO in the coming weeks reminding them of their obligations when trading in digital assets like bitcoin (BTC).

Under Australian federal law, cryptocurrencies are considered a form of property and are thereby subject to the same regulations relating to capital gains tax.

The ATO will ask those that traded cryptocurrencies throughout the 2017–2018 financial year to review their tax forms and declare instances in which they bought, sold or traded digital assets to make it easier come tax time.

Records to keep on crypto Source: Australian Taxation Office (ATO)

As proof of trades, records kept by individuals should include exchange records, digital keys and records of agents, as well as any legal or accounting costs associated with their trading activity. Further, the agency is asking individuals to keep a record of the Australian dollar exchange rate at the time of their transactions, as this might significantly impact earnings.

The tax office is utilizing its Data Matching Protocol for cryptocurrencies, which allows it to cross-check data it has on individuals with data provided by exchanges (dubbed crypto designated service providers) in an attempt to identify those who may have misreported on previous tax returns.

“Under this program we obtain cryptocurrency transaction data from currency exchanges on taxpayers who have bought and sold cryptocurrency,” an ATO spokesman said in the report.

The planned warnings come as other tax agencies around the world move to more closely monitor for tax evasion involving cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service last summer issued similar warning letters about misreporting income from trades, and released its first guidance on crypto tax for five years in October.","Bitcoin is in turmoil on Thursday as another severe sell-off is seen in the traditional markets.

The top cryptocurrency by market value plunged to as low as $5,678 – the lowest level since May 2019 – soon before press time. That represents a 25 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. However, just as quickly, prices rebounded to over $6,550.

Meanwhile, major European equity market indices like Germany’s DAX, France’s CAC and U.K.’s FTSE 100 are down at least 6 percent at press time. Meanwhile, futures on the S&P 500 are shedding over 4.5 percent. Asian equities also took a beating with Japan’s Nikkei index losing 4.5 percent.

The risk aversion, which began two weeks ago, worsened during the Asian trading hours after President Donald Trump announced a 30-day ban on travel from most of Europe and failed to meet investor expectations for additional fiscal stimulus measures to counter the coronavirus epidemic.

While stocks and bitcoin are down, gold, a classic haven asset, is struggling to eke out gains. The yellow metal is currently trading largely unchanged on the day at $1,642 per ounce, having printed a low of $1,630 earlier.

U.S. Treasury bonds, also a safe haven under normal conditions, dropped on Wednesday, pushing yields higher despite the massive sell-off on Wall Street. The 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 10 basis points to 0.89 percent even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 5.9 percent.

The traditional safe havens are struggling right now, possibly because the institutions are liquidating positions in these assets to fund margin calls in the equity markets.

A margin call occurs when the value of the investor’s leverage account drops below the minimum margin requirement. The investor is then required to bring in additional capital or securities to build back the account up to the minimum margin requirement.

“We started seeing institutional liquidity issues today. For the first time since the beginning of the bear market neither U.S. Treasury bonds nor gold managed to hedge an S&P decline,” angel investor and Messari’s head of product Qiao Wang tweeted early Thursday.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg Markets’ Jonathan Ferro referred to Wednesday as the worst day of the last few weeks, as stocks tanked while Treasury yields rose, highlighting liquidity stress in the market.

In fact, the hunger for liquidity was so strong on Wednesday that a model portfolio of 50 percent treasuries and 50 percent stocks fell by the most on record, according to Bloomberg’s cross-asset reporter Luke Kawa.

“People are raising cash to meet redemptions and margin calls. Market liquidity is freezing up, people are struggling to trade. The buy the dip mentality has totally flipped,” Ferro tweeted during Asian trading hours.

Source of liquidity?

Some investors think bitcoin is also being treated as a source of liquidity.

“How did BTC go from being a hedge against bad stuff to getting washed out and trading like a risk asset? When things go from bad to very, very bad like they did last week, investors take leverage down as fast as they can. They book profits to make up for other losses,” billionaire investor and CEO of Galaxy Digital Michael Novogratz tweeted earlier this week as an explanation for bitcoin’s 13 percent slide in late February. The S&P 500 had suffered a double-digit drop during the same week.

Bitcoin’s futures market data validates Novogratz’s claim to some extent. The global open interest or the total number of outstanding futures contracts have dropped sharply over the last few weeks, signaling a slowdown in institutional activity.

Open interest topped out at highs above $5 billion on Feb. 14 and fell to nearly $3.8 billion to hit the lowest in nearly two months, according to Skew data.

Meanwhile, both the open interest and trading volumes in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the most liquid futures markets, have also dropped sharply over the last couple of weeks.

Open interest fell to $171 million on Wednesday, the lowest level since Jan 6, having hit a high of $338 million on Feb. 14. Trading volume also hit a three-month low of $88 million on March 6, before witnessing a brief spike on March 9.

“It looks like institutional investors are taking a break from bitcoin in this unstable period with growing fear related to the coronavirus,” according to an Arcane Research tweet.

Looking forward

With coronavirus showing no signs of a slowdown, stocks may continue to lose altitude, possibly keeping bitcoin under pressure.

Rumors are doing the rounds that the U.S. Federal Reserve may deliver another emergency rate cut before the next week’s scheduled meeting to address the liquidity issue in the market.","U.S. prosecutors indicated a Dutch national Thursday for allegedly spearheading a rape and child pornography website that’s made over $1.6 million worth of bitcoin selling videos since 2012.

Known as “Michael R.M.,” and “Mr. Dark,” the man allegedly ran a site called “DarkScandals” that operated on the darknet, which requires special software to access, and on the public clearnet. He allegedly sold over 2,000 videos and had ties to 303 virtual currency accounts, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.

Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) funded the bulk of the operation, according to the complaint against the man filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Customers allegedly sent the cryptocurrencies as payment for videos or could upload their own. Their video submissions had to follow “specific rules,” though. As detailed extensively in the complaint, the videos had to be explicitly “obscene.”

“The types of crimes described in this indictment are the most disgusting I’ve encountered in 30 years of law enforcement,” said Don Fort, chief of the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation team (IRS-CI), in a press release. “It is a special kind of evil to prey on and profit from the pain of others.”

Federal agents discovered DarkScandals while investigating the Welcome to Video case last year. That operation led to hundreds of arrests, the seizure of hundreds of thousands of videos and the dismantling of what was deemed the “largest darknet child pornography website” by investigators at the time.

It also led investigators straight to DarkScandals, the complaint said. “A subsequent review of a Washington, D.C.-based ‘Welcome to Video’ customer’s virtual currency records lead to the discovery of the DarkScandals sites.”

The case serves as another reminder that cryptocurrencies are a double-edged sword for criminals. On the one hand, transactions cannot be blocked by a regulated third party like a bank or payment processor; on the other hand, they leave a trail of crumbs for investigators that is difficult to obscure.

Agents with IRS and Homeland Security Investigations traced 303 digital currency transactions in the course of this latest investigation. The IRS had used Chainalysis’ transaction tracing software in the Welcome to Video investigation, but a spokesperson for Chainalysis declined to comment on this most recent one.

“If you thought you were anonymous, think again,” Fort said.

U.S. investigators worked in partnership with the Dutch National Police, Europol and the German Federal Criminal Police in parallel investigations, according to DOJ.","Crypto Exchanges Overwhelmed on Bitcoin’s Most Volatile Day of the Year

Binance chief Changpeng Zhao referred to it as “Bloodbath day,” and many in the cryptosphere will echo those sentiments, as fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic reverberates through global markets. As crypto exchanges were thronged by frantic traders looking to capitalize on – or seek refuge from – the unprecedented market dump, several platforms buckled under the pressure.

Exchanges Struggle as Traders Get Busy

A panic-stricken sell-off of bitcoin and other risk-on digital assets has led to a number of crypto exchanges experiencing outages. On Thursday, March 12, Binance’s CZ noted that the platform’s load was 5x greater than all previous peaks. The exchange was handling 146,500 messages per second, with a 30GB/s market data push from a lone source. Aside from the occasional glitch, Zhao says systems appear to be holding up for now. Kraken was also briefly down earlier today.

Over on Bitmex, the Seychelles-based exchange experienced the most liquidations in 16 months: $702 million worth, $698 million of which were longs. The Ethereum network, meanwhile, has been toiling under heavy network congestion, with gas prices spiking to as high as $3.70 today, and transactions waiting hours to be processed. Binance has temporarily increased withdrawal fees for ETH and ERC20 tokens.

Network activity has been driven up by traders seeking to sell their holdings and under-collateralized defi positions being forcibly liquidated. ETH also nosedived by 35%, its most significant one-day decline since 2018. The price of BTC, meanwhile, fell below $6,000 for the first time since May while altcoins also plummeted. Against this wild backdrop, we have a halving on the horizon.

Bitcoin’s Safe Haven Status in Question

The theory that bitcoin might be a safe haven as oil, stocks, equities and bond yields plunge has been disproved: but even gold, widely viewed as the ultimate safe haven asset, dropped by more than 1% on Changpeng Zhao’s aptly-titled Bloodbath Day. Most crypto traders are seeking refuge by switching into stablecoins while knife-catchers have been buying up cheap coins in anticipation of the next rally. Volatility remains a trader’s best friend. As Bitmex’s Arthur Hayes put it, “I know all you HODLers say you love “cheap coins”, but will you really back up the truck if the S&P is flirting with 2,000? We shall see.” He added:

The time to back up the truck is when the futures basis goes flat or negative. That will signal an evaporation of optimism. Then you must surf the tidal wave of free money, and begin buying crypto with both hands. First fill your Bitcoin handbags, then acquire all the other dog shit … even CRipple might pop. Long live volatility, and stay healthy.

To say the economy has experienced turbulence in the wake of coronavirus would be a gross understatement. Assets are in virtual freefall across traditional and crypto markets, with pledges by the Fed and the Bank of England to cut interest rates seeming to have little effect.

Cruise liner and airline stocks have been some of the worst hit, with Boeing’s stock dropping 50% from last year. Numerous flights have been cancelled, and President Trump has announced a travel ban on 26 European countries in an attempt to contain the virus. Italy, one of the worst-hit countries, has come to an eerie standstill, all shops and restaurants except pharmacies and food outlets closed to the public. Many believe their own nations will soon follow suit, as infection spreads at a frightening pace.

Although the short-term outlook for bitcoin remains bearish, and sentiments like “keep calm and HODL” have been doing the rounds on Crypto Twitter, the sense of frenzy is impossible to ignore. As Messari’s Ryan Selkis urged, “It’s ugly today, but this too shall pass. Stay safe. Keep building.”

Headquartered in Seattle, Wash., we have been feeling the effects of the first viral hotspot in the U.S. for the last few weeks.

As a GeekWire reader, you’re likely familiar with the coronavirus situation and its broader impact to the global economy. If you’d like a refresher, we’ve done a deep dive on our blog. The abridged version is that the impacts from the coronavirus are just beginning to be felt and will be long lasting. We must flatten the curve of infection to ensure stability of our medical system.

We’d like to focus on our area of expertise: cryptocurrency. How will all the chaos in the world impact the price of bitcoin? No one knows. And anyone that claims differently is selling you a bag of goods.

This asset class is experimental and thus entirely speculative, and despite being labeled as a safe haven asset immune from the whims of the global economy, bitcoin did not exist during the 2008 economic crisis. Ironically, it was formed out of the ashes of that spectacle and has existed solely in a risk-on global macro climate. Given that bitcoin has never existed during any form of global financial turmoil, there are zero data points to extrapolate from.

Over the last few weeks, bitcoin’s price action has followed closely in line with regular markets, surprising many and damaging the notion of bitcoin’s lack of correlation. When we started working on this piece, the price of Bitcoin was hovering around $8,000 and in the following 24 hours has fallen more than 25% to $6,000. Global markets are scared and behaving as if investors are running for the exits on almost everything.

Bitcoin fall victim to the COVID-19 panic. I truly did not see that coming, I thought it might act as a safe haven asset. $BTCUSD — John Bollinger (@bbands) March 9, 2020

Crypto needs a significant amount of new capital to enter the space to break out of the global downtrend that began at the end of 2017. A major question we keep asking is where does that capital come from?

Retail investors entered en-masse during the great crypto bubble of 2017 with huge inflows of capital. As that bubble popped, many of those retail investors lost significant sums of capital and have grown skeptical and impatient with the asset class. Those that remained experienced repeated false excitement of another 2017-style bull market only to be met with incredible selling. This has become maddening for many.

Coronavirus Live Updates: The latest COVID-19 developments in Seattle and the world of tech

We expect that many retail investors are so underwater that “hodling” will persist, but we have limited expectations that they add substantial sums to their positions, particularly as other investments fall off a cliff. Others will give up entirely, the pain of astronomical drawdowns too much to bear.

At $6,000, bitcoin is down ~16% year to date and ~68% from its Dec. 17, 2017 all-time high, underperforming the S&P over that same period of time by ~100%.

The entry of large-scale institutional capital has long been pointed as the saving force since those December 2017 highs. That capital is always believed by many to be just 3-to-6 months away. We believe we are likely much further away from major institutional inflows given the current economic landscape combined with the current regulatory environment, and a number of other issues. Institutional allocators have other fires and little reason to embark on further diligence of a small, speculative, experimental asset class at the moment — particularly one that does not have a sufficient track record or established relationship within the broader system of financial markets.

One argument that you hear frequently is that the looming bitcoin halving will cause a dramatic rise in the value of bitcoin. This has been widely popularized by the “Stock to Flow (S2F) model” — a model we don’t think particularly highly of. A popular narrative within the cryptocurrency space is as follows:

“The halving of mining rewards has the effect of reducing sell pressure from miners which in turn creates an imbalance in supply and demand that then facilitates a dramatic escalation of price.”

With few people buying, and with miners selling, there are enormous headwinds facing the bitcoin markets.

However, after completing an analysis of prior halvings, we found that there is limited impact of a halving event on pricing action. It appears more likely that the return behavior before, during, and after a halving coincided more with increasing levels of speculation than with an underlying shift in sell side pressure.

In our view, it is not possible to make statistically meaningful claims regarding the impact of the halving given that there only exist two prior data points. The last two halvings occurred in 2012 and 2016 with markets (both crypto and traditional) that were dramatically different in nature. Bitcoin has moved from a world of hobbyist miners into the world of industrial-scale miners that utilize all of the financial tools at their disposal (i.e. options, futures, lending). Further, neither of the previous two halvings occurred while the global economy stood on the precipice of a recession.

That said, we do believe the halving will have some measurable impact on the broader cryptocurrency space. Cutting miner income in half creates incredible economic pressures on the mining industry. This industry has thrived with access to cheap credit and the benefit of a significant profit premium over the last few years — two beneficial conditions that are about to come to an end. We believe selling pressure could be on the horizon as miners face a confluence of factors, including damage to balance sheets, limited availability of financing and a reduction of mining rewards.

With few people buying, and with miners selling, there are enormous headwinds facing the bitcoin markets.

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” — Theodore Roosevelt

Despite those major headwinds, there will be a recovery, of that we are certain. It is possible the speed of that recovery may disappoint many looking for quick riches. However, bitcoin and the broader digital asset class is here to stay, wild price swings and all. These technologies power an entirely new and fascinating world of assets. Financial rewards exist for those that appreciate the risks and opportunities created by these disruptive assets. There is power in humility and opportunity within crisis.

Expect the unexpected and please be safe out there.",
2020-03-13,"The cryptocurrency briefly dropped below $4,000 Friday after starting the week above $9,000. It later recovered to roughly $5,400 as of the close of U.S. markets. Bitcoin Futures, meanwhile, were on pace for its worst week since debuting in December 2017.

The world's first and most widely held cryptocurrency dropped 50% over the past two days. Bitcoin — sometimes referred to as ""digital gold"" — fell more than 30% Friday to its weakest level since March 2019, according to data from CoinDesk.

The digital currency had been trading near the $10,000 level in mid-February. The slide began later in the month alongside global markets reeling from the quickly spreading coronavirus.

""Bitcoin's recent price action is primarily a result of the coronavirus outbreak affecting global markets and driving investors towards the safety of cash,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto investment firm BitBull Capital. ""With this sharp decline, Bitcoin's potential as a safe-haven asset is being questioned, but we believe it is too early to seek any correlations between Bitcoin and other asset classes.""

The bitcoin nosedive came amidst volatile trading on Wall Street this week. On Thursday, stocks saw their worst since the ""Black Monday"" market crash in 1987. Stocks rose sharply Friday afternoon on the possibility of fiscal stimulus from governments around the world.

Other cryptocurrencies also dropped this week. The world second largest digital currency, ethereum, fell 46% this week while XRP lost nearly 40% of its value.","Bitcoin (BTC) recovered slightly from Thursday’s brutal selloff as global financial markets creep back into the green.

After dipping below $4,000, the world’s leading cryptocurrency posted some gains and is currently trading at $5,431 as of 20:00 UTC Friday. While bitcoin is still down 15 percent over the last 24 hours, traders started buying after it hit a 12-month low of $3,855 around 02:00 UTC on Coinbase.

On the one hand, the timing of the turnaround supports the notion that bitcoin is more correlated with traditional markets than its advocates have long believed.

“The rally from the low coincided with a turn in the equities market,” noted Max Boonen, CEO of B2C2, a London-based over-the-counter (OTC) market maker.

Indeed, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index chart shows green candles, a sign there are more buyers than sellers, appearing at 02:00 UTC, around the time of the buying on Coinbase. Equities in other markets are seeing gains, as in the U.S. the S&P 500 is up 9 percent as of 20:00 UTC.

On the other hand, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s New York branch announced a $1.5 trillion injection of cash into the financial systems Thursday, and that news had traders thinking bitcoin still has major potential as an inflation haven even though in trying times cash and a steady diet of government bonds seems to be what people want.

“Eventually, as QE washes the globe with more fiat, BTC will come into its own. The fundamental reason why BTC exists is even more strong now,” said Jack Tan of algorithmic trading firm Kronos Research, referring to the quantitative easing policies employed by central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis.

Cryptocurrency whales, those with large stakes, seem to be moving coins around more often than usual, as Binance saw 1,702 BTC of inflows March 8 while bitcoin’s price was still up near $8,000. Since then, a tumble downward has left bitcoin in a $4,600 to $5,900 range, and some are salivating at a buying opportunity.

“Traders of all types – institutional, prosumer, retail and everyone in between – are taking advantage of value investing opportunities in an oversold market that is fundamentally sound and ripe for recovery in the not-too-distant future,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, a London-based digital asset firm.

Trading in other leading cryptocurrencies, such as ether (ETH), down 6 percent, and XRP (XRP), in the red 6 percent over the last 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC, indicates uncertainty is still the name of the game.

“We expect prices to recover, though the current geopolitical environment and evolving coronavirus outbreak make the timing and size of that recovery a bit uncertain,” Bequant’s Vinokourov added.

Traders always struggle to time the market, and cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. They want to buy in at these prices, but are keeping a close eye on bitcoin’s gyrations.

Henrik Kugelberg, an active OTC trader based in Sweden, is busy making cryptocurrency purchases. However, he cautioned that U.S. President Donald Trump’s often mercurial decision-making could throw a spanner in the works.",These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,"William Mougayar, a CoinDesk columnist, is the author of “The Business Blockchain,” producer of the Token Summit and a venture investor and adviser.

We should stop trying to define or classify cryptocurrency as if it were a beast from another planet. Rather, we just need to accept it as the future of money. It is a currency, not a security, and it shouldn’t be governed by securities laws. The dollar, euro, yuan, pound are not regulated by securities authorities.

​There is little value in attempting to define, box-in, segment or categorize cryptocurrency as something that needs to be continuously examined, questioned and analyzed. Instead, let’s focus on promoting cryptocurrency’s adoption because it is here to flourish and stay.

At a recent DLD 2020 panel, entitled “Virtual Currencies & the Global Financial System,” the first question from the moderator consisted of “defining cryptocurrencies.” Each of the three panelists (painfully) took a shot at suggesting their own definitions. Another panel from Davos 2020, “From Token Assets to a Token Economy,” discussed tokens as a type of cryptocurrency. In both panels, the definitions tried to depict tokens and cryptocurrency as a new type of animal.

Is there a point trying to classify the various types of cryptocurrencies, really?

Cryptocurrency is just like any currency, except with more powerful properties. It is that degree of power that is scaring incumbents while exciting new participants.

Over the long term and in the end-state, cryptocurrency is going to be as pervasively used as today’s currency, but with a rivaling variety. Today we see cryptocurrency as the future of money, but tomorrow it will be an integral part of money.

Email was new until it wasn’t. E-commerce was a novelty until it no longer was. Filing taxes electronically or renewing licenses online was a rarity until it became routine and sometimes the only option. Online banking was innovative until it became routine. Meeting friends online was extraordinary until it became very common. Reading online news was a parallel activity to printed newspapers until it became the norm for billions of people.

Today, cryptocurrency is an anomaly whose usage and understanding are in the hands of the few. Soon enough, it will permeate our society, habits, business, government, and become second nature.

The rabbit hole of classifications

If you go down the rabbit hole of classifications, you quickly realize the resulting madness and confusion from the nomenclature jargon: stablecoins, staked currency, utility tokens, security tokens, native coins, digital rights tokens, non-fungible tokens, etc.

There are stablecoins and market-driven coins. Stablecoins, like the name implies are coins with less volatility (supported by algorithmic or asset-backing stability), whereas non-stablecoins are subject to market supply/demand price fluctuations.

Cryptocurrency can be government or non-government backed. Government-backed cryptocurrency is still a rarity, and the subject of more discussion than action. As an aside, it will end up as a centrally controlled digital currency rather than being decentralized, programmable and native to a given blockchain.

Sadly, we have invented many of these classifications to please regulators.

We also have tokens that are in essence cryptocurrencies with a purpose. Then we enter the legal sphere, where tokens get labeled a utility, or security, based on how they were initially created, who received them and their ultimate functionality. For most tokens, there is a blurred line in demarcating the distinction between exclusive utility and their security-like properties of tokens.

Somewhere between a utility and security, we also have non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are representations of unique ownership of a digital asset that has no physical equivalent (such as a CryptoKitty or a games related artifact like a special tank or sword.)

Sadly, we have invented many of these classifications to please regulators. With tokens, regulators and governments get agitated because companies can now issue tokens as currency, whereas issuing money used to be the sole right of sovereign governments. But companies have been issuing stock for decades. A stock is another form of value that cryptographic tokens mimic when they function as a security.

Then, we enter discussions about the functionality of these tokens: can they be earned? Sold? Bought? Spent? Awarded? Are they a payment unit? Or a right to a privileged action (like voting or getting access to information). Will their value increase if you don’t use them and just store them? Are they native to a blockchain network, or grafted on top of an existing platform or singular application?

The above classifications are what we currently see, and there may be new representations we haven’t seen yet. While some of these functions are distinct from one another, many of them overlap with each other. That is why classifying cryptocurrency is not that useful, because we are still in the formation stages.

Reality check. Stop defining.

Time for a reality check. Do we still attempt to define the internet? Not anymore. But in its early days, we did…until we didn’t anymore.

Do we define money by its use cases, like something you buy groceries or pay a toll with? Or do we, rather, define money by its properties?

Money’s key properties consist of being a unit and a store of value that is transferable, fungible, verifiable, divisible and scarce.

Cryptocurrency inherits all these properties, in addition to adding unique functions that money doesn’t have: its immutability is digital (the physical is gone), it can be fungible or non-fungible, its policy governance doesn’t need to be centralized, it has very powerful programmable capabilities with imbedded logic (if-this-then-that), and its transferability is peer-to-peer (without central intermediaries). In essence, cryptocurrency is money on steroids.

Let us start using cryptocurrency according to its most common features first, the ones that it shares with the money we know. Then we can evolve from there. Just like early websites were glorified brochures on a screen, then we evolved way beyond that monochromatic use case into e-commerce, e-business, two-way communications, social interactions and much more.

Using cryptocurrency hasn’t been easy for the average person, and that’s a valid challenge. But it is getting better.

It is time to give cryptocurrency the place it deserves. If it is to claim a position as the new money, then we need to increase its usage, starting with the easier use cases and gradually increasing the variety and complexity.

We need to bring cryptocurrencies to the fore and make them as popular as regular currency and web are.

Let us stop defining and segmenting cryptocurrency in ways that limit it. Rather, let’s start using it in ways that open up the possibilities and allow it to cement itself in our lives and businesses so it is accepted, welcomed and not feared.","Cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase announced on Thursday it has launched Bitcoin transaction batching, which is a new feature that reduces the load that the platform puts on the Bitcoin blockchain and may actually save uses more than 50% on network fees. Coinbase further explained:

“We will be bundling multiple sends into a single transaction — we anticipate that this will reduce our load on the Bitcoin network by more than 50%, and the network fees our customers pay will automatically be reduced by an equivalent amount when sending. This update requires no action from customers, who will immediately see reduced network fees. This release will introduce a small delay in a transaction being broadcast to the network, but will not impact the time it takes for transactions to be confirmed at the normal rate for customers.”

The transaction batching works by doing the following:

“The Bitcoin network processes transactions by packaging them into blocks and adding these blocks to the end of the blockchain. Each of these blocks has a fixed capacity (in bytes), and one is created every 10 minutes, on average. It is this limited supply of block space, and increasing demand for transaction processing, that leads to high fees.”

Coinbase then noted that a single transaction that fulfills multiple users sends requests occupies less space in each block than each being processed individually. The platform added that Bitcoin transaction batching is being rolled out now, and will be applied to both Coinbase and Coinbase Pro. For Coinbase Pro customers, 100% of network fees are already covered.","San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has started grouping multiple bitcoin transactions together, rather than issuing sends one by one.

The adoption of “batching,” the firm said in a blog post Thursday, will mean less strain is put on the Bitcoin blockchain from large numbers of transactions arising from the popular exchange. The move will further reduce transaction fees for customers, according to the post.

“We anticipate that this will reduce our load on the Bitcoin network by more than 50 percent, and the network fees our customers pay will automatically be reduced by an equivalent amount when sending,” wrote Eli Haims, Coinbase product manager.

Batching is already live, with the firm warning that it will add a “small delay” in sends being broadcast to the network, but will not impact the time it takes for users’ transactions to be confirmed.

The change will have its effect by reducing the number of transaction that need to be processed by the many, but still limited, number of computers supporting the network. In times of high use, bitcoin can become congested, with users needing to pay higher fees in order to get their transactions verified.

Historically, when bitcoin’s price is peaking, the market becomes more busy and fees often rise in conjunction. Fees have been stable and relatively low since last year, but peaked to record levels as bitcoin rose to an all-time high in late 2017.

Notably, the recent turmoil in the markets prompted by the coronavirus’ potential hit on the global economy has seen a sharp rise in fees, apparently as investors and traders moved in large numbers to liquidate their holdings.","Bitcoin (BTC) has made a quick bounce from a dip to below $4,000 seen early on Friday.

The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $5,415, up around 40 percent from the low of $3,867 reached around 02:15 UTC. That was the lowest level since March 25, 2019, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Equity markets are also flashing green alongside the slight recovery for bitcoin.

S&P 500 futures are currently reporting more than 3 percent gains, while the Euro Stoxx 50 index – the eurozone’s benchmark index – has added more than 2 percent to its value.

Asian markets had gapped lower at the open, tracking the overnight losses on Wall Street, but recovered a major portion of the losses before the closing bell.

Year-to-date losses

While bitcoin’s recovery looks impressive, the cryptocurrency is still down by more than $2,000 from levels near $8,000 seen early on Thursday.

Bitcoin is now reporting a 27 percent loss on a year-to-date basis after showing gains of 46 percent just a month ago when the cryptocurrency was trading near $10,500.

Back then, bitcoin was outshining gold by a notable margin, as the yellow metal was flashing a 6 percent gain for 2020. However, as of March 13, gold is back on top with a 7.5 percent year-to-date gain.

The yearly gains were shed as the cryptocurrency plummeted by nearly 39 percent on Thursday during the relentless coronavirus-led sell-off in risk assets. The resulting liquidity crisis was accentuated by a massive long squeeze (forced liquidations) on prominent crypto derivatives exchanges such as BitMEX.

Corrective bounce?

Bitcoin’s sudden crash to $3,867 from $8,000 looked overstretched as per technical studies.

“The latest bitcoin correction has pushed BTC to oversold levels last seen in September 2019 and November 2019,” co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Jason A. Williams tweeted today.

Indeed, the widely tracked relative strength index (RSI), which oscillates between zero to 100, had dropped to 15 – the lowest since November 2018. A below-30 reading indicates the cryptocurrency is oversold.

As a result, the rise seen over the last few hours could be an “oversold bounce,” which occurs when investors view a preceding sell-off as too severe and ease selling pressure by squaring off short positions.

Focus on risk sentiment

“Bitcoin will regain poise with risk assets, which will start seeing a sustainable recovery once there is stabilization in the coronavirus infection curve,” Mike Alfred, co-founder, and CEO of Digital Assets Data told CoinDesk.

As per the latest reports, coronavirus continues to spread in Europe and the U.S. Therefore, the current uptick in the equity markets could be a chart-driven bounce or investors may have taken heart from the Federal Reserve’s decision to inject $1.4 trillion worth of liquidity into the financial system.

If the recovery gathers momentum during the U.S. trading hours, bitcoin could very well find acceptance above $6,000 once more.

However, as long as the virus outbreak shows no signs of slowing down, the risk of further downside moves in equities and bitcoin would remain high.

Still, dips below $5,000 would be transient, according to Alfred, as there is too much fundamental demand from long-term holders – investors who bought bitcoins before the massive rally from $6,000 to $20,000 seen in the fourth quarter of 2017 and during the last five weeks of 2018.

Currently, there are 12.19 million addresses that acquired coins below $5,700, according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.

These players could increase their exposure on price drops below $5,000, especially with the miners’ reward halving (a bitcoin supply cut) due in two months.

Alfred said the price range of $2,500 to $5,000 offers incredible value for investors.

Bottom in?

The bear market, which began at the end of 2013, ran out of steam at the 200-week average in 2015. Back then, the average was placed near $220.

The sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017 also ended at the 200-week MA in December 2018.

The long lower wick attached to the current weekly candle suggests seller exhaustion below the 200-week average. If history is a guide, bitcoin looks to have found a bottom below $4,000.

That does not necessarily imply a v-shaped recovery to $10,000. If the equities resume their sell-off, prices might revisit sub-$5,000 levels.","Although it’s difficult to quantify demand for bitcoin (BTC) in informal markets across the Middle East, small-scale traders from Lebanon to Yemen say interest in bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, not a speculative asset, is stronger than ever.

Rami Mohammad Ali, a bitcoin miner and trader based in the Palestinian area of East Jerusalem, said the sell side of the local peer-to-peer market dried up and the buy side exploded in March.

So far, he’s sold a cumulative total of 30 bitcoin to 90 customers. That’s a significant increase from September 2019, when he said he sold roughly 20 bitcoin a month to 50 customers.

The appeal of holding value in bitcoin, he said, is that people can access “the money any time they need it.”

This appears to be true across the region. One anonymous Syrian trader with family in Lebanon said small Lebanese business owners are struggling to pay their invoices abroad. So, among the few Lebanese with family abroad and the necessary computer skills, some now “buy [bitcoin] locally with cash and liquidate it abroad through friends and family to pay their invoices.”

In fact, some Middle Eastern bitcoin traders reported relative newbies are learning quickly and looking to buy bitcoin this week, as global prices dip.

Meanwhile, in Tehran, an anonymous Iranian bitcoiner said people now “tend to keep their assets in gold, dollars and housing, plus a little bitcoin.” Due to the coronavirus outbreak in Iran, the economic situation has gotten progressively worse. This means fewer public bitcoin meetups and quieter trades among a population with even less faith in national institutions. Small-scale bitcoin mining is now commonplace, locals say, despite the challenges faced by industrial operations.

“Bitcoin is a revolutionary product but it needs a few more revolutions,” the Tehran-based bitcoiner said. “In the past, people thought bitcoin was a new type of scam. Now bitcoin is more trusted.”

The analytics firm Gate Trade estimated there are now more than 30 Iranian companies using bitcoin, instead of fiat, for cross-border deals. But a Gate Trade spokesperson declined to specify which companies because the greatest barrier to bitcoin adoption in the Middle East appears to be international sanctions. That challenge isn’t limited to Iran.

Yemeni bitcoin trader Mohammed Alsobhi said roughly five civilians continue to buy a small amount of bitcoin each month. The bitcoin market in Yemen is much smaller and quieter than most in the region due to the widespread censorship of telecommunication networks. But there is interest among locals knowledgeable about computer science.

“If I had the capabilities available in developed countries, I would have made great progress in this field,” Alsobhi said of selling bitcoin in his war-torn nation. “Most companies that deal globally … are excluding Yemen.”

He said he hopes people in Yemen will gain access to crypto markets for trading opportunities. But, he added, war is the biggest barrier to bitcoin adoption in his country because of sanctions. For example, due to compliance concerns, he said people in Yemen cannot download wallets via Google Play.

Crypto-curious civilians are barred from the system as the sanction’s collateral damage.

Sanctions' impact

Yemen offers a microcosm of the global challenges civilians face using decentralized monetary networks.

Stepping back, a currency war emerged from Yemen’s civil war between Iran-backed Houthi rebels, which conquered the former capital city of Sana’a, and the Saudi-aligned Central Bank of Yemen, now in Aden. Yemenites don’t trust either side. Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman recently accused President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi of being just another pawn under “the Saudi occupation.”

As such, sanctions have ripple effects for civilians trapped between failing banks and warring parties. Yemen’s United Nations representative, Abdullah Al-Saadi, accused the Houthi militants of consorting with the ultimate target of U.S. sanctions, the armed forces of Iran.

“The militias continue to welcome Iranian experts and receive military support and weapons from Iran,” Al-Saadi said in a U.N. Security Council meeting in February.

With widespread reports of Houthi looting and the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the idea of digital cash appeals to some tech-savvy Yemenites in urban areas.

“Most of the population of Yemen is in [Houthi]-controlled areas, and are engaged in the bulk of economic activity in the country,” said Hassan Al-Haifi, an ex-banker based in Sana’a. “Cryptocurrency or e-money could help Yemenites under a formidable siege and blockade. … Sana’a would be favorable to a more autonomous currency regime.”

Ben Freeman, a former Goldman Sachs oil trader and CEO of Creo Commodities, said cryptocurrency’s value in the region relies on being decentralized and censorship-resistant. He doesn’t believe bitcoin’s current volatility has any impact on that value proposition, especially in light of the risk Yemen’s civil war presents for Saudi Arabian oil production.

“Extreme market sell-offs generally hit most asset classes as assets are sold to generate collateral for losing positions,” Freeman said. “If institutions break down, and bitcoin is independent to any institution or government oversight, then we’ll start to see more flight to bitcoin as an asset class.”

The hurdles preventing local adoption in the Middle East aren’t the lack of opportunity or demand; they are primarily the byproduct of political conditions. In Yemen and Iran, bitcoiners may need to avoid both domestic and international compliance risks. Most fintech companies overlook Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, even without sanctions. As such, there are few comprehensive or clear datasets related to usage beyond global (and heavily regulated) crypto exchanges.

This makes local markets hard to quantify. Still, it doesn’t appear that broader market dips reduced demand on the ground for over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Institutional players fleeing bitcoin have little impact on demand from grassroots Middle Eastern networks. To the contrary, lower prices present an opportunity for buyers in emerging markets.","The big drop in bitcoin’s (BTC) price Thursday was in the making since March 8, data on the flow of funds into exchanges indicates.

The biggest cryptocurrency by market value collapsed from $7,900 to a 10-month low of $4,700 on Thursday and extended the decline to 12-month lows below $3,900 early Friday.

Data provided by blockchain analysis firm CryptoQuant shows inflows into major exchanges, or deposits, began rising at higher-than-usual rate beginning March 8. One way to read this is as a possible co-ordinated action by whales to dump the cryptocurrency.

BTC inflows all exchanges

X-axis represents the block number, a proxy for time

The left side Y-axis is bitcoin's price.

The right side Y-axis is the number of incoming coins into all exchanges.

Coins began flowing into exchanges at a faster rate starting from block number 620.8K, mined on March 8. Prior to that block, the average inflow per transaction was about 1,000 BTC. But after that, inflows ranged from 1.500 to 6,000 BTC in the run-up to Thursday’s price drop.

Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency’s slide began with a near 10 percent drop on March 8. In the following three days, BTC posted marginal losses – before plunging by a staggering 39 percent on Thursday

The implication is that whales – individuals, or entities, that hold large amounts of digital currencies – started moving coins from wallets to exchanges at least four days in advance of the dump.

Binance BTC inflows

A similar pattern can be seen at the world’s largest exchange, Binance. Prior to 620.817K, the average inflow per block was about 100 BTC. After that point in time, inflows ranged from 130 to 1,702 BTC in almost every block.

Notably, that huge inflow of 1,702 BTC was observed in block number 620.965 when bitcoin’s price was trading near $8,000.

Again, the data suggests big players had begun preparing for the massive liquidation since March 8.

BitMEX BTC inflows

Similarly, inflows into BitMEX fluctuated between 97 and 1,994 BTC from block numbers 620.8K to 621.3K.

One transaction, for 1,000 BTC, was recorded in block number 621,256 when bitcoin’s price was hovering around $7,900.

Lead indicator?

It is doubtful anybody could have predicted the magnitude of the sell-off seen on Thursday. That said, the increased inflow of BTC into exchanges was a sign the big sellers were getting ready to offload their holdings, which usually translates into big price slide."
2020-03-14,"Crypto Networks Stress Tested During Bitcoin’s Wild Week

Crypto valuations haven’t been the only casualties of this week’s market crash; crypto networks have also felt the strain. As onchain activity has ramped up in response to the market slump, fees have soared and the mempool filled on the BTC and ETH chains. Other crypto networks have operated smoothly, however, despite the pandemonium.

Mempool Fills on Bitcoin’s Most Volatile Day in a Year

As bitcoin lost 50% of its value on Black Thursday, traders rushed to move coins out of cold storage and swap them for stablecoins on crypto exchanges. The increased network activity fueled a surge in BTC and ETH fees, which were significantly higher than usual on March 12-13.

On Thursday, gas prices passed $3.70 on Ethereum, while Bitcoin’s mempool was backed up with enough transactions to fill over 30 blocks. The congestion on both networks has since abated, with ETH gas prices back to just over 2 cents and the mempool down from 120,000 unconfirmed transactions on its March 12 peak to the daily average of 70,000 at press time. BTC fees, meanwhile, which rose to 75 sats/byte for 1-2 block inclusion on March 13, are down to ~60sats/byte, which is still more than double their weekly average.

Bitcoin Cash and Dogecoin Networks Keep Ticking Over

Fees on Bitcoin Cash have remained low all week, despite the increase in exchange inflows and outflows. At press time, the BCH network is 1,420x cheaper than BTC when transaction fees are compared in USD. Over 18,000 BCH transactions were sent on March 12, rising to 20K the following day as the markets began to heat up.

Dogecoin has had a good week, holding up well as most other cryptos were shedding 50%. Dogecoin’s increased trade volume appears to have been in response to rising BTC and ETH fees, prompting traders to use DOGE to transfer value between exchanges, as was the case in 2017 when the crypto market was making violent moves in the opposite direction. On March 10, DOGE peaked at 33K onchain transactions, and has recorded 29K transactions in the last 24 hours, with a median fee of just $0.00168.

When the median fee for transacting on all measurable crypto networks is compared, BTC is the most expensive, at $0.117, followed by Lisk ($0.0836) and then Ethereum ($0.0409). Bitcoin Cash ($0.000831) and Dogecoin ($0.00169) are two of the cheapest according to Messari. The cheapest networks of all to transact on are the relatively centralized chains that do not utilize Proof of Work: Stellar ($0.000000385) and Ripple ($0.00000183). Panic selling was not the sort of mass adoption that crypto proponents had in mind. It has nevertheless proven a good test of how crypto networks hold up when the going gets tough.

As the price of BTC dropped significantly to below $4000, COO of Fintech firm Two Prime, Alexander S. Blum, argued that the recent increase in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending “exponentially exacerbated the price drop.”

Blum, a former technical advisor at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, revealed that most investors who are borrowing against their Bitcoin are using it to purchase more of the cryptocurrency.

So similar to what happened during the global financial crisis in 2008 (during the subprime mortgage crisis), the global capital market fluctuations triggered a ripple effect where leveraged positions were liquidated and no one was able to meet their margin calls, Blum explained.

He went on to note that as governments run out of ways to artificially support the economy (US government recently printed $1.5 trillion in cash), the financial markets will begin to see the strengths and advantages of BTC’s algorithmic value creation.

Blum has spent the eight years managing cryptocurrency funds and various projects in the blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) sector.

In statements shared with Crowdfund Insider, Blum noted:

“The increased panic caused by the spread of the Coronavirus and general economic environment are causing traders to liquidate their non-core assets. For many people, that’s Bitcoin. However, the fall in the price of Bitcoin was further accelerated by two things.”

He continued:

“Firstly, the positions on crypto derivatives platforms — some of which infamously allow for 100x leverage — are being liquidated when the price dropped. In panic, those who had their positions liquidated sold even more Bitcoin in order to cover their positions.”

He further noted:

“Secondly, DeFi lending and lending on Bitcoin have been growing massively in the last couple of years. Usually, those who are lending on Bitcoin use the cash to buy more Bitcoin. For these loans, when the price of BTC goes down and there’s a margin call, the borrower can either 1) give the lender more cash to restock the collateral or 2) the lender can sell the collateral to get back to a position that covers the loan.”

Because most borrowers are using these loans to purchase BTC, option 1 won’t help with restocking the collateral. That’s why lenders have been selling off Bitcoin to meet these collateralized loans and cover their positions, which has led to a major drop in the leading cryptocurrency’s price.

Blum pointed out:

“All these factors set off a perfect storm that is similar to what happened in 2008, but on a smaller scale. Price fluctuations set off a ripple effect where leveraged positions are being liquidated and no one can meet their margin calls.”

He argued that this is “an excellent time to buy Bitcoin.”

He believes that the fundamentals of BTC remain the same.

Long-time BTC holders (or “hodlers”) are still hodling Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency is “not going to disappear,” Blum argued.

He also mentioned that the halvening, which will reduce Bitcoin’s circulating supply by 50%, is still anticipated for sometime in May 2020, and that will have “a positive effect on the BTC price.”

He added:","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has filed charges against Dutch national Michael Rahim Mohammad, also known as “Mr. Dark”, for operating Dark Scandals, a group of Bitcoin-funded websites depicting child pornography and rape videos.

Mohammad faces charges on various counts of distribution of child pornography, production and transportation of obscene matters for sale or distribution, engaging in the business of selling or transferring obscene matter, and laundering of monetary instruments.

The indictment [PDF download] contains disturbing descriptions and language about the content of the videos. According to Don Fort, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation,

“The types of crimes described in this indictment are the most disgusting I’ve encountered in 30 years of law enforcement. It is a special kind of evil to prey on and profit from the pain of others.”

Mohmmad was the administrator of the Dark Scandals sites, which he began operating in 2012.

DarkScandals Clearnet, accessible using standard browsers and .com URLs, as well as DarkScandals Darknet, not accessible through regular internet browsing, were funded with the two most popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Users were required to pay for content in cryptocurrency that offered the illusion of anonymity. However, law enforcement has been able to trace the Bitcoin and Ethereum payments back to 303 user accounts.

According to the forfeiture complaint [PDF download], Mohammad received almost $2 million from the enterprise. The complaint seeks to return the funds to the victims.

Both sites were virtually identical, offering paying customers access to over 2,000 videos depicting child pornography, rape and sexual violence. They advertised “real blackmail, rape and forced videos of girls all around the world.”

The sites also allowed users to upload videos, with rules requesting “real rape/forced” content, and “own made material.” The sites did not allow “fake, amateur…or acted movies” and would reject content without sexual violence.

The investigation was jointly investigated by the IRS-CI (Washington, D.C.) and Homeland Security Investigations (Colorado Springs and The Hague). The Dutch National Police of the Netherlands, Europol, and the German Federal Criminal Police provided assistance.

Says Fort,

“Criminals should know if you leave a digital footprint, we will find you. If you exploit our children, we will put you behind bars. If you thought you were anonymous, think again. The dark web is not quite as dark today due to the hard work of IRS-CI and our partner agencies.”

Gitcoin, the leading crowdfunding platform for Ethereum development, has announced that its next round of fundraising will include a category focused on public health in response to the Coronavirus pandemic.

Projects related to Coronavirus resistance will be categorized under Gitcoin’s new “Public Health” category, which includes medical research projects and relief efforts.

Donations Will Be Matched

Gitcoin has set aside $50,000 worth of funding for its Public Health Round, and it hopes to accumulate at least $100,000. Those funds will be given to participants based on Gitcoin’s donation matching system.

Gitcoin Grants Round 5 (starting 3/23) will include at least a $50K Public Health Round. Read more below for details. pic.twitter.com/ERmca71ScU — Gitcoin (@gitcoin) March 13, 2020

Because Gitcoin’s announcement is less than a day old, no health projects have been accepted yet. However, Gitcoin is inviting the public to refer any relevant projects to the fundraiser, adding that it will work with partners to “review submissions on a case-by-case basis.”

Beyond Open-Source Software

Although Gitcoin is currently focused on supporting open-source software development, it is looking to expand its platform to other public goods.

In a conversation between Gitcoin CEO Kevin Owocki and Crypto Briefing, he explained that the company has already expanded into journalism, another public good, having deployed $150,000 so far.

According to Owocki, public health is a logical next step, especially given that the global pandemic is one of the reasons crypto is down in the first place. He added:

“It is lucky for us that the product and brand we’ve built for software engineers scales so nicely into other important categories of public goods. All types of people can GIT COINs, not just engineers. We will of course be humble entering these new categories, but resolute about the amazing power of quadratic funding to create value in new places.”

Gitcoin’s Next Grants Delayed

The new initiative will be part of Gitcoin Grants Round 5, which will also include general Ethereum projects. Currently, 309 tech projects and 58 media projects are listed on Gitcoin Grants.

This round of grants was initially scheduled to begin on Mar. 16. However, on Mar. 12, Gitcoin decided to delay the event’s start date by a week due to market volatility. Bitcoin underwent a massive price crash yesterday, which was reflected in prices all across the cryptocurrency market.

Gitcoin has said very little about its particular concerns, but it is worth noting that it relies heavily on Maker’s Dai stablecoin for payments. Though Dai maintained its dollar peg throughout yesterday’s price drop, Maker is taking emergency measures to ensure future stability.

However, according to the company, they are monitoring the MKR situation closely and at this time they see no reason to caution users against using Dai to donate.

Additionally, Ethereum is experiencing high transaction fees, which may pose another problem for Gitcoin. Right now, the average Ethereum transaction costs $0.76, up from $0.16 on March 11.

Round 5 is now scheduled to start on Mar. 23, at which point these issues may be resolved.

More Support Within Crypto

Gitcoin is not the only blockchain project that is working to combat Coronavirus.

In January, Binance pledged $1.5 million worth of Chinese yuan (RMB) to aid Coronavirus sufferers. It also donated several batches of medical supplies to Wuhan hospitals this month.

On a smaller scale, the Tezos community is offering a reward to any user who can contribute the most computer power to medical research. The prize pool contains 405 XTZ, currently worth $725 USD.

Putting fundraising aside, some upcoming event organizers have decided to support health advisories around isolation and social distancing. Consensus 2020 and Ethereal 2020, two notable blockchain conferences, have both announced plans to move to a virtual venue this year.

With Coronavirus dominating the news cycle, it seems likely that many other cryptocurrency-related projects and companies will express solidarity in the future.","A lot of people have heard about Bitcoin but when they are asked what cryptocurrency is, they seem to have no clue. Simply put, Cryptocurrency just like every other currency, is a form of value exchange. The same way you use your local currency to purchase goods and services, cryptocurrency can also be used to achieve that. The technology that powers cryptocurrency is called Blockchain. This is, a decentralized technology that manages and records transactions.

For the purpose of this article, we will be discussing the 10 things you should know about cryptocurrency before diving in.

1. How is the price of cryptocurrency determined?

There are no regulating bodies to determine the price of cryptocurrency, this makes it easy for the users of the currency to drive the price high or low. How this works is that when a big crypto exchange adopts a particular cryptocurrency, there is a high chance of an increase in value. Also, if a big crypto exchange leaves a particular cryptocurrency, its value will most likely diminish.

2. When is the right time to buy?

This is a very tricky question. Due to the fact that the price change frequently within a short period of time, it is difficult to know the right time to invest in cryptocurrency. As earlier stated, there are no regulatory bodies. Proper research is necessary before you put your money in it.

3. How secure is your cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies are prone to hacker attacks due to their volatility. Holding your crypto in an offline wallet has proven to be the safest way of keeping it. However, you still need to go online to trade the funds. This is why you should use only trusted exchange platforms to trade cryptocurrency. Check some of the best platforms to buy and sell cryptocurrency in Nigeria.

4. Never trade over the public internet

This applies to every financial transaction you carry out over the internet. They are not to be done over the public internet (or public Wi-Fi). This makes it easy for attackers to steal sensitive information like your wallet pin, credit card details and other information useful to carry out fraud by intercepting traffic while you carry out the transaction.

5. Your losses are not insured

In case of any loss during the course of trading, especially from cyber attack, you should know that you are not covered by insurance and you are responsible for it.

6. How many types of cryptocurrency are available?

Presently, there are over 3000 cryptocurrencies available. They all fall in either one of the following categories:

Bitcoin

Altcoin (alternative to Bitcoin)

Token

From these three, the most prevalent is Bitcoin, and that is because it is the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market cap ($176B).

7. Can you revert cryptocurrency transactions?

Unlike other financial transactions, cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reverted. This makes it necessary to double-check each transaction before final authorization.

8. Cryptocurrency risk; low or high?

The risk of investing in cryptocurrency is high. This means if your risk appetite is low, then maybe crypto-investing is not for you. The factor responsible for this is the volatility of the currency.

9. What method of storage is used for cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is stored in what is called a “Digital wallet” with a secured PIN or code. With this wallet, you are able to send, receive, as well as store your cryptocurrency. Offline wallets, as earlier mentioned, are the safest way to keep your cryptocurrency.

10. How do you invest in cryptocurrency?

The first step you need to take is to identify a secure exchange platform, one that guarantees the safety of your cryptocurrency. Another thing to look out for is the charges they take on each successful transaction on their platform, you definitely want to go for the most affordable one.

Once you’ve sorted the above, you can now purchase the cryptocurrency. The platforms allow you to purchase in your local currency and you are allowed to pay through your bank account or credit/debit card.

Are You Crypto-ready?

Cryptocurrency continues to grow as it gains more acceptance. The future looks bright and we hope that these points will help you in making a decision on whether or not to dive into cryptocurrency. Do well to drop any question you have in the comment section.","For more than half-a-decade , the Shire Free Church has been providing a Cryptocurrency Vending Machine (CVM) in Keene as a service to the community. Eventually expanding to a CVM in Manchester and a second one in Keene , we have had the pleasure of connecting countless people with Bitcoin (BTC) at the lowest rates in the region. A few years after launching in Keene we also began offering buyers a choice of other cryptocurrencies besides BTC – DASH and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), the two most-used-at-retail cryptos across New Hampshire.

Now, I’m excited to announce that we’re adding a fourth cryptocurrency to our CVMs located at the Bitcoin Embassy in Keene and Murphy’s Taproom in Manchester – the world’s top privacy coin – Monero!

Started in 2014, Monero (XMR) was immediately different from all of the other “altcoins” competing with the crypto-King-of-the-hill, Bitcoin (BTC). Uniquely at the time, Monero wasn’t a fork of the Bitcoin source code. Monero is instead based on a technology called “Cryptonote”. The Cryptonote white paper describes a major flaw with Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s public ledger, the “blockchain”, allows all Bitcoin transactions to be totally traceable. Despite what some in media and government might claim, Bitcoin is not anonymous and every transaction can be tracked, all the way back to the very first one. Monero’s system solves this problem and introduces true anonymity and fungibility to cryptocurrency – the way it should have been from the start.

Today, there are a myriad of privacy coins out there, but since the supermajority of them were based on Bitcoin, the private features of the other coins are always added on and that means there are still public transaction options in most other privacy coins like Zcash and its variants. With these coins, the user must choose to send a private or public transaction and roughly 90% of Zcash transactions, for instance, are “unshielded”. With Monero there is no choice. All transactions are private.

As you might imagine, the government gang does not like this privacy technology one bit. They want to know everything you do with your money, so they can better control you. One of the best things about Bitcoin was that it allowed for the first time a money system to exist completely outside the control of the state. Cryptocurrency is a true competitor to the multi-generational dominance of the central banks’ fiat currencies like the Dollar. However, Bitcoin and most of its crypto-competition still allow the government gangsters to monitor transactions. Monero fixes that. Once you buy Monero, the trail ends.

The Shire Free Church is an interfaith church with a mission to foster peace. Every dollar of value we can help people convert to cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Monero is value the state can no longer steal to commit violence like going to war across the planet, or going to war against the people – like with their insane War on Drugs. Therefore, offering cryptocurrency in return for a donation to the church is a direct method to increase peace. Connecting the community to crypto also allows people to protect their wealth from the ravages of the state cultists and now with the addition of Monero, allows them to completely obscure how much they have and how it’s spent.

Right now with the recent bloodbath in crypto prices during the Coronavirus downturn, Monero and other cryptos are super cheap compared to where they were just a week ago. You may purchase Monero from our CVMs at your own risk, so long as your intention is to use it for peaceful, legal purposes.

Bitcoin's supply cap is one of its biggest selling points. Limiting the network to almost 21 million BTC, the cap makes Bitcoin a ‘deflationary’ currency.

Naturally, people have been questioning whether it might be possible to remove this cap. In theory, by simply submitting a pull request to Bitcoin Core's GitHub, a hosting service that is most often used for code, repository, a developer could potentially have the cap's removal introduced into a future version of Bitcoin.

But according to Bitcoin developers and other industry players, the likelihood of this happening is very low. Yes, it’s technically feasible, but at least now there's an enormous social consensus against such removal. Even if such a pull request goes through, most likely it would end up with another version of “Bitcoin” while the original cryptocurrency would still have its supply cap.

Bitcoin's philosophy

The most recent debate kicked off with a tweet from Angela Walch, a research fellow at the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies.

@angela_walch If I present a properly formatted constitutional amendment that removes the right of women to vote, w… https://t.co/WDw93pDJOQ — Ari Paul ⛓️ (@AriDavidPaul)

As Walch points out, there are only so many reasons why a pull request to update Bitcoin Core's code can be rejected by an editor. These include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backward compatibility.

However, another cause for rejection is the failure to comply with Bitcoin's philosophy. It's here that Walch's suggestion falls down, since a raised or unlimited supply cap would almost certainly depart from this philosophy, and it would almost certainly confront widespread opposition from Bitcoin developers.

""In order for a pull request to be accepted, it first needs to go through peer review,"" explains Benedict Chan, the chief technical officer for BitGo.

""A change to the supply cap would represent a significant modification to the behavior of the software properties, and would likely generate substantial discussion and pushback ""NACK""s [negative-acknowledgments]. Without clear consensus, no Bitcoin core maintainer would merge it into the code repository.""

But even if Bitcoin developers were to insert the removal of the cap into a new Bitcoin Core version, this doesn't necessarily mean that Bitcoin would have its cap removed.

Ceci n'est pas Bitcoin

""Once the new release is distributed, different stakeholders - users, miners, and various organizations that service the industry (exchanges and wallet providers) must all download and run it,"" says Benedict Chan.

""These stakeholders are incentivized to verify the behavior of the code, understand what they are running, and (hopefully) act in a manner that will be positive for themselves and Bitcoin. They may not see the removal of the supply cap as an improvement, and thus not move forward to run it.""

In other words, even if the developers release a new version of Bitcoin without the supply cap, the people who actually run Bitcoin may refuse to use it.

Guardian Circle CEO/Co-founder Mark Jeffrey agrees.

""If a change of this magnitude WERE to somehow make it through the Bitcoin developer community, there would be a revolt at the miner and exchange level,"" he says. ""I'd expect a major fork to occur, and I would expect the market to largely rally around the fork where the 21m cap was preserved.""

A fork into two separate cryptocurrencies would occur, and this leads CEO and co-founder of Bull Bitcoin, Francis Pouliot, to argue that the forked cryptocurrency without the 21 million supply cap would no longer be Bitcoin.

He tells Cryptonews.com, ""Bitcoin's supply cap cannot be lifted, because whatever shitcoin is airdropped to existing Bitcoin users, even if its promoters call it Bitcoin, will be incompatible with the existing Bitcoin network and therefore would not be Bitcoin.""

The security question

Meanwhile, there is another Bitcoin supply cap-related narrative, popular among the Bitcoin skeptics and in the camp of altcoins and “altchains.”

For example, Emin Gün Sirer, CEO of AVA Labs, the developer of the AVA blockchain, says that an alteration to the 21 million cap might be necessary after three more Bitcoin mining reward halvings due to security reasons.

""As the amount of awards given to the miners dwindles down, the security of the network will drop,” he says, forecasting “massive double-spend attacks targeting exchanges” and suggesting that removing the supply cap would solve this.

However, Bitcoiners say that Sirer is wrong and halving block rewards won’t weaken Bitcoin’s security. Read about it here.","Trending Forced to ‘Work from Home’ due to Covid-19? Crypto Can Help

The CoVid-19 pandemic led to pressures to work from home. Despite the price crash, the crypto economy has some positive examples.

Crypto Startups Already Established Distributed Team Model

For years, the crypto space has operated as a global, interconnected network of opinion leaders and developer teams. Bitcoin (BTC) appeared and spread through a loose forum community, and to this day, no one has met its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, in person. In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and companies forcing their staff to stay indoors, “work from home” searches have suddenly exploded on Google, and remote work hashtags showed that regular business was behind the curve.

Over the years, crypto projects cropped up, tapping developer and marketing talent from across the globe. The crypto space turned out into a big work-from-home operation, where remote teams were the norm, rather than the exception.

Even in a bear market, crypto projects continue to operate, offering opportunities for passive income and community engagement.

Crypto startups have worked on use cases such as time monetization. Other projects already rode the wave, finding solutions for secure file sharing.

Passive Income, Trading, Gaming, and Distributed Finance All Done Remotely

Whether the coronavirus pandemic will lead to more remote work is anyone’s guess. But the culture of distributed teams is gaining experience and technological solutions every day. All the while, BTC and other crypto coins have long ago broken the borders of payments, where banking systems still lack reach or are prohibitively expensive.

But crypto assets are not all about passive income or thinly veiled Ponzi schemes. Developer teams, if they ever worked in an office, were the first ones to be sent home and continue their productivity. For most open-source, distributed crypto projects, even the biggest ones, a remote team is the norm. Ethereum, a project that is instrumental to the crypto space, has been guided by a remote developer team.

Blockchain is also, in itself, a technology for remote consensus and record-keeping. Added to the open-source ethos, the crypto space has given an example of how the knowledge economy can continue to work remotely.

Exchanges are also showing a model of working at all times, with a distributed team. The recent crypto crash was partly due to the fact that trading and transactions don’t have any time limits, and are open 24/7. Trading is also possible to anyone, and although risky, has created trading opportunities despite geography. Even after the market slide, most exchanges mark significant activity.

2020-03-15,"On Feb. 26, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the rejection of yet another ETF submission from Wilshire Phoenix, a New York-based investment firm, citing a lack of resistance to market manipulation and fraudulent activity. The filing stated that the NYSE Arca had not demonstrated that the market was “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.”

While Wilshire Phoenix aimed to base its ETF both on Bitcoin (BTC) and the United States Treasury bonds to hedge against Bitcoin's volatility in a hope to break the trend of ETF rejections, the reasons cited by the SEC remain the same: a lack of a surveillance-sharing agreement with a significant market for the underlying asset or a novel demonstration of the market’s inherent resistance to manipulation.

While reactions were mixed even within the commission itself, the decision highlights the need for a more robust and transparent exchange ecosystem. It also highlights the importance of data and its interpretation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. This was one of the topics discussed at the CryptoCompare Digital Asset Summit, hosted in London on March 10, which Cointelegraph attended. The panel focused on data and analysis, and how these two could help bring much transparency to the space and pave the way to institutionalization and regulatory improvement.

Main issues in the Bitcoin exchange ecosystem

The cryptocurrency scene has been, for a long time, regarded as a lawless land, or the “Wild West” of finance. The lack of clear regulatory guidelines and oversight has allowed companies to engage in less than savory tactics to gain market share. This has also been aided by the absence of easy-to-digest information in the crypto space, making it possible for retail investors to be misled by malicious companies.

Crypto exchanges have often relied on volume manipulation in order to boost their visibility and position in the industry. While this has been done in part to attract traders to the platforms — as they often look at volume to understand how liquid an exchange is and how much impact their trades will have on the market — exchanges also use these tactics to attract projects looking to list themselves.

Fundamentally, not only does this hurt users and the projects that are listed on these platforms but it also develops a bad reputation for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Institutional investors will stay away from unregulated markets especially when manipulation is rampant. Indeed, this has caused some regulators to crack down aggressively on exchanges as, for example, in 2017, the People’s Bank of China’s actions saw China’s volumes decrease from the absolute majority (>90%) to only a fraction of the global trades.

Transparency, when it comes to volumes, is not the only issue found on exchanges. Fractional reserve practices have also been a problem. The infamous Mt.Gox fiasco that led users to lose 850,000 BTC collectively — valued at around $460 million at the time — also demonstrated the need for more transparency when it comes to solvency. Poor security has also been a weak point in the cryptosphere, as many of the top-tier exchanges have been hacked in the past.

While exchanges have been at the heart of some of the biggest issues in crypto, the 2017 initial coin offering craze, along with their resulting losses, also demonstrated a lack of accountability and transparency from projects and token issuers, and they’ve led the U.S. SEC to issue a crackdown on these activities, having filed lawsuits against multiple ICOs.

Volume manipulation, techniques and challenges

According to the panel, fake volume is certainly a common concern in the market but one that will most likely fade away as transparency grows and incentives for faking volume disappear. James Kim, co-founder of CrossAngle, a disclosure platform, said: “In the long run, faking volume is not going to be competitive, either for exchanges or investors.”

Efforts to bring transparency to the market are aided by the inherent public nature of blockchain technology. For example, Flipside Crypto, a research and intelligence firm, looks at on-chain data to analyze the inflow of Bitcoin onto exchanges and match it to the reported trading volumes to detect suspicious activity. Avi Meyers, director of business development of Flipside Crypto, stated:

“[Faking volume] is certainly going to damage the integrity of some of the exchanges, so, obviously, that’s why we’re focusing on it now because we want to increase legitimacy of these trading venues so we can drive institutional investment.”

Chainalysis uses a similar approach to identify fake volume. In a study published last year, the crypto forensics firm looked at 10 exchanges from the top tier and came up with a baseline ratio for reading volume when looking at incoming BTC and BTC being traded. Based on this metric, they found many discrepancies when looking at other exchanges. Although this ratio can serve as a baseline, analyzing the data requires some level of insight on different types of exchanges. Philip Gradwell, chief economist of Chainalysis, explained:

“Some exchanges are largely custodians so they get much more Bitcoin flowing into the exchange relative to the amount of trading they have and then you have some exchanges where people are happy to just leave their crypto on that exchange and just trade all day and so they have a much higher ratio.”

On the other hand, crypto market data provider CryptoCompare looked at off-chain data to determine how exchanges potentially fake volume while also analyzing their order books and other data points to assess reported volume.

Once again, these datasets are not always easy to interpret and are subject to the nuances of the cryptocurrency world. This is the case with novelty venues like zero-fee or transaction-fee mining exchanges. The monthly exchange report published by CryptoCompare in October 2019 demonstrated how these nuances make crypto hard to navigate for those who do not actively follow the space. It reads:

“This [zero-fee or transaction-fee mining trading] might give traders an incentive to trade more to receive more tokens which often have valuable features such as voting rights on the platform or a dividend. Both of the above can effectively lead to wash trading.”

Quality vs. quantity, bringing transparency and trust into crypto

While volume and market capitalization have been, for the most part, the main metric that stakeholders have worried about, new ways of categorizing projects and exchanges are being created to give market participants a better understanding of the ecosystem.

These efforts to find new metrics to evaluate projects include CryptoCompare’s Exchange Benchmark — which ranks exchanges from AA to F based on qualitative data like due diligence and quantitative measures like “market quality based on order book and trade data.”

FlipSide’s Fundamental Crypto Asset Score looks at on-chain and off-chain data to analyze various factors — like “User Activity,” “Developer Behavior” and “Market Maturity” — to rate assets from 0–1,000, and to assign a ranking score from “Superb” to “Fragile,” focusing largely on the first two points rather than the market itself, as the latter only contributes to 5% of the overall score.

Crossangle’s product, Xangle, provides a disclosure and governance system for crypto markets, bringing it up to traditional financial standards like the ones applied in the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval database. Xangle facilitates corporate filings and makes these readily available to the public.

These initiatives, and others like it, create a basis for serious investors to choose trading venues and assets and incentivize exchanges to report volumes accurately, focusing on improving ease of use, security and regulatory compliance. However, there are still some ways to go about this, and in many cases, the methodology may be a work in progress as Jenna Wright, head of LMAX Digital, an institutional spot cryptocurrency exchange and part of the LMAX Group, told Cointelegraph, adding:

“We think that industry players, especially research companies, need to ensure that their research and benchmarking methodologies capture an accurate picture of the market. This means that the methodology, used to measure volumes and market share, needs to be consistent across providers and must ensure it captures the different players in order to offer an accurate picture of the market.”

Data and regulation, a bottoms-up approach

Crypto is a completely new and uncharted territory that opens up a lot of questions for regulators and institutional investors — the latter of whom relies heavily on the former when considering investing in the space. This is another area where data companies are becoming essential as cryptocurrencies are largely misinterpreted by regulatory entities. Kim stated during the panel:

“I think most of the players are expecting governments to come up with clear guidelines to say it’s okay to trade, how to trade, it’s okay to do business in the crypto world, but more likely, I think it will happen the other way around. Governments are not experts, they’re asking the regional players and players who can provide research, who have seen responses from the market and investors to understand what’s happening.”

Data companies and some exchanges have been working with regulators to help them understand digital assets and their associated infrastructure. Chainalysis is known for working with agencies that fight crime to track illegal activity and money laundering. Flipside Crypto uses blockchain data to map wallets to foundations and bring transparency about what entities hold what assets.

CryptoCompare provides data services to a number of regulators, according to James Harris — another member of the panel — and has also publicly launched the Cryptoasset Taxonomy Report, which offers “a framework to help retail and institutional investors, regulators and the industry as a whole gain a holistic understanding of the crypto asset landscape.”

While some countries have outright banned crypto or taken other aggressive measures against it, others are working actively to understand and regulate it. When asked about it, the panel unanimously named the U.S. as the most advanced and forward-thinking country when it comes to crypto regulation, also citing other countries like Singapore, the United Kingdom and Germany.

The road to institutionalization

A previous SEC filing regarding the rejection of the Bats BZX Exchange ETF cited a lack of data over Bitcoin’s spot market resistance to manipulation due to arbitrage opportunities.

However, data and transparency, especially when it comes to exchanges, could hold the key for the regulatory approval of a Bitcoin-based ETF which, in turn, can be the start of an institutional-level cashflow into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Gradwell said:

“If you want to get serious money into crypto, you have got to build up their confidence that there are actually good trading venues […] If you’re an exchange and you have good incentives to report real volume, you may actually get institutional money coming in, but if you don’t have those incentives, they’ll stay away.”

Initiatives like the aforementioned ones bring much-needed transparency to the market and allow institutions to access and understand large datasets from the cryptocurrency market — which is quintessential to driving institutional investment. Initiatives by trading venues like Proof of Reserves will also be a driving force despite carrying some security and practicality challenges.

While it’s still unclear how long regulators and institutional investors will take to jump on board the crypto bandwagon, the future looks bright. Institutional demand for regulated trading products seems to exist as signaled by the creation of Bitcoin exchange traded products and blockchain ETFs, and as the crypto world starts to become more aligned with traditional finance standards, this demand will be allowed to grow and to finally materialize into actual market participation. Nevertheless, there is still work to be done as noted by Wright: “The cryptocurrency industry has already gone a long way in disclosing volume data, but there is still a way to go.”","Coming every Sunday, Hodler’s Digest will help you track every single important news story that happened this week.

Whenever there’s a big crash on the stock market, traders on Wall Street are often pictured with their heads in their hands — surrounded by a sea of screens with red numbers. This week, it was crypto’s turn. Bitcoin prices had been relatively stable in the high $7,000s at the start of the week… then Thursday happened. BTC dramatically fell by 17% in the space of an hour — taking it below $6,000 for the first time since May 2019. Hours later, BTC was under $5,000. But the sell-offs were far from over. Later that evening, BTC slumped to $3,637 only to rebound above $5,200 within minutes. The meltdown means that, at the time of writing, Bitcoin is down 33% compared to where it was last Sunday. Analysis from Keith Wareing suggests there are reasons to be optimistic: True hodlers are unfazed, newcomers can enter the market at lower prices, and catastrophic sell-offs are now much less likely. The carnage also means the number of people owning 1 BTC has hit a new record. More than $50 billion has been wiped off Bitcoin’s market cap over the past seven days. Uncertainty surrounding the ever-worsening coronavirus pandemic means we could end up waiting a while for a bounceback.

Of course, Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency that’s been having a bad week. Thursday also saw ETH prices take a beating — and this was especially problematic for the decentralized finance community. MakerDAO briefly explored the prospect of an emergency shutdown after the crash left millions of dollars in debt under-collateralized. Voting is now underway to determine how the lending protocol should tackle this crisis. Despite the “perfect storm,” many executives in the DeFi community remain confident in the ecosystem. Some believe that harsh lessons will be learned as a result of the crash, with InstaDApp CEO Sowmay Jain saying: “Such painful times remind us that we are extremely early in the space, and there’s still lots of room for improvement.”

Earlier in March, a controversial ban that stopped banks from offering services to crypto-related firms was overturned by India’s Supreme Court. If you thought this would be the end of it, you were badly mistaken. This week, lawyers claimed that certain financial institutions are still arbitrarily denying to process crypto-related transactions. It seems these domestic banks are waiting for further confirmation from the Reserve Bank of India — which instigated the ban in the first place and is planning to appeal the ruling. It’s also possible that the country’s parliament will revisit a proposed law that would see anyone caught dealing in cryptocurrencies will face up to 10 years in prison. Sadly, it doesn’t seem like there is going to be a happy ending for India’s crypto community anytime soon.

BNP Paribas is apparently blocking customers from sending funds to Coinbase, a major crypto exchange. The French banking giant’s restrictions seem to have come into force over the past week — and transfers to other crypto trading platforms appear to be taking place as usual. A source told Cointelegraph that Coinbase is considered an “illegal operation,” and the restrictions look like they were imposed with very little notice. Fraud, malware, scams and the anonymous coin Monero were among the factors that led to the decision.

In a week of doom and gloom, it’s worth ending our news roundup on a high note. A former Bitcoin miner has stumbled upon an old wallet that contained 1,000 Bitcoins, which also included myriad forks. It’s believed that the BTC was mined a long time ago, and the wallet.dat file was recently found on a USB stick. The lucky miner, identified on Reddit as “whoamisoon,” had turned to Reddit on Tuesday for advice on how the coins could be moved onto an exchange — and later that day, 1,000 BTC appeared to be making their way to Coinbase. A post on Thursday suggested that whoamisoon managed to liquidate everything before prices crashed. Whoamisoon wrote: “Thank you all for all the suggestions. It was overall a great return and the best welcome one can get!”

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $5,342.51, Ether at $125.01 and XRP at $0.15. The total market cap is at $153,190,529,804.

Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Multi-collateral DAI, USD Coin and Paxos Standard. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Matic Network, Maker and Algorand.

Most Memorable Quotations

“The MakerDAO had a +$500K surplus before the price drop and now has a -$4M surplus that needs to be filled.” MakerDAO

“We are in the middle of a revolution in payments. Banknotes — the bank’s most accessible form of money — are being used less frequently to make payments.” Bank of England

“If I interpret the chart without bias, I would say sub $1,000.” Peter Brandt, veteran trader

“Insane theory of the day: There was no BitMEX hardware issue.” Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda CEO

“Banks’ refusal to provide services for the sale/purchase of crypto assets is absolutely illegal, unjust and arbitrary in the eyes of the law and the same amounts to wilful disobedience to the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court.” Mohammed Danish, fintech lawyer

“This is the first time in a while I’ve felt like buying bitcoin. That drop was too much panic and too little reason.” Edward Snowden

Prediction of the Week

In the aftermath of Bitcoin crashing below $4,000, one experienced market analyst had an alarming prediction that the worst may be yet to come. Peter Brandt — who is famous for correctly predicting the market crash from the all-time high — said the new bottom is potentially “sub-$1,000” if he interprets BTC charts without bias. That would be a fall of more than 80% from their current level. Brandt is no crypto skeptic, and he often makes predictions that are more bullish than bearish. In the past, he’s suggested that parabolic increases in BTC charts could see it hit $140,000. His latest analysis will be something that many in the crypto world don’t want to hear.

FUD of the Week

A judge has attacked Craig Wright for producing forged documents and giving a perjured testimony. The self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto has been fighting a ruling that is forcing him to hand over more than 500,000 BTC to the family of Dave Kleiman, his late business partner. Judge Bruce Reinhart has questioned Wright’s credibility and said during a hearing: “I give no weight to sworn statements of Dr. Wright that advance his interests but that have not been challenged by cross-examination and for which I cannot make a credibility determination. I have previously found that Dr. Wright gave perjured testimony in my presence.” Wright is under pressure to provide documentation detailing how many Bitcoins are held by the so-called “Tulip Trust.”

The crypto crash was bad news for BitMEX. During frenzied trading activity as prices fell off a cliff, the exchange faced unexpected downtime. This sparked rumors of foul play, with BitMEX officials rejecting the allegations as a “conspiracy theory.” The outage meant the company’s services suffered disruption between 2:16 a.m. and 2:40 a.m. UTC on Friday — minutes after BTC prices had suddenly tanked below $4,000. BitMEX says a “hardware issue with our cloud service provider” was the reason requests were delayed.

A blockchain forensics firm has published a detailed analysis of how two Chinese nationals linked to North Korea laundered stolen cryptocurrency worth tens of millions of dollars. According to CipherTrace’s findings, the pair are believed to be associated with the Lazarus Group — cybercriminals who were responsible for 2014’s Sony breach and 2017’s WannaCry ransomware epidemic. The United States Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has added Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong to its list of sanctioned individuals. It is believed “peel chains” were used to obfuscate the size of funds being deposited to any given wallet.

One particular platform, coronavirusapp[.]site, is prompting users to install an Android application for real-time updates on the pandemic. Instead, the app comes bundled with a ransomware aptly called “CovidLock”.

CovidLock asks for permission to access the lock screen. It then employs a technique known as screen-lock attack, which holds the phone hostage by blocking user access.

The ransomware threatens to erase contacts, pictures and videos on the infected device, as well as leak the victim’s social media account information and wipe all phone data unless a ransom of $100 is paid in Bitcoin within 48 hours.

Saleh says phones running on the latest Android versions should be fine if the user set a password to unlock the screen.

“Since Android Nougat has rolled out, there is protection in place against this type of attack. However, it only works if you have set a password. If you haven’t set a password on your phone to unlock the screen, you’re still vulnerable to the CovidLock ransomware.”

DomainTools researchers say they’ve already reverse-engineered the decryption key and plan to share it publicly. They are also monitoring the transactions in the Bitcoin wallet used by the ransomware.

While the various country markets and stock exchanges have witnessed a historic drop in their indices, Bitcoin too could not escape the effect of Covid-19. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, this week, recorded a plunge by over 50%, even as private cryptocurrency projects Libra and Celo announced new plans.

Trading at $9.1K on March 7, Bitcoin had hit $4.1K on March 12, registering a free fall of over 48% within 24 hours, and is currently priced at $5.6K, according to data produced by Coinmarketcap.

Despite the Bitcoin halving being just 55 days away and some positive news from India, the drop in price has surprised investors. Could it be due to coronavirus pandemic or Plus token scam which moved another 13K Bitcoin worth $118 Mn? Experts have mixed views.

Some of the crypto enthusiasts have now demanded that crypto exchanges come up with marketwide circuit breaker, a panacea which helps save stock exchanges on bad days. However, former NSA analyst and whistleblower Edward Snowden saw this as an opportunity to buy Bitcoin. Snowden tweeted,

Is Celo The New Libra?

While Facebook’s much-hyped Libra cryptocurrency has been mired in huge controversies prompting a slew of countries to announce plans to ban it even before launch, and some members of Libra Association exiting the group, another similar alliance has seen 50 major organisations joining hands. The Libra rival project is called Celo and the Celo Alliance has announced its own blockchain and cryptocurrency.

In its statement, Celo Alliance stated, “The goal of the alliance is to bring organizations together to help with the shared vision of making digital assets more accessible and useful in the real world. Today, less than 0.5% of global citizens benefit from the speed, transparency, utility, and low cost of using blockchain technology. The alliance members have a plan to change that and are committed to leveraging the power of Celo’s innovative blockchain technology to create solutions that work across devices, carriers, & countries.”

On use-cases and focus areas, the Alliance members are pursuing a powering mobile and online work, remittances, humanitarian aid, payments, and microlending. Their combined reach is said to be over 400 Mn people. For example, humanitarian aid organizations will use Celo Dollars instead of distributing food or fiat in order to reduce the cost of sending perishable items or prepaid cards. “We saw some of these challenges firsthand last year with our research in Nyarugusu, a Tanzanian refugee camp, and are excited about the potential use of Celo Dollars as a more effective alternative.”

Facebook Plans To Revamp Libra

Changing its stance from creating a single global digital currency under Libra cryptocurrency project, the social media giant Facebook and other founding partners are now mulling a redesign in order to create space for multiple coins. The members are considering increased acceptance for other coins including fiat currencies.

According to Bloomberg, the association will re-introduce Libra soon, but the redesign is in flux and the plan could change. The dream of a single global coin isn’t dead, said one source. The new plan could expand on the original vision and is unlikely to be a retreat.

Belgium To Auction $125K Worth Seized Crypto

After the US Marshals Service, a federal law enforcement agency with the Department of Justice held an auction for approximately 4,041 Bitcoins, the Belgian government has announced plans to auction multiple digital currencies including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Gold.

While the online auction will commence on March 24, Wilsons Auctions, an Ireland-based auction house will initiate the selling of these cryptocurrencies on behalf of the Belgian government. To attract retail buyers, the auction house will split Bitcoins across lots ranging from 0.25 to 1 Bitcoin, while other cryptocurrency lots will have a higher number of tokens, according to reports.","US State Wants to Legally Seize Unclaimed Cryptocurrencies Left at Custodians

The U.S. state of Illinois has advanced a bill to consider unclaimed cryptocurrencies at custodians abandoned after five years. The coins will then be liquidated and the proceeds remitted to the State Treasurer. The cryptocurrency owners will have no recourse against the custodians or the state.

Crypto Considered Abandoned if Unclaimed for 5 Years

Illinois House Bill 4573, which amends the state’s Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, was assigned to the state’s Revenue and Finance Committee on Thursday. As if to demonstrate the oft-cited bitcoin maxim “not your keys, not your coins,” the bill introduced by Rep. Michael J. Zalewski states:

[The bill] Provides that virtual currency is presumed abandoned if it is unclaimed by the apparent owner 5 years after the last indication of interest in the property.

The term “virtual currency” is defined in the bill as “any type of digital unit, including cryptocurrency.” A holder “means a person obligated to hold for the account of, or to deliver or pay to, the owner, property subject to this Act” and the term “Apparent owner” means “a person whose name appears on the records of a holder as the owner of property held, issued, or owing by the holder.”

Forced Liquidation

The bill additionally “Provides for the delivery of reportable virtual currency to the State Treasurer,” according to its text. Referring to the State Treasurer as the administrator, the bill proposes:

If property reported to the administrator is virtual currency, the holder shall liquidate the virtual currency and remit the proceeds to the administrator. The liquidation shall occur anytime within 30 days prior to the filing of the report under Section 15-401.

“The owner shall not have recourse against the holder or the administrator to recover any gain in value that occurs after the liquidation of the virtual currency under this subsection,” the bill continues.

Illinois Money Transmitter Licenses for Crypto Companies

Cryptocurrency exchange service providers operating in the state of Illinois may need to obtain a money transmitter license under the Illinois Transmitters of Money Act (TOMA). Early this month, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, Division of Financial Institutions, clarified its position in non-binding statements regarding money transmitter licenses for crypto firms. Its letter to San Diego-based The Crypto Lawyers regarding whether a crypto firm called Cryptoflip was required to obtain a TOMA license explains that “Cryptoflip is not selling or issuing payment instruments because payment instruments must be ‘for the transmission or payment of money,'” adding:

Bitcoin is not money under TOMA.

Cryptoflip claims that it will sell bitcoin from its own supply, will not post orders on third party exchanges, or receive funds for transmission. Since the company is not acting as a third-party exchange or an “escrow-like intermediary,” it is therefore not in the business of receiving money for transmission or transmitting money. Furthermore, Cryptoflip is not engaged in the business of exchanging fiat currency for fiat currency and will only work with TOMA-licensed companies that are also registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as Money Services Businesses. Based on the information presented, the Department concluded that Cryptoflip would not require a TOMA license, elaborating:

Each exchange is an exchange of digital currency for money between Cryptoflip and a consumer … Cryptoflip is not engaged in money transmission when it sells its own cryptocurrency for fiat currency.

On the federal level, Rep. Paul Gosar introduced the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 last week while under self-quarantine. The aim of this bill is to “clarify which federal agencies regulate digital assets, to require those agencies to notify the public of any federal licenses, certifications, or registrations required to create or trade in such assets, and for other purposes.”

Events like the global coronavirus outbreak provide good justification for some prepping. Crises like this often result in shortages and skyrocketing prices of important emergency items, proving that everyone should keep a box of face masks and even a decent survival kit, should things go really bad. The pandemic scare affected crypto holders this week leading to a massive sell-off. But even in these circumstances, there are more rational ways to part with your coins instead of a panic sell.

How to Buy Anti-Virus Masks With Bitcoin

Avoiding crowded stores is a good idea right now. Luckily, there are many web-based merchants that will sell you just about everything you could need in a doomsday scenario or a survival situation. You can still procure online most of what the Red Cross thinks you should have in your survival kit in the event of an emergency or disaster, such as a flashlight with extra batteries, a hand-crank radio, a multi-purpose tool, and a first aid box.

In the midst of a viral epidemic, however, priorities are changing. Since COVID-19 started spreading around the world, items essential for preventing infection such as surgical masks have become harder to find and expensive to buy. Reusable masks are even pricier but they provide an alternative solution. Greenbelt Outdoors is an online marketplace for adventure and outdoor equipment that has set out to help its customers in that regard. Its website states:

Our current focus is sourcing N95 masks and respirators where we can for potential protection against the coronavirus (COVID-19). We are working with suppliers for preparation for ‘SHTF’ potential scenarios.

The company behind Greenbelt Outdoors, a veteran-owned business based in Austin, Texas, accepts BTC, BCH, ETH, and XRP through Bitpay, and supports many fiat options including credit cards and Paypal. They currently ship several makes of non-disposable masks with activated carbon filters and washable masks that provide respiratory protection. They are offered at discounted prices. That’s on top of a selection of survival gear you might want to check out, just in case. “The way we see it, it’s more important to be prepared then not at all,” the store notes.

Getting Ready for a SHTF Scenario

You can also get prepared for a worst-case scenario using the services of other platforms that accept cryptocurrency payments. Survival Camping Store is one such example as its website is a rich source not only for camping and backpacking equipment but also a wide range of items for emergency situations. These include survival tools, shelter, bedding and cooking products as well as some self-defense means and hunting weapons — and even medical and hygiene supplies. Survival Camping Store supports multiple traditional payment methods, including major credit cards and Paypal, but you can also pay with cryptocurrency and the store offers a 5% discount for direct crypto payments.

Another option is to check platforms such as Spendabit which functions as a search engine for products that can be purchased with bitcoin. You can use filters to specify the region and the merchants you are interested in or enter keywords. Searching for survival kit and medical gloves returns dozens of offerings coming from stores that supposedly accept cryptocurrency. A nice feature allows you to shortlist those that currently offer discounts of 10% or more. You can also search for merchants processing crypto payments using platforms like Spendbitcoins and Acceptbitcoin.cash.

The Bitcoin.com Store can help you to obtain similar products – if you go to the Gift Cards page you’ll find a wide choice of gift cards for major retailers and service providers that you can buy with either bitcoin core (BTC) or bitcoin cash (BCH). They are sorted in multiple categories like Sports & Outdoors where you can order a card for the popular outdoor gear store Cabela’s. And in the Health category, you’ll be able to purchase a gift card for the CVS pharmacy chain.

The announcement was made during the Blockchain Africa Conference, which is being held in Johannesburg.

Zhao said that South African crypto traders will soon have the option to make Rand deposits on the platform via Binance’s official website. These new services are part of Binance’s ongoing global expansion plans.

Zhao stated:

“Africa illustrates one of the largest demands and instrumental use cases for cryptocurrency, notably for financial access. According to the World Bank, approximately 66 percent of sub-saharan Africans are listed as unbanked. So instead of trying to bank the unbanked, let’s try and Bitcoin the un-Bitcoined.”

Binance is reportedly offering its services in 35 African nations. Zhao pointed out that South Africa was one of the larger countries that the exchange would be serving.

He remarked:

“Looking at South African specifically, crypto adoption continues to rise with SA being one of the top five countries in terms of cryptocurrency ownership. Today I’m excited to announce that Binance is launching a South African fiat-to-crypto gateway soon. This will enable South Africans to buy cryptocurrencies with their local bank accounts.”

Tanya Knowles, Binance’s South Africa country manager, noted that many South African residents are benefiting from the freedom of information and movement, however, they do not yet have freedom of money.

Binance presently supports crypto trading in 180 countries and processes millions of transactions. The value of the exchange’s global digital currency transactions is estimated to be about $4 billion per day, according to data from Coin360.

South Africans will soon have the option to trade in the following pairs: BTC/ZAR, Binance Coin (BNB)/ZAR, Ethereum (ETH)/ZAR, Tether (USDT)/ZAR and Binance USD (BUSD)/ZAR.

Knowles confirmed that the Binance Charity Foundation will donate $1 million in order to support the development of blockchain-focused education initiatives in South Africa.

The organization aims to work with local firms to provide educational programs to drive or promote the growth of the crypto sector in the country.","Traders Flock to Tether, USDC, PAX - Stablecoins See Great Demand After Crypto Market Havoc

Stablecoins have seen massive volume and growth this month especially after the market carnage on March 12. Per usual, tether has been the king of stablecoins following the market downturn, but the 4.6 billion USDT wasn’t enough for all the liquidity needed to shield the storm. Other tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar like USDC, TUSD, and PAX have reaped the benefits as well and a few of them have joined the top trading pairs with BTC.

Stablecoins See Increased Demand and Growth After Crypto Market Wrath

It’s a well known fact that lots of traders like stablecoins and they become useful hedges for people when crypto market prices suddenly dive. Despite a number of people not liking them and the controversies surrounding stablecoins, they have continued to grow very popular during the last few years. Tether (USDT) is the most used stablecoin and the token’s market capitalization is the largest to-date. In fact, USDT is usually the top trading pair with BTC and during the last week, the token captured between 60-75% of BTC trades.

At the time of writing, USDT has a market valuation of around $4.63 billion. Coinmarketcap.com (CMC) data shows reported traded volume for tether is $40.6 billion but messari.io’s “real volume” statistics claim its only $1 billion. Either way, statistical aggregation sites like CMC, markets.Bitcoin.com (6.4B), and messari.io both show that USDT has the most trade volume on March 15 out of 5,000+ coins.

Even though tethers have and still are capturing 60-75% of BTC trades during the last few days, other stablecoins have seen growth from the crypto price downturn as well. Cryptocompare.com stats show that stablecoins like USDC and PAX have been top five trading pairs with BTC. USDC is capturing 4.1% of BTC trades and PAX has around 3% according to cryptocompare.com data.

Usually, these stablecoins are not even close to making it into the top pair trading positions with BTC. On March 14, Circle cofounder Jeremy Allaire explained how USDC saw growth over the last couple of days. “USDC surging in market demand over the past days, reaching new ATH at $568M in circulation,” Allaire tweeted. “Fascinating to see ‘flight to safety’ within the crypto macro market, but also demand for high-quality USD liquidity for markets.” Allaire continued:

While not as exciting to see markets so crushed, it’s still rewarding to see that this entirely new, entirely digital, blockchain-based monetary infrastructure is working.

Stablecoin Arbitrage and Liquidity

While Allaire discussed the situation after the wrath on March 12, Paxos Global’s official Twitter account also tweeted about the various stablecoins they offer custody for and noted that the combined projects had a market capitalization of “more than $395 million as of March 12, 2020.” The stablecoin TUSD has also seen an uptick in volume and the approximate total value of TUSD’s market cap at press time is $132 million.

Paxos is a Trust company, meaning we are a qualified custodian for USD-backed #stablecoins. We power $PAX @PaxosStandard, $HUSD @Stablecoin_HUSD and $BUSD @binance Dollar, with a total market cap of more than $395 million as of March 12, 2020. https://t.co/ZWpJ2LUNkw — Paxos (@PaxosGlobal) March 12, 2020

News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on the incident that took place with the Makerdao defi project after ETH prices dropped more than 40% on Thursday. At that time $4-4.5 million worth of Makerdao’s stablecoin DAI were undercollateralized. However, since then single collateral DAI tokens have been doing much better and on March 15 they are priced at $1.06 per token.

Even though most of the stablecoins are supposed to remain valued at one U.S. dollar after March 12, liquidity demand made prices fluctuate for all of the stablecoins in existence. At times prices have been a touch higher and sometimes stablecoin prices have been a hair lower than the USD peg. Crypto traders have found ways to leverage the current stablecoin arbitrage, which allows them to sell the tokens for higher profits using different markets. Traders have been using stablecoins for arbitrage for years and there are various blog posts and guides on the subject.

It’s likely that traders will continue to use stablecoins and ‘tether off’ in order to hedge the current storm. On Sunday, March 15, cryptocurrency markets have been lackluster and there haven’t been any huge moves. If coins like BCH, ETH, BTC, and many others see improved prices and gains soon then it’s likely traders will gradually exit their stablecoin hedge. However, if markets fall lower in the near future the ‘flight to safety’ within the cryptoconomy might be put to the test with significant stress. If crypto prices drop further liquidity issues could make dollarized tokens worth a lot more than the 5-10 cents higher we’re seeing today.

2020-03-16,"Bitcoin prices have been on a roller-coaster ride since Sunday afternoon after the Federal Reserve slashed rates a full percentage point to the vicinity of 0 percent and promised to pump $700 billion into the U.S. economy. After initially rising on the news and then falling, the cryptocurrency’s buying volumes have picked up.

It’s been an active 24 hours.

The central bank’s drastic measures, taken to offset possible effects of the coronavirus on the U.S. and global economy, included its fourth trip to the quantitative easing (QE) well. However, this action of buying Treasuries and mortgage debt spooked an already nervous stock market, prompting major sell-offs in equity markets all over the world.

Trading in futures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were briefly halted Sunday evening when their decline triggered circuit breakers. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index also had more sellers than buyers.

Meanwhile, bitcoin’s (BTC) reaction showed its traders didn’t know how to take the news. The cryptocurrency initially soared about 8 percent in the hour after Sunday’s emergency meeting and announcement. Then the world’s leading cryptocurrency continued higher, trading as high as $5,990 that night on exchanges including Coinbase. Yet, the rally was short. By Monday morning, bitcoin came close to sinking below $4,500 on some exchanges.

Since bitcoin’s drop, buying volumes have picked up, and it changed hands around $5,069 as of 18:00 UTC (2 p.m. ET), down 4 percent in the past 24 hours.

The S&P 500 was also down as of 18:00 UTC, off by 9 percent after automatic trading curbs went into effect. It’s a stark change from the rally that took place in the last hour of trading before the U.S. markets’ close on March 13 when President Trump declared a state of emergency on the coronavirus.

For a brief period, gold lost its shine as traders hit the sell button on the yellow metal at around 10:00 UTC on Monday, but bullion recovered just as bitcoin was selling off.

“Gold is finding footing today so I’m turning pretty bullish short term,” said Jack Tan of Kronos Research, a Taipei, Taiwan-based trading firm.

After hovering in the $4,600 to $5,900 range for much of the March 14 weekend prior to the Fed news, traders are now looking at that $5,000 area again as a place to buy bitcoin

“Seems like bitcoin is finding support around the $5,000 level. I have purchased around these levels,” added Tan.

A $5,000 price level for bitcoin brings with it some doubt for cryptocurrency miners. That’s because it creates greater uncertainty about mining farms’ profitability. However, Denis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant, thinks the mining industry, a linchpin in securing the Bitcoin network, remains strong.

“While (uncertainty) may be true for smaller farms, the mining ecosystem as a whole remains strong and as secure as ever. More so, apart from anecdotal evidence, there are yet to be any concrete signs of a slump in the hashrate dedicated to mining bitcoin,” Vinokourov noted.",These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,"As institutions unload bitcoin (BTC) along with stocks as part of the coronavirus-driven global sell-off, cryptocurrency’s traditional base – retail investors – is doing most of the buying, market participants said.

And while pricing screens may still be flashing red, business is brisk at many trading platforms.

“We’ve already done more volume in March than all cumulative volume previously,” said River Financial CEO Alex Leishman, head of a bitcoin-centric brokerage in San Francisco that launched three months ago. “About 20 percent of all of our clients have signed up this month. … We’re seeing record interest from first-time bitcoin buyers.”

River Financial is relatively small, with just under 10,000 active user accounts, but this volume surge appears to be rippling across markets. Gemini’s head of communications, Carolyn Vadino, confirmed the New York-based crypto exchange saw a surge in activity over the weekend.

“During this time of market uncertainty, we continue to expect to see higher volumes than normal,” Vadino said.

Likewise, one over-the-counter (OTC) trader in Latin America, who provides liquidity to several of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, said his desk has seen “two to three times” the normal buy orders since the price dropped dramatically on Thursday.

“You still have a lot of people who are long that are trying to get out,” said the trader, who did not want to be named. “It’s more related to hedge funds liquidating than anything else. … There’s a lot of bitcoin-collateralized dollar loans out there to miners or people who are long crypto.”

Imbalance

Another U.S.-based OTC trader confirmed that companies with heavily leveraged loans played into the wave of institutional investors selling off. Yet, retail traders are buying up bitcoin so aggressively that it’s throwing the whole market off, according to the anonymous trader in Latin America.

“I hope this doesn’t stay so long because it could be damaging. We all need some type of volume to survive,” he said.

In short, if more people are buying than selling, trading or leveraging it will be tricky for liquidity providers like himself to profit from arbitrage. This would pressure exchanges to find new market makers, or force market makers themselves to try different strategies. No one quite knows how that would play out if it happens over several months.

“It’s basically half the volume that was trading [when bitcoin was priced] at $9,000, even if it’s the same amount of bitcoin changing hands,” he said.

Volatility

Exchanges like BitMex were briefly overloaded during a period of dramatic volatility last week, experiencing an hour-long outage. According to the analytics firm Skew, BitMex and OKEx alone facilitated nearly $10 billion in bitcoin futures trades on Thursday, March 12.

However, OKEx Financial Markets Director Lennix Lai said it doesn’t make sense for any significant exchange to implement a “circuit breaker,” which automatically halts trading on their platform if rapidly falling prices cripple the system.

“If one major exchange has a circuit breaker while the others keep on trading, the sell-off pressure would simply transfer to another exchange,” Lai said.

As such, smaller brokerages like Leishman’s are focused on preparing their back-end selling mechanisms for unprecedented traffic.

“You can’t choose when volatility hits and the orders start coming in,” Leishman said. “Almost all of our orders have been buy orders. … We need to make sure the prices we are promising users don’t lose us money but are fair.”

On the other hand, at least traders at OTC desk Cumberland don’t appear to be concerned about long-term instability.","Binance and its local subsidiary have set up a $50 million fund to reinvigorate growth in blockchain startups in India following a Supreme Court decision to allow banks to service crypto firms.

Binance and India-based bitcoin exchange WazirX – which Binance acquired in November – announced Tuesday their new “Blockchain for India” fund would incubate and invest in local startups that contribute to the creation of a sophisticated cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem for the subcontinent.

The new fund comes weeks after the Indian Supreme Court lifted a central bank-imposed ban that prevented cryptocurrency businesses from accessing financial services. Some exchanges added support for bank account transfers within hours of the court ruling.

The new Binance-backed fund, which will make investments in both equity and token acquisitions, is especially interested in initiatives that help develop a full crypto market infrastructure for India, according to a press release. That could include fiat gateways, remittance platforms, stablecoin solutions and new applications for decentralized finance (DeFi).

Worth a total of $50 million, the fund will make investments anywhere between $100,000 and $5 million.

Highlighting that India had one of the largest developer and software engineering talent pools in the world, WazirX founder and CEO Nischal Shetty said in a statement the new fund would make full use of the “incredible potential that the Indian blockchain ecosystem has to offer.”

The new fund would be open to collaborating and co-investing with other local funds sharing the same goals, Shetty said. There will also be an initiative for supporting blockchain development and incubator programs in Indian universities.","The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) is reportedly developing a regulatory sandbox for cryptocurrency companies in the country. The news was reported on March 16 by local newspaper Chronicle, citing a representative from the bank speaking at a conference on March 13.

Chronicle reports that RBZ’s deputy director for financial markets and national payment systems, Josephat Mutepfa, revealed that the bank is working on a regulatory framework that would see companies involved with cryptocurrency go through a special regulatory sandbox.

The sandbox will reportedly help the bank decide if a particular company can be allowed to operate independently. Speaking at the Sound Prosperity Economic Forum in Bulawayo, Musephat said:

“Once you enter the sandbox you either exist as a bonafide product to enter the market or you are guided to say that you need to partner a bank, a mobile money platform or your product needs to be licensed like a microfinance company.”

The decision to regulate crypto has been motivated by its growing popularity with the country’s younger generations, who Musephat says “are facing challenges of having capital.”

He admitted that digital currencies pose a regulatory challenge, as currency “was a prerogative of central banks.”

Zimbabwe’s troubled history with currencies

The African country is popularly known for its history of hyperinflation, with the Zimbabwe dollar seeing three redenominations to remove excess zeros since its introduction in 1980.

In 2009, the currency was removed as Zimbabwe officially became a country without its own fiat money, using a combination of several foreign currencies like the South African rand and U.S. dollar instead.

The lack of its own monetary policy did not ease the government’s stance toward cryptocurrency, as the RBZ issued a complete ban in 2018.

Since June 2019, Zimbabwe is once again trying to establish its own national currency. This appears not to be proceeding smoothly, as a local tourist guidance website warns that obtaining physical Zimbabwe dollars is very difficult.

The difficult situation in the country may be one of the reasons why peer-to-peer exchange of crypto is rising. Fostering adoption through concise regulations might help the country in finally solving its monetary issues.","DBL Digital, a division of DrawBridge Lending, announced on Monday the launch of its Bitcoin Managed Account Program (MAP) for individual and institutional investors.

According to DBL Digital, the program provides investors with exposure to the Crypto market in a risk-mitigated fashion, although virtual currency futures and options on futures present several risks related to the underlying virtual currency that should be considered prior to trading them.

DBL also noted that the program targets overlay returns at a specific upside call price and offers a hedge against bitcoin price declines. Speaking about the program, Jason Urban, CEO of DBL Digital, stated:

“Enhanced levels of volatility in Cryptocurrency markets have created exciting investment opportunities through traditional options strategies. We’ve developed the Bitcoin MAP to give investors exposure to Crypto along with an opportunity to capture enhanced returns on the price of bitcoin.”

DBL is also offering Accredited and Eligible Contract Participant (ECP) investors with additional opportunities through options hedging strategies to create yield on bitcoin held in a segregated wallet at a qualified custodian in cold storage. The company added that all of its programs provide clients with a “white-glove” service experience, operating within full risk mitigation and compliance.","A new version of Russia’s delayed bill on digital assets will include a ban on issuing and selling cryptocurrencies, according to the country’s central bank.

Bank of Russia (BoR) remains in favor of what are being called digital financial assets, and even tested a pilot tokenization project in its regulatory sandbox last December. In an interview with the Russian news agency Interfax, however, its head of legal office Alexey Guznov said the institution did not believe cryptocurrency issuance and trading should be legal in the country.

“We believe there are big risks of legalizing the operations with the cryptocurrencies, from the standpoint of financial stability, money laundering prevention and consumer protection,” Guznov said.

The bank took an active part in discussing the digital asset legislation, which has been waiting to be heard in Russia’s parliament since last spring. So far, it describes the rules for issuing security tokens in Russia, without mentioning cryptocurrency at all.

The central bank contributed to a second draft of the bill in the fall of 2019, clarifying the requirements for the issuers of such tokens, Guznov said. In particular, the issuer should report capital of no less than $660,000 (5 million Russian rubles) and be able to provide the access to the ledger to law enforcement if needed.

However, BoR is still reluctant to let tokens that are not securities, like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) , gain a legal standing in Russia.

“Now we’ve approached consensus with other government bodies and market players that participate in the discussion. That consensus might be that nobody is going to ban owning cryptocurrencies,” Guznov said, adding that crypto “in the end, is not drugs or arms.”

But “legalization of issuance and, which is even more important, circulation of cryptocurrencies pose an unjustified risk, which is why the [future] law prohibits issuing and organizing the market for cryptocurrencies, and also introduces the punishment for violating the ban,” according to Guznov.

People will not be punished for owning crypto “if they made their deal in a jurisdiction that does not prohibit that,” he explained, but institutions that make crypto trading and usage possible would be outlawed under the bill.

The bill might finally get passed during this spring session of the parliament, Guznov also indicated.

Bank of Russia’s leadership has been consistently skeptical about cryptocurrencies for the past couple of years. In October 2017, the regulator’s chairwoman, Elvira Nabiullina, said cryptocurrencies, just like private money, should not be legal in Russia. Last autimn, she also said Russia does not need its own national digital currency.","Bitfinex, the major cryptocurrency exchange and partner firm of stablecoin Tether (USDT) is listing a multi-million-dollar cryptocurrency hedge fund.

The exchange announced on March 16 that it has listed Bahamas-based crypto hedge fund Fulgur Alpha, which is currently worth $280 million dollars.

According to the Bitfinex, the fund — which is only accessible to professional investors — aims to increase its assets under management this year.

Fulgur Alpha’s assets are held at licensed crypto-asset custodian Delchain Limited and the fund’s regulatory compliance is ensured by Bahamas-based administrator Deltec Fund Services and a division of financial services firm Deltec International Group.

Executive head of operations at Delchain Bruno Macchialli explained that the fund is set up in a traditional way that features risk diversification. According to Macchialli, the fund is a “blueprint for institutional investment in crypto.”

The rise of cryptocurrency hedge funds

As Cointelegraph reported in mid-February, the first month of this year was the best January ever reported by crypto hedge funds. While in January those funds experienced a 21.15% return, February 2020 saw the same funds shed 1.31% with presumably significant losses to follow in March, as the coronavirus crisis continues to wreak havoc in markets.

Hedge funds that are not specifically meant for investors interested in cryptocurrencies have seen a positive influence when crypto assets were included. In the first half of 2019, the hedge fund of famous investor Bill Miller saw over 40% growth thanks in part to including Bitcoin (BTC).",
2020-03-17,"Opera has added a new feature to its browsers, which allows U.S. users to buy bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) directly from its in-built crypto wallet.

Opera has partnered with payments firm Wyre for the initiative, which supports both Apple Pay and debit cards to purchase the two cryptocurrencies.

“Wyre provides a very elegant web-based solution that was simple to integrate and is very simple to use. Their support of Apple Pay is a huge plus for our iOS users,” Charles Hamel, head of crypto at Opera, told The Block.

The fees charged by Wyre are “extremely competitive” and are $0.30 + 2.9% per transaction, an Opera spokesperson person told The Block.

The new feature is available for Opera’s all three browsers: Android, iOS browser Opera Touch, and desktop browser.

“Users can purchase as little as $1 worth of crypto, and there is a maximum daily limit of $250,” the spokesperson person told The Block. “As our browser-based wallet is focused around the usage of cryptocurrencies on the web and using dApps [decentralized applications], we expect the vast majority of transactions will not hit that limit.”

Opera said Wyre’s solution helps users buy bitcoin and ether in “less than 30 seconds” as compared to ""hours or days"" via some crypto exchanges.

Notably, Opera already supports the feature for the Scandinavian countries - Norway, Sweden, and Denmark - since February 2019. For that initiative, Opera’s partner is Sweden-based crypto brokerage Safello.

Today’s news comes over a year after the Scandinavian initiative. “The key challenge was to find the right partners,” for the U.S. effort, the Opera spokesperson told The Block, adding:

“We are planning to expand this feature to more countries very soon.”



The spokesperson declined to comment on how many users currently utilize the feature in the Scandinavian countries. Opera claims to have 360 million monthly active users worldwide.

Notably, peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms Paxful and LocalBitcoins already support payments via Apple Pay.","The Opera browser app has partnered with e-payments startup Wyre to expand its built-in wallet’s crypto buying power, the Norwegian web developer announced Tuesday.

In a deal that primarily caters to mobile crypto buyers in the U.S., the Opera–Wyre partnership brings Apple Pay functionality to iOS and debit card integration to Android. It lets users of either system purchase up to $250 in bitcoin or ether daily, for a 30 cent fee plus a 2.9 percent transaction commission, Opera’s Head of Crypto Charles Hamel told CoinDesk.

That’s not a very high ceiling, Hame said, but it’s meant to appeal to dapp developers and day-to-day users, not investors and speculators looking to move well over $250 in crypto a day.

“As our browser-based wallet is focused around the usage of cryptocurrencies on the web and using dApps, we expect the vast majority of transactions will not hit that limit,” he said.

It’s part of Opera’s larger, long-term mission: become the go-to browser for Web 3.0. The browser has already taken strides towards that goal, adding TRON support, an Ethereum dapp-compatible desktop version, crypto mining protective layers and a wealth of other built-in blockchain features that other leading browsers only offer through third-party extensions.

Opera already supported bitcoin payments through its native wallet.

On-the-go fiat on-ramps make it yet more simple for Opera’s dapp-using community to interact with blockchain projects, Hamel said. He touted its 30 second transaction settlement time, as Wyre has custody over all the crypto assets sold.","Opera has just announced that users can now buy Bitcoin and Ethereum through its browser using Apple Pay.

Announced today, the news states:

Oslo – Opera was the first browser to introduce Web 3 capabilities and a built-in crypto wallet across all of its mobile and desktop browsers. The Norwegian company is now letting its US users easily purchase cryptocurrencies using a debit card or Apple Pay. Easy crypto top ups are available in Opera's flagship Android browser, its iOS browser Opera Touch as well as in the crypto wallet available in its desktop browser.

The service is now available. Opera was the world's first blockchain-enabled browser, featuring a built-in crypto wallet for both iOS and Android. The release further states:

In the US, Opera is partnering with Wyre, a US cryptocurrency-brokerage firm, to enable easy and secure crypto-purchases directly from the browser's crypto wallet. Opera Android users in the US can now buy BTC and ETH using a debit card. iOS users can simply use Apple Pay. Charles Hamel, Head of Crypto at Opera browsers, explained how this integration supports Opera's long-term vision of making blockchain technology relevant beyond speculation: ""Allowing our users to easily load cryptocurrency into their browser's digital wallet is very powerful, as it connects the Web to a global internet-native payment network.""

The news means that users will get their accounts topped up in less than 30 seconds when paying with Apple Pay. Check out the video below!","Modern digital currencies stand at the precipice of ground-breaking legal change with the introduction of the U.S. Crypto-currency Act of 2020: a bill introduced by Republican Congressman Paul Gosar. While BTC “permabulls” have been predicting the inevitability of a “bitcoin ETF” for years now, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) dropped BTC trading altogether, and both BAKKT and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) have seen mostly downward trends in trading volume for most of the last 12 months. Since 2017, there have been promises of incoming “institutional money,” but it never quite makes it over the finish line.

Why is that?

The reason is complex, but one of the major blockers is that Bitcoin is poorly understood by people that do not have a basic grasp of laws and regulations, and until recently there had not been a legal issuer to take responsibility for creation of the database or the assets therein. In the absence of Satoshi, who went quiet in 2010, the legal definition of Bitcoin was left to a disconnected and idealistic community of monetary activists and early adopters who broadly fit the definition of “crypto-anarchists.” These activists were looking primarily for a tool to facilitate black and gray markets and damage the monetary monopoly of the state.

While in some ways, this was to be expected with a disruptive new technology, it was very problematic for legitimate business use and institutional adoption who are required to fall into line with the law. For example, no publicly traded company can utilize a database without full clarity on how the data is secured and how it is regulated. This is why Craig Wright stresses so brazenly that Bitcoin is not a “new” class of asset or database. It should be regulated under existing laws which cover monetary policy, digital rights, KYC/AML and various other established laws so that friction toward commercial adoption can be reduced!

So what does this new bill do?

The House ‘‘Crypto-Currency Act 5 of 2020’’ does not look like it will be ushering in the bullish mania that the HODL-culture has been praying for either. In fact, the same week that it was announced, the digital currency markets had the worst single day of trading—maybe ever! But it does aim to bring clarity to a lot of the long-held “what-ifs” that have plagued the bitcoin economy for years.

One of the most valuable and intriguing aspects of the new bill is the way that it clarifies its definitions of the different types of digital assets and the agencies that should regulate them:

Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): “crypto-commodity” Payment coins such as Bitcoin.

Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN): “crypto-currency” Synthetic derivatives of fiat currencies such as tether.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): “crypto-security” ICO tokens or anything used to represent investments or debts.



These definitions, while valuable as a piece of clarification on how they should be regulated and used in the marketplace is a big, punctuated reminder of the dirty word that the crypto-anarchist intelligentsia refuses to believe they are beholden to:

The Law

The most schizophrenic thing about the “institutional money” meme is that somehow everyone outside the Bitcoin SV economy believes that their cryptocurrency investments can be simultaneously adopted by businesses and institutional investors while also passing some sort of vague anarchist purity test. This madness must end.

Take BCH and Monero (XMR) for example: at the protocol level, both networks utilize bundled signatures (Shnorr for BCH, and Ring Signatures for XMR) and Monero even uses a mixed data set at the base layer, as well. Meanwhile, BCH pushes layer two mixing services based on “CoinJoin” protocols in some of their most popular wallets. While these things are interesting technological innovations, they are the aforementioned regulatory black swan! Dr. Craig Wright has previously (and repeatedly) noted the problems this will cause to all chains:

“Section 4.5 of the FinCEN monetary guidance explains not only that enhanced CVC transactions are without exception required to be registered, but that the mere use of something like the built-in mixer in CoinJoin acts to alter the basic function of Bitcoin or BitCHcoin such that it is covered and must be registered as an MSB. Anyone running such a system needs to prove that all of the coins involved in mixing did not come from a U.S. citizen. Moreover, the same applies to the U.K., Europe, and many other countries. To prosecute, a treasury or an FBI agent would simply need to send money to the site and enable mixing. If a single fake U.S. account can be set up, it is criminally a breach of the law.”

To lend more credence to the often-derided predictions of Dr. Wright, the new House bill introduces language that reinforces existing law as it pertains to legally transacting value, stating in regards to the illegal nature of coin mixers:

Another bright spot for transparency is that the House bill makes very specific demands for stablecoin reserves to be audited by the Secretary of the Treasury. This could spell the end of the era of fear over fractional reserve assets such as the 74% collateralized “tether” stablecoin and the recently encumbered “DAI” stablecoin asset issued by “MakerDAO” on the Ethereum blockchain.

So what now?

That is the real question. While the house bill is, in many ways, a step in the right direction, it could also be a redundant and confusing addition to existing law. Now, as we juggle on the brink of global economic catastrophe, it would be exciting to have institutional adoption of Bitcoin SV as the global database for business, but the crystal ball has suddenly become very murky as markets around the world contract due to the increasing, existential threat of the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus.

One thing is for sure: with or without “The Crypto-Currency Act” or the small blockers’ collective hope for the collapse of the fiat economy, Bitcoin SV is ready to rise to the challenge of transacting enterprise-level data today for anyone bold enough to take the first step!

Users holding up to 5 bitcoins now will earn a 6% annual percentage yield (APY) as compared to 3.6% APY currently.

Ether holders, on the other hand, will earn 4.5% APY for up to 500 ETHs as compared to 2%-3.6% APY currently. Interest rates on stablecoins Gemini dollar (GUSD) and USD Coin (USDC), on the other hand, will remain unchanged at 8.6% APY.



The move appears to be unusual, given that interest rates are down in traditional financial markets amid coronavirus risks.



Zac Prince, founder and CEO of BlockFi, told The Block that there are two key factors enabling the firm to raise interest rates: ""Supply constraint as other market participants have pulled back on their lending activities, and ample opportunities for market-making and arbitrage coming out of the extreme volatility that we experienced last week.""



""The next few weeks will be interesting as we will see if assets like gold and bitcoin decouple from the public equities market. In times of extreme panic, every asset is typically sold. After the dust settled in 2008, gold performed very well and we will see if bitcoin experiences a similar cycle,"" Prince added.



He went on to say that BlockFi's balance sheet is ""stronger than ever and shifts in the institutional lending markets have created opportunities that expand our margin.""



BlockFi has also reported fewer loan liquidations during last week's bitcoin crash, ""with zero losses in the lending book."" The firm said it did not liquidate USD loan client collateral below a price of ~$4,500, despite the market reaching lows of ~$3,800.



Founded in 2018, BlockFi has grown significantly within two years. The firm's revenues grew over 20 times in 2019, and it currently boasts more than $650 million in assets on the platform.



Just last week, BlockFi added support for cash transfers to let non-crypto users buy their first $10 worth of crypto and earn interest on it.



The firm is backed by notable investors, including Valar Ventures and Morgan Creek Digital. It has raised over $100 million in funding to date, according to Crunchbase. Most recently, it raised $30 million in a Series B round.","Google Pay users can now make payments with cryptocurrencies, thanks to a tie-up with Coinbase’s debit card offering.

The cryptocurrency exchange announced Tuesday that Coinbase Cards can now be added to users’ Google Pay wallets, enabling crypto-backed payments from Google Pay-enabled devices, such as phones or smartwatches, apparently for the first time.

Based in San Francisco, Coinbase launched its new Visa debit card for U.K. and European customers in April 2019.

The card initially only supported payments in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH). In November, this was expanded to include digital assets including XRP, basic attention token (BAT) and stellar lumens (XLM).

The new Google Pay feature will be available to users based in some European countries including the U.K. and Ireland, as well as Spain, France, Italy and Sweden. Neighboring countries will be added sometime later this year.","Amid historic drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Atlanta-based cryptocurrency startup Bakkt has announced the closing of a $300 million Series B funding round.

Atlanta-based company Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange and nearly two dozen additional global exchanges, launched Bakkt in August 2018 to create a “global, regulated ecosystem for digital assets.” The company aims to help regulated institutions and consumers alike take advantage of the increasingly popular $1.2 trillion digital currency market.

Investors included parent company IE, as well as Microsoft’s M12, PayU, Boston Consulting Group, Goldfinch Partners, CMT Digital, and Pantera Capital. The company also announced the creation of a new consumer-facing app and a payment integration with Starbucks that will enable customers to pay for their purchases with digital currency.

The company’s funding round, announced in a Medium blog post written by CEO Mike Blandina, will be used to “leverage the technology, infrastructure and partners across our businesses to bring innovative new products to market and in doing so expand access to the global economy.”

However, the stock market appears to be in free fall at the moment, taking cryptocurrency prices down with it.

The Dow nosedived by a whopping 2,997 points, or 12.93 percent, and dipped to 20,188.52 on Monday, closing at its lowest total since May 2017. The crash, related to a global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, represented the index’s biggest percentage drop since the “Black Monday” crash of 1987 — and the largest point decline in its history.

Many investors believe that cryptocurrency might provide a bit of a safe haven, considering its rapid rise in 2019, but its value has cratered as well. Bitcoin has lost some 30 percent in the past five days, dipping below $6,000 for the first time since last May and briefly sliding below $5,000 yesterday. What’s more, other cryptocurrency exchanges have lost as much as 60 percent of their value over the past month.

As Yahoo! Finance reported yesterday, “Coronavirus, a so-called black swan event, has become such a massive shock to the global economy that basically every asset class is down, creating a risk-off environment in which crypto, already a notoriously risky investment, isn’t very attractive. Investors are hurriedly selling off stocks, and they’re not moving that cash into crypto.”

Bakkt provides a federally regulated futures exchange and clearinghouse, as well as a warehouse designed to protect customers’ digital assets. The company’s Bitcoin Futures and Options contracts offer customers a fully regulated marketplace for the price discovery of bitcoin and help them manage the risks associated with the market.

In addition, Bakkt helps everyday people enter and take advantage of the digital currency market.

“We take a broad view of digital assets,” Blandina continued. “Whether it’s miles from your favorite airline, loyalty points from the local grocery store, or bitcoin you’ve purchased, the Bakkt app enables you to aggregate all of these assets into a single digital wallet.”

Following Bakkt’s acquisition of customer loyalty solutions provider Bridge2 Solutions in February, the company also announced that its long-awaited consumer app will launch this summer. The app, according to Blandina, will let consumers use digital currency to shop, give out to friends, and even convert them to cash.

“With the launch of the Bakkt app, we will, for the first time, offer consumers a robust platform to consolidate and use all of their digital assets, from crypto to loyalty points to in game tokens, in one user-friendly wallet,” said Blandina said in a statement last month. “Combining Bridge2 Solutions’ embedded relationships with banks and merchants and their innovative Loyalty Pay solution will enable us to launch new products that further drive loyalty and empower consumers to trade, transfer and spend digital assets in entirely new ways.”

As a result of the acquisition, Bakkt has expanded to 350 employees and now powers the loyalty redemption programs for seven of the top 10 financial institutions and more than 4,500 loyalty and incentive programs around the world.

“Bakkt was created to help bring transparency and trust to the previously unregulated digital asset markets,” Intercontinental Exchange founder, chairman, and CEO Jeffrey Sprecher said in a statement. “ Bakkt’s … acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions will help accelerate the development of Bakkt’s consumer application, which has been a key part of our strategy since we first looked at this market.”

Hodling in difficult times has historically proven to be a long-term winning strategy. Keeping your cryptocurrency in your own cold storage is by default a good idea as far as security is concerned. But if you don’t trust yourself to not lose a small hardware device or a piece of paper, then there are alternatives that involve trusting others, for good or bad.

Bunker in the Alps Sounds Like a Good Option

Companies providing vault storage services for crypto assets gained prominence a couple of years ago, following the Bitcoin boom that brought many new investors into the space. A few of them have already established themselves as reliable platforms for crypto storage. Hong Kong-headquartered bitcoin wallet and cold storage provider Xapo is a good example. In the spring of 2018, it was revealed that the company held an estimated 6.25% of BTC’s almost $160 billion market capitalization at the time, or more than 1,000,000 BTC.

Xapo, founded by Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares, attracted media attention with its focus on building ultra-secure facilities for cryptocurrency storage. The company had reportedly built a network of underground vaults on five continents, most notably one in a decommissioned military bunker in Switzerland, where clients’ private keys are kept on encrypted drives behind steel doors designed to withstand a nuclear blast and guarded by security personnel and systems. Even owners would need a couple of days to get access to their money.

In August 2019, U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase bought Xapo’s institutional businesses. Announcing the acquisition, the trading platform revealed that its Coinbase Custody subsidiary had grown to over $7 billion in assets under custody in just over a year since its launch in July 2018. The funds are stored on behalf of more than 120 clients in 14 countries, the company detailed. Coinbase acknowledged Xapo’s expertise in security techniques. Its custody arm now serves hedge funds, family offices, endowments, and proprietary trading desks, supporting major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH and XRP. The assets are insured by global leaders such as Lloyd’s of London.

Switzerland a Magnet for Crypto Riches

With its crypto-friendly regulations, Switzerland is very attractive for companies operating with cryptocurrencies and over 800 of them are based or represented in the country, including providers and developers of crypto custody solutions. Another company working in the niche, California-based Bitgo, announced in February the establishment of new custodial entities in Switzerland and Germany, which introduced a licensing regime for crypto custodians. The Swiss subsidiary is based in Zug, epicenter of the Alpine nation’s Crypto Valley. Both firms are regulated in their respective jurisdictions and will address increased European demand.

Bitgo is a major player with global presence in the market for institutional grade security solutions for blockchain-based currencies. Its Bitgo Custody platform employs a multi-signature system to secure your digital assets including security tokens. It supports a total of more than 100 coins and tokens that can be held with the Bitgo Trust Company, a qualified custodian and liquidity provider, in a cold storage bank-grade vault.

The service implements various controls including multiple approvals, spending limits, and whitelists, Bitgo’s website explains. The company’s $100 million insurance policy covers crypto assets when the private keys are held exclusively by Bitgo Trust Company or Bitgo Inc., in the event of third-party hacks, copying, theft or loss of private keys, insider theft or dishonest acts by Bitgo employees or executives.

Bitcoin Suisse is a Zug-based company specializing in crypto-financial services offering cold storage for digital assets. The Bitcoin Suisse Vault has been built to provide institutional-grade and fully audited crypto asset custody. The platform caters to the specific needs of its clients allowing them to customize the multi-signing process and define who can view and withdraw the stored assets. Besides corporate users such as financial service providers and institutional investors, private investors can also use it to store a list of cryptocurrencies including BTC, BCH, ETH, XRP, LTC as well as ERC20/223 tokens.

Bitcoin Suisse Vault is based on a solution developed by Swiss Crypto Vault AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bitcoin Suisse AG. Clients can deposit funds into the Swiss Crypto Vault by sending the coins to a unique public address, and their holdings are never mixed with assets belonging to others. Withdrawals are initiated by filing a request through the online portal which has to be verified independently by the user, Swiss Crypto Vault and Bitcoin Suisse before its execution, which can still be canceled by controllers appointed by the client. Before a transaction can be broadcasted to the blockchain, it must also get the green light from approvers, again chosen by the account holder.

More Providers Working on Storage Solutions

Other companies are developing their own safe storage solutions for cryptocurrencies. Metaco’s institutional custody platform, Silo, implements a hot-to-cold digital asset management technology. It’s a solution that integrates both software and hardware elements. It’s designed for banks which need a self-custody infrastructure that gives them control over their custodial activities. Silo was announced in January 2018 and has been developed together with data security agency Guardtime. It’s used by platforms such as Swiss Crypto Exchange (SCX). Metaco is now preparing to launch Cargo, a regulated service for smaller institutions looking for external digital asset storage.

Traditional financial institutions venturing into the crypto space are also working to offer custodial services. Last year, Arab Bank (Switzerland) joined forces with the blockchain company Taurus to provide its customers with custody and brokerage for their crypto holdings. Taurus is also helping Bank Vontobel to operate a digital asset vault allowing institutional investors to store and trade cryptocurrencies outside their balance sheets. Falcon Private Bank and digital trading platform Swissquote provide custodial solutions to investors interested in token sales through partnerships in the crypto industry. In January, Swiss bank Julius Baer teamed up with licensed crypto bank SEBA to offer storage for digital assets, and Liechtenstein’s blockchain banking provider Bank Frick introduced support for bitcoin cash (BCH) to its storage solutions.

SIMETRI ⁠— Crypto Briefing’s institutional-grade research product positioned and priced for the retail investor ⁠— provides in-depth fundamental analysis and unbiased, detailed insights into cryptocurrency projects. Each report is concluded with a concise investment grade ⁠— now available to tens of millions of users on CoinMarketCap.

These ratings were integrated on major digital asset resources CoinGecko and Binance Info last year.

Beyond Price and Volume Data

Starting today, CoinMarketCap users can visit individual crypto asset pages, and find the new information under the “Ratings” tab.

Crypto Briefing’s ratings metric analyzes dozens of fundamental factors to assess the investability and potential long-term profitability of crypto assets. These factors are provided as an easy-to-understand digital asset grade, allowing investors to look beyond price and volume data to get a more holistic view of the market.

By incorporating fundamental analysis in an easy-to-understand digital asset grade it allows investors to look past price and volume data to get a more holistic view of the market.

Combined with CoinMarketCap’s recently launched Liquidity Metrics, retail investors can now get a level of detail into markets not previously accessible to the public.

“Crypto Briefing has systematically reported on and evaluated hundreds of digital assets. Our connections and expertise allow us to provide valuable recommendations to investors,” said Han Kao, CEO of Crypto Briefing.

Blockchain data providers TokenInsight and IntoTheBlock will also be featured alongside Crypto Briefing on CoinMarketCap.

Data Transparency for the Crypto Investor

Inclusion of Crypto Briefing’s SIMETRI digital asset ratings is part of CoinMarketCap’s Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA) initiative, which was first unveiled in May 2019. DATA is CoinMarketCap’s ongoing bid to provide transparency and verifiable order book data from exchanges. Crypto Briefing is currently the only crypto-media publication involved in the initiative.

The initiative follows widespread concerns around cryptocurrency market manipulation. Last year, Bitwise released an in-depth analysis of exchange markets and found that roughly 95% of Bitcoin trading volumes may be fabricated through wash trading.

“Crypto Briefing, TokenInsight, and IntoTheBlock are highly respected in the industry for their informative and in-depth offerings, and I’m sure our users will benefit greatly from their valuable data and ratings,” said Carylyne Chan, Chief Strategy Officer of CoinMarketCap.

2020-03-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - As worries over the economic hit from the coronavirus outbreak spread from stocks, oil and bonds to cryptocurrencies late last week, bitcoin crashed to its worst day in seven years. But plummeting prices weren’t the only problem for investors.

FILE PHOTO: Illumination of the stock graph is seen on the representations of virtual currency Bitcoin in this picture illustration taken taken March 13, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic

As volatility and volumes spiked, the infrastructure underpinning digital coin trading creaked under the strain.

Futures exchanges saw a rash of electronically-triggered liquidations of leveraged positions, fuelling pressure on prices. Spreads between exchanges jumped. And at least two major exchanges went down, leaving investors locked out of the market for well over an hour.

Bitcoin prices collapsed nearly 40% on March 12, the biggest one-day drop since spring 2013, before jumping 16% a day later.

Volatility raced to its highest in seven years, with volumes across major cryptocurrency exchanges soaring to $30.8 billion on March 12-13, data from industry website CryptoCompare shows -- among the four highest two-day totals on record.

As the turmoil gripped markets, New York exchange Gemini said it fell offline for less than 90 minutes. Seychelles-based BitMEX, one of the world’s biggest platforms for leveraged derivatives trading, went down twice, for a total of 45 minutes.

A spokeswoman for Gemini said the exchange “observed a technical issue impacting a subset of our customers.”

“In an abundance of caution, and to protect the integrity of our marketplace, we paused the market to resolve the issue and ensure all market services were back online in a healthy state prior to reopening,” she said.

Gemini declined to detail the problem, or comment on whether it was caused or exacerbated by market moves.

BitMEX said its outages were due to denial-of-service cyberattacks that stopped messages from reaching its trading engines. The unidentified attackers “waited for the moment their attack would make the most market impact” and overwhelmed the platform “during a moment of peak volatility”, it said.

The outages were a reminder of the fragility of key components in crypto markets, underscoring the dangers of a high-risk asset that large investors typically steer clear of.

And while most exchanges continued as normal during the turbulence, the Gemini and BitMEX episodes may also fuel doubts that bitcoin’s infrastructure is solid enough for it to work as an alternative to traditional currencies.

“There’s no way to say it’s good for the ecosystem when exchanges go down,” said Richard Galvin of crypto fund Digital Asset Capital Management.

(GRAPHIC: Bitcoin plummets - )

FRAGILE INFRASTRUCTURE?

As bitcoin struggles to evolve from rebel technology into mainstream asset, the outages underscore the fragility of the sector at times of stress, industry figures said.

“Volatility is not an issue -- it’s whether the technology can deal with the volatility.” said Denis Vinokourov at crypto exchange BeQuant.

Most crypto exchanges have bolstered their capacity to deal with high volatility and volumes, and the majority of major exchanges continued operating normally late last week.

But with crypto markets having been dogged by cyberattacks since their birth 12 years ago, exchanges should be better prepared, said Tim Swinson, head of market intelligence at Clearmatics, a London-based blockchain startup that designs peer-to-peer payment platforms.

“The fact that exchanges are still being taken down is par for the course, but it shouldn’t be an excuse,” he said. “It shouldn’t be normal.”

CIRCUIT BREAKERS

As bitcoin fell on Thursday, positions on major derivatives exchanges such as BitMEX, which offers highly leveraged trading, were automatically liquidated. That stoked pressure on prices, amplifying moves and accelerating bitcoin’s fall, traders said.

Yet unlike major stock exchanges that use circuit breakers to slam the brakes on trading during disruption or panic selling, crypto exchanges generally lack devices to arrest extraordinary price moves.

And in contrast to foreign exchange markets, in which central banks sometimes intervene, the mostly unregulated crypto sector is left to its own devices in times of unruly trading.

Last week’s moves raised questions over whether circuit breakers are needed in crypto.

“The tech is important,” said Vinokourov at BeQuant. “You’re inviting traditional, big firms to trade on platforms that may not be able to withstand the amount of trading.”

Circuit breakers do already exist at some exchanges.

Deribit, a Panama-based derivatives exchange, in November brought in circuit breakers to counter erratic price swings, said Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers. They were triggered on Thursday “to protect the market and our clients from extreme price volatility,” he added.

Yet many in the crypto sector say circuit breakers would be impractical for digital coin trading, which takes place across multiple exchanges, without coordinated introduction.

Asked whether it operates or plans to introduce circuit breakers, Gemini said: “The cryptocurrency market does not have circuit breakers.”

BitMEX said it does not operate circuit breakers. “To prevent negative feedback loops, we do not use the last price of our derivatives to trigger liquidations,” it added.

Others cite likely opposition to controls on crypto markets, rooted in the technology’s libertarian roots.

“If you put circuit breakers in, you also give up the freedoms of markets to find prices on their own,” said Galvin of the fund DACM.

“If you’re playing markets so that you can get super-high returns, you also need an approach that can sustain the bad sides.”

This was the first, yet we are told inaugural, Crypto AM awards, where developers and entrepreneurs alike gathered in the hope of walking away with a trophy. Some might be pondering whether cryptocurrency is still relevant, but on this occasion there was hardly an empty chair to be found.

Emphasis on education and sustainability

While the 12 categories focused on topics such as user experience and the Incubator/VC award, actually what was most telling was the emphasis on education and sustainability. With Bitcoin currently in freefall after its bounce last week, now is the time more than ever to concentrate on these topics if companies still want to be here next year.

The industry has always suffered with a marketing issue, that of the coins rather than the initiatives behind them. But good projects are still ongoing, from a coin to protect craft beer in Europe to a mobile phone network in rural Tanzania.

However, it was Kent-based Electroneum that took home the prestigious Social Impact & Sustainability Award. The company focus on allowing small payments to be sent across borders without exorbitant banking charges. What’s more, they have implemented both freelance and education platforms where the unbanked can supplement their income.

“Innovation for innovation’s sake”

While some people are asking if crypto is still relevant, Electroneum is already valued at $240bn, something that CEO Richard Ells believes is down to the financial needs of the poorest in society. He said, “You might find in blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation for innovations sake, but it does open up global remittance at virtually zero cost. Ultimately, that is how we can make a difference in the world.”

The company focuses on those wanting to make micropayments, and takes away the large fees that banks would often charge to transfer the cash.

Education services still required

Other big winners were blockchain and crypto education providers, proving that there is a need for these services but people need help in harnessing their power. Whether that’s a secure blockchain ledger, or developing a coin and ecosystem.

Cointelligence was the winner on the day, where its free academy sessions offer an insight to the markets and how to choose a wallet. For those interested in putting together a portfolio, their paid-for expert courses allow you to have confidence while trading in a relatively new and unstable territory.

London’s financial market may have over 400-years of history, but it is yet to realise the dramatic impact of cryptocurrency, something that will only become heightened with FCA regulation for e-payments by 2021.

Events such as these may provide a platform to shout about the successes, yet only when acknowledged alongside its failures.

Utah-based CoinZoom announced Wednesday it would begin onboarding new institutional and retail clients, and will offer a Visa payment card that instantly converts cryptocurrencies into U.S. dollars.

As a registered money service business with FinCEN in most U.S. states and territories, CoinZoom has to comply with local regulations, including those concerning consumer protection and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. The exchange is also licensed as a money transmitter in the U.S., as well as a digital currency exchange in Australia.

CoinZoom supports most prominent cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin (BC) or ether (ETH), in pairs with the U.S. dollar, providing a fiat gateway into the asset class. The platform also includes a staking facility for selected proof-of-stake (PoS) coins, which provide rewards for holders.

The exchange, which already has a trading app available for Apple iOS devices, can also be used as a remittance solution, according to CoinZoom founder and CEO Todd Crosland.

“CoinZoom is not only the first U.S. cryptocurrency exchange to provide a Visa card to its customers, but also offers … industry-first features like ZoomMe, CoinZoom’s free Peer-to-Peer crypto and fiat payment system,” he said","It seems that every time Bitcoin seems like it could break out toward new highs, its price comes plunging back down.

After surging earlier this year, Bitcoin's price is now down approximately 50% from its highs. In turn, many people are wondering if now is a good time to buy the popular cryptocurrency.

Here are some things to consider before making your decision.

Multiple events that should serve as fuel for gains have failed to prevent Bitcoin's price from plunging in recent weeks, including the following.



Stock market turmoil

The coronavirus pandemic has unleashed a wave of fear upon the global financial markets. Travel bans, school and business closures, and quarantines have been enacted around the world in an attempt to slow the spread of the disease. Investors, scared that these actions will cause the global economy to fall into a recession, have sold off stocks, leading to sharp losses in markets around the world.

Bitcoin has historically performed well during periods of stock market distress. Some people view Bitcoin as a chaos hedge, or a way to preserve and even increase their wealth when other assets plunged in value. The current market environment can certainly be considered chaotic, yet Bitcoin's price has plunged right along with stocks. This is disconcerting, as the cryptocurrency's ability to serve as a hedge against market turmoil is one of its most interesting use cases for investors.

Stimulus measures

To help ward off a recession and reduce the financial toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, central banks around the world have taken drastic measures to pump liquidity into the markets. While they could potentially help to stimulate the economy, these measures are also likely to deflate the value of the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies, by increasing the amount of money available.

In many ways, this situation is exactly what Bitcoin was created for. The cryptocurrency has a hard cap on its total supply of approximately 21 million coins. By having a finite supply, Bitcoin was designed to maintain its value while other currencies lost purchasing power due to inflation. But so far, central banks' stimulus measures have had little effect on Bitcoin's price, and it's unclear if they will in the near future.

Greater demand for digital payments

The coronavirus pandemic is also likely to accelerate the trend toward digital forms of value exchange. The World Health Organization is urging people to use contactless payments as a means to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, with central banks in several nations quarantining physical cash for periods of up to 14 days before releasing it back into circulation -- since novel coronavirus can reportedly survive for several days on surfaces -- the idea that touching cash could get you sick might lead more people to adopt digital payment technology.

In addition to a store of value, Bitcoin was designed to be ""a peer-to-peer electronic cash system."" So one would think that it would be perfectly suited for the current environment. But that's not yet true. Bitcoin's current inability to scale effectively makes it largely unsuitable as a payments network. New technologies, such as the Lightning Network, could help in this regard, but they're not ready for mass adoption just yet. As such, the need for more digital payment options is unlikely to boost Bitcoin's price any time soon.

Should you buy Bitcoin right now?

For these reasons, you may be best served by waiting to buy Bitcoin until it can better fulfill its primary use cases as a store of value and means of payment. There are certainly some events that could help to drive the cryptocurrency's price higher in the future, such as the ""halvening,"" which will cut Bitcoin's mining rewards in half and reduce its pace of new coin creation. But prices could also continue to fall, so there are plenty of risks to consider if you choose to buy today.","Two Canadian nationals have been sentenced to two years in a U.S. jail for stealing bitcoin from an Oregon resident through a Twitter scam.

Karanjit Singh Khatkar and Jagroop Singh Khatkar, both from Surrey, British Columbia, were sentenced on March 17 to 24 months in federal prison with three years supervised release for conspiring to commit wire fraud and money laundering involving bitcoin (BTC).

According to a U.S. Department of Justice Attorney’s Office press release Tuesday, a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation found the defendants sought to trick victims into thinking they were discussing customer service matters with representatives from Hong Kong-based crypto exchange HitBTC.

In October 2017, the defendants used a Twitter account with the handle @HitBTCAssist to pose as HitBTC staff to manipulate one victim into handing over 23.2 BTC (worth $118,000 at today’s prices) from a HitBTC wallet to Karanjit Khatkar’s wallet on the Kraken exchange.

The Khatkars also convinced the Oregon resident to hand over information that could be used to compromise the victim’s accounts including email as well as exchange account details.

Within days of the theft, the Khatkars split the bitcoin proceeds and proceeded to spend the liquidated cryptocurrency on a lavish lifestyle involving luxury cars and casinos.","The coronavirus crisis may highlight the overlap between the surveillance state and the cryptocurrency industry.

The Israeli tech company NSO Group, best known for selling spyware to Saudi Arabia and other governments, is reportedly working on a new product to monitor the spread of coronavirus. Nearly a dozen countries are testing the software, Bloomberg reported.

NSO Group’s surveillance technology has attracted widespread criticism from privacy-minded technologists in the crypto sector and beyond – for covertly accessing phones, activating cameras and collecting location data. Still, the company’s top ranks have significant ties to the blockchain industry, CoinDesk has learned.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Several NSO Group founders and investors are also funding blockchain companies. For example, co-founders Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio have invested in the bitcoin startup Simplex, while NSO Group investor Eddy Shalev has invested in the non-custodial wallet startup Portis, the exchange platform eToro and the privacy startup QEDIT. Eddy Shalev’s LinkedIn account also listed him as on the board of the bitcoin mining company Spondoolies Tech, which reportedly closed in 2016.

“There’s a lot of what the cryptocurrency space is doing that is recreating what is already happening with traditional finance,” QEDIT CEO Jonathan Rouach said of Eddy Shalev. “He was one of the first people to recognize that banks will be interested in the same [blockchain] technology, but maybe not public consensus [mechanisms].”

The three investors did not respond to requests for comment by press time. Another source with knowledge of QEDIT’s operations said the startup is not involved with the NSO Group’s coronavirus monitoring app.

Although it’s unclear how these investors personally interact with the bitcoin (BTC) market, a former NSO Group employee allegedly tried to sell stolen software for $50 million worth of cryptocurrency in 2018. A source familiar with the matter said the above-mentioned investors are active bitcoiners, but declined to provide more details.

Many bitcoiners imagine the crux of their movement lies in the divide between government agencies and cypherpunks. As a company making software tools for intelligence agencies, NSO Group shows there may be a significant overlap between the two worlds.

NSO Group isn’t the first case of such overlap either. Coinbase famously sparked industrywide backlash in 2019 when it acquired Neutrino, founded by three former members of a controversial Italian surveillance vendor called Hacking Team.","Total BCH Coin Supply: $500,000 USD worth of BCH token

SOURCE Crypto.com","Bitcoin (BTC) is again feeling the pull of gravity as investors offload risk in traditional markets despite the massive U.S. stimulus package this week.

The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $5,050, having failed to establish a strong foothold above $5,500 late Tuesday., according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Prices were better bid 24 hours ago when global equities were flashing green. Sentiment, however, soured during Wednesday’s Asian trading hours and futures tied to the S&P 500 fell by 5 percent, triggering a “limit down” – the maximum percentage decline possible in one trading day.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Asian equities also put in a weak performance, providing negative cues to the major European equity indices, which are currently down at least 3 percent.

“Global equities markets continue to reject stimulus efforts put forward by the U.S., with the S&P 500 recording its largest one day drop on Monday since 1987,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency rate cut of 100 basis points early Monday and announced new quantitative easing in the form of at least $700 billion in asset purchases. Further, the Trump administration said Tuesday it’s planning to send checks directly to U.S. citizens as part of a $1 trillion stimulus program.

Even so, the stock markets are flashing red, which likely indicates investors are worried that monetary easing will not spur economic activity. After all, the threat to global supply and demand is not being caused by institutional systemic failures but by measures related to the growing coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, a sustainable price recovery in both stocks and bitcoin may remain elusive until there is a stabilization in the coronavirus infection curve.

“However, if the impact of the coronavirus outbreak intensifies beyond the global lockdown we are already experiencing, it could spark a further run for cash,” Simon Peters, analyst and crypto-asset expert at multiasset investment platform eToro, told CoinDesk.

Should that happen, investors may again look to bitcoin as a source of liquidity, leading to another wave of selling.

Bitcoin is currently consolidating, showing indecision in the marketplace, said Peters. That seems to be the case as the cryptocurrency is stuck in a triangle pattern on an intraday chart.

4-hour chart

Bitcoin has carved out an ascending triangle that comprises two trendlines – a horizontal line connecting price resistance and a rising trendline joining higher lows.

A four-hour close above the upper edge of the triangle, currently at $5,945, would open confirm an ascending breakout and open the doors for $6,425 (December low).

However,

if the lower end of the triangle at $4,865 is breached, more sellers may join

the market, yielding a re-test of recent lows under $4,000.

Daily chart

The 14-day relative strength index is signaling oversold conditions with a below-30 reading, while the MACD histogram is producing higher lows below the zero line, a sign of weakening bearish momentum.

A triangle breakout on the 4-hour chart, if confirmed, could be followed by a quick rally to $6,000.","Why did this happen?

Bitcoin (BTC) is gaining amid a sell-off in fiat currencies and could rise further if the U.S. stock markets track European equities higher.

Technical charts indicate scope for a rise to key resistance at $5,926.

A move higher would confirm a breakout on the hourly chart and may propel prices toward $6,400.

Bitcoin is on the rise Thursday morning (UTC), showing resilience in the face of a global dash for dollars seen in the foreign exchange markets.

At time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading near $5,670, representing a 9.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Bitcoin found bids near $5,260 during the Asian trading hours and has been climbing since, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

While bitcoin is flashing green against the U.S. dollar, most fiat currencies are currently trading in the red. For example, the British pound-to-dollar exchange rate is hovering near 1.1555, the lowest level since 1980. The currency pair has dropped by nearly 8 percent this week.

The Australian dollar fell to a 20-year low of 55 U.S. cents early on Thursday and is currently reporting a 0.6 percent drop on the day.

The greenback has gained in the past six trading days against all major currencies, as noted by macro analyst Holger Zschaepitz.

The surge indicates many investors are selling everything, even safe havens like Japan’s yen and Swiss francs, to move their money into dollars over fears of a coronavirus-led recession in the global economy. “If cash is king, then dollar cash is currently being world president,” according to ING’s head of global markets.

Bitcoin, however, isn’t bowing down to the new cash overlord, and could see bigger gains if the U.S, equity markets put in a good performance in line with rising European stocks. At press time, the Euro Stoxx 50 – the eurozone’s benchmark index – has added 1.3 percent to its value.

A risk reset on Wall Street cannot be ruled out, as central banks from Australia to Canada have launched easing programs to inject massive amounts of liquidity into the system.

Bitcoin’s technical charts, too, are suggesting scope for a stronger recovery rally.

Daily chart

Bitcoin defended the psychological support of $5,000 on Wednesday and ended up producing a small hammer candle, validating seller exhaustion signaled on Monday.

A hammer candle occurs when sellers fail to keep prices at the lowest point of the day and is widely considered an early sign of a trend reversal.

The MACD histogram is printing higher lows below the zero line, indicating a drop in bearish momentum.

Hourly chart

Bitcoin produced a green marubozu candle in the 60 minutes to 10:00 UTC, which comprises a big body and small or no wicks. The bullish indicator shows buyers were in control from the session’s open to its close.

The odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to the top of the ascending triangle at $5,926. A high-volume break above that level could cause more bargain hunters to join the market, producing a stronger rise to the next resistance at $6,425 (December low).

Conversely, a triangle breakdown would open the doors for a re-test of the March 16 low of $4,446.","From sweeping liquidations to exchange outages, crypto market volatility over the past week created more than a few headaches for traders.

Yet there was at least one upside that emerged amid the fray: arbitrage opportunities.

Since March 12, a significant disparity has emerged between the price for BitMEX's perpetual swaps and bitcoin's spot price. Meanwhile, the stablecoin USDT – which is supposed to be one-to-one pegged tied to the U.S. dollar – has been trading at a premium. And bitcoin futures has also reversed the historical trend of printing a higher price than spot – it has been trading at a discount instead.

""The price is definitely very volatile still, so you do see good arbitrage opportunities,"" high-frequency trader Mike van Rossum told The Block.

The opportunities van Rossum referred to lie in those aforementioned price differences, or premiums, which in an efficient and stable market shouldn’t be too far away from 0.

However, last Thursday, bitcoin's price fell off the $7,900 cliff and it is now hovering around $5,800, triggering a slew of large scale liquidations and trading volumes surge.

On crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, total open interest dropped up to 18% on March 12, most of which was wiped out by liquidation. Bitcoin futures trading volumes across all exchanges surged to an all-time high, with the largest exchanges – BitMEX, OKEx, and Huobi – seeing $11 billion, $13 billion, and $8.6 billion in trading volume on March 12, respectively.

Futures arbitrage

As such, bitcoin futures' annualized three-month rolling basis, which calculates the price difference between futures and spot denominated by the spot price, tanked as much as -75% on crypto derivatives exchange FTX on March 13 – a state of affairs that van Rossum described as ""wild.""

In order to capture this spread, traders who usually long bitcoin and sell futures took a reversed strategy.

They short-sold bitcoin while purchasing BTC futures, then used the bitcoins they receive at the delivery date of the futures contract to cover the short position. Through this reverse cash and carry scheme, a trader could pocket the difference between the money she spent on the futures contracts – which are at a discount – to the money she earned from selling the BTC.

Premiums in swaps and USDT

Futures is not the only market that brews arbitrage opportunities. The premium index of BitMEX’s bitcoin perpetual swaps, which tracks the price difference between the derivatives contract and its underlying asset, tumbled to as low as -12% on March 12. During quieter times, that figure usually hovers around 0.1%.

USDT, the most liquid stablecoin on the market, also saw its premium spike to roughly 5% around the same time. This trend may continue as investors start to return to crypto now that BTC appears to have stabilized around $5,800 while equities market drags along the lower range. At least, that's the working theory at the center of an investor memo sent by crypto trading firm QCP Capital yesterday and reviewed by The Block.

""The fact that BTC isn't being dragged by lower equities or the higher USD shows real demand from the fiat to stables new money coming in. Huge premiums in USDT and BTC in onshore China & most other Asian markets right now,"" the note read.

""Lots of people are trading it [USDT] for various reasons – lots of over the counter USDT flow – creating some arbitrage opportunities,"" FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried noted in a message to The Block.

BTC loans in demand

These movements are also reflected in the flows some lending desks were seeing over the past week. Although crypto lenders usually see more robust demand for cash and stablecoin loans with BTC collateral, the split between cash and BTC loans have been around fifty-fifty recently as traders look to borrow BTC for short selling.

""We are seeing more 2 way flows now with BTC borrowing demand, because futures are at a discount so if you borrow BTC, you can sell spot versus buy future and earn a nice carry,"" said Tiantian Kullander, whose firm Amber Group runs a crypto lending desk along with other financial services.

To meet the increasing borrowing demand for bitcoin, crypto lender BlockFi kicked up its BTC interest rate yesterday to attract people to lend out their BTC.

""It is not too surprising to see large borrowers such as BlockFi raising the rates they can pay to borrow bitcoin or ether from their customers. They can then for instance lend at a profit to crypto hedge funds and lending desks that are looking to do the reverse cash carry trade or even implement [such a strategy] themselves,"" said Emmanuel Goh, who is the CEO of crypto derivatives data analytics firm Skew.

To be sure, by now, most of those premiums have been arbitraged away, as BitMEX’s premium index and BTC futures basis have reverted back to 0 and -10% range. However, there are still some spreads left for traders to capture.

As van Rossum who primarily trades in swaps, noted, ""in perp[etual swaps] the spreads aren't huge, but still plenty to go around.""","The arrival of Bitcoin opened doors to various new illicit cyber crime activities. While authorities are struggling to contain these, the continuing success of Bitcoin is fuelling it. Malware attacks showed some growth recently in which this crypto coin played a critical part. Hackers encrypt computer files, and unless they receive ransom paid in bitcoins, they refuse to undo the encryption.



Illegal expenditure in Bitcoin has reached new heights despite authorities’ hopes to clamp down on it by taking down online darknet markets. However, illegal purchases through this coin showed a slight decrease, generally speaking.

What are Darknet Markets?

The black online markets are called darknet markets. Activities on these markets include purchases of stolen credit card information and a variety of illegal drugs by using Bitcoin, among other crypto coins.



According to Chainalysis, a company that tracks all Bitcoin transactions and also serves as an advisor to various government authorities, a new high of $601 million was reached in BTC spending on darknet markets in the last quarter of 2019, which is an increase of 60%.



Bitcoin has earned a reputation as a sanctuary for villains, and the growing number of illegal Bitcoin transactions makes it extremely difficult for it to move past this reputation.



According to the new Crypto Crime Report released by Chainalysis, illegal activities involving Bitcoin almost doubled from the year before. It seems that illicit activities are part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, which are resistant to the fluctuations in its value.

Who is Winning the Battle?

The authorities have been aggressive in their approach to the so-called cryptocurrency schemes, along with the darknet. However, their efforts seem futile as fraudulent Bitcoin activities still manage to hit new heights. According to Chainalasys data, fraudsters took $3.5 billion from millions of victims last year, which is more than triple compared to 2018.



Silk Road, the first online black market, began accepting Bitcoin back in 2011. Since then, illegal transactions have been an integral part of the crypto world. Bitcoin doesn’t have any central authority, which makes it possible for anyone to open a wallet and use the currency without registering a real identity.



This structure made Bitcoin very useful for the Silk Road because it makes it easy for a criminal to move and use Bitcoin while remaining unidentified. According to The European Banking Authority (EBA), crypto assets are not usually according to the EU financial regulations, so building a context around individual transactions is very difficult.

Do We Need to Be Concerned About Crypto Crime?

According to Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, Bitcoin is a crummy currency to use for cybercrime and has substantial drawbacks for criminals. Selkis says that “Maybe it is good for petty crime, but if you are running a cartel, it is a different story.”



Unlike cash, which is mostly traceless and anonymous currency, blockchain technology is pseudo-anonymous. It behaves like an infinite and undeniable data register that houses all transactions ever made in particular crypto coins. It also allows for the money to be traced and followed by law enforcement agents.

Criminals, however, are not deterred by Bitcoin transactions leaving a trail. Agents cannot identify criminals involved in Bitcoin transactions straight away, but patterns in cryptocurrency movement can be spotted and studied to profile and de-anonymize suspects.

Tom Robison, the founder of Elliptic, which provides blockchain analysis service, said that rather than tracking criminals, their focus is on preventing money laundering. They provide financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges with tools that will allow them to screen transactions for links to illicit activity.

Robinson said that illegal activity gets discouraged by making it harder for criminals to launder their takings in cryptocurrency.

Final Notes

For as long as there are people on this planet, there will be crimes. Cybercrime is no different. As long as we remember to keep our online world as safe as possible, we can make it difficult for criminals.

Keep your crypto wallets secure by using security features like two-factor authentication and similar, and you will be reasonably safe.

","CoreWeave, the largest U.S. miner on the Ethereum blockchain, is redirecting the processing power of 6,000 specialized computer chips toward research to find a therapy for the coronavirus.

These graphics processing units (GPUs) will be pointed toward Stanford University’s Folding@home, a long-standing research effort that unveiled a project on Feb. 27 specifically to boost coronavirus research by way of a unique approach to developing pharmaceutical drugs: connecting thousands of computers from around the world to form a distributed supercomputer for disease research.

CoreWeave co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Brian Venturo said the project has at least a shot at finding a drug for the virus. As such, CoreWeave has responded by doubling the power of the entire network with its GPUs, which are designed to handle repetitive calculations.

According to Venturo, those 6,000 GPUs made up about 0.2 percent of Ethereum’s total hashrate, earning roughly 28 ETH per day, worth about $3,600 at press time.

There is no cure for the coronavirus just yet (though various groups are working on vaccines and research to combat the disease, including IBM’s supercomputer). Venturo noted that Folding@home has been used to contribute to breakthroughs in the creation of other important drugs.

“Their research had profound impacts on the development of front-line HIV defense drugs, and we are hoping our [computing power] will aid in the fight against coronavirus,” Venturo said.

The coronavirus is taking a toll across the world. Italy and Spain are on lockdown. Conferences, stores and restaurants are closing to stem the spread of the disease; by stoking fears, it’s slamming the financial markets in the process.

World computer

When the idea of using GPUs for coronavirus research was mentioned to CoreWeave, the team didn’t think twice.

They had a test system up and running “within minutes,” Venturo said. Since then, the project quickly snowballed. CoreWeave has been contributing over half of the overall computing power going into the coronavirus wing of Folding@home.

“The idea of ‘should we do this?’ was never really brought up, it kind of just happened. We were all enthusiastic that we might be able to help,” Venturo added.

Folding@home is a decentralized project in the same vein as Bitcoin. Instead of one research firm alone using a massive computer to do research, Folding@home uses the computing power of anyone who wants to participate from around the world – even if it’s just a single laptop with a little unused computing power to spare.

In this case, the computing power is used to find helpful information relating to the coronavirus. Much like in bitcoin mining, one user might detect a “solution” to the problem at hand, distributing this information to the rest of the group.

“Their protein simulations attempt to find potential ‘pockets’ where existing [U.S. federal agency Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] approved drugs or other known compounds could help inhibit or treat the virus,” Venturo said.

Viruses have proteins “that they use to suppress our immune systems and reproduce themselves. To help tackle coronavirus, we want to understand how these viral proteins work and how we can design therapeutics to stop them,” a Folding@home blog post explains.

Simulating these proteins and then looking at them from different angles helps scientists to understand them better, with the potential of finding an antidote. Computers accelerate this process by shuffling through the variations very quickly.

“Our specialty is in using computer simulations to understand proteins’ moving parts. Watching how the atoms in a protein move relative to one another is important because it captures valuable information that is inaccessible by any other means,” the post reads.

Long shot

Folding@home could use even more power. Venturo urges other GPU miners to join the cause.

Even without these calls for participation, though, miners of other cryptocurrencies are already independently taking action. Tulip.tools founder Johann Tanzer put out a call to action to Tezos bakers (that blockchain’s equivalent of miners) last week, promising to send the leading contributor to Folding@home a modest 15 XTZ, worth roughly $20 at press time.

The initiative blew up, to Tanzer’s surprise. Though they might not be contributing as much power as CoreWeave, 20 groups of Tezos miners are now contributing a slice of their hashing power to the cause. Tanzer’s pot has swelled to roughly $600 as Tezos users caught wind of the effort and donated.

But that’s not to say all miners can participate. While GPUs are flexible, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), a type of chip designed specifically for mining, aren’t, according to Venturo. Though ASICs are more powerful than GPUs, they’re really only made for one thing: To mine cryptocurrency. This is one advantage Venturo thinks Ethereum has over Bitcoin, since GPU mining still works on the former, whereas the latter is now dominated by ASICs.

“This is one of the great things about the Ethereum mining ecosystem, it’s basically the largest GPU compute resource on the planet. We were able to redeploy our hardware to help fight a global pandemic in minutes,” Venturo said. (However, it’s worth noting that Ethereum has seen ASICs enter the fray. Not to mention, ether miners might soon go extinct when a pivotal upgrade makes its way into the network.)

ASICs are useless for the Folding@Home effort, but if bitcoin miners have old GPUs lying around from the early days that they could contribute, too.

Even if other miners join up, though, it’s still a long shot that the effort will lead to a helpful drug.","In the aftermath of last week’s cryptocurrency market crash, the Huobi exchange has launched a liquidation mechanism that would pull the plug on trading should prices become too volatile.

The Singapore-based firm said Wednesday the new mechanism, integrated into its crypto derivatives marketplace, would halt all liquidations – where a trader’s position is automatically closed – during periods when volatility starts to present a real risk for traders.

Huobi’s new feature comes a week after several crypto derivatives exchanges reported record liquidations following a sudden collapse in the bitcoin price. BitMEX registered more than $700 million in just 15 minutes last Thursday as bitcoin (BTC) plummeted through its support levels.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Such sudden and large movements may catch traders by surprise leading to a sudden rise in volatility levels. Ciara Sun, Huobi’s vice president of global business, said market volatility can “lead to unnecessarily high-risk circumstances if the right measures aren’t in place to protect them.”

Liquidation risk mechanisms are commonplace in traditional markets where they are used to temporarily halt trading. Known as circuit breakers, they are activated to stop panic selling when markets come under sudden and extreme duress.

The New York Stock Exchange, for example, has activated circuit breakers in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and during the 2008 financial crisis. Stock exchanges all around the world, including NYSE, have recently been forced to trigger them again as the coronavirus pandemic sparked a global sell-off in equities.

Huobi’s mechanism doesn’t halt trading as does a conventional circuit breaker; it only halts liquidations on leveraged positions. It can also gradually liquidate positions, rather than doing so in a single event. There are some other exchanges that use a similar sliding mechanism, such as rival crypto derivatives platforms, Bybit and FTX.

In the past, crypto volatility levels have spiked following short or long squeezes – mass liquidations from unexpected changes in the underlying assets that exacerbate movements. Sun added that a partial liquidation mechanism could create a more “robust trading experience,” minimizing downside “without diluting the potential upside.”","As bitcoin (BTC) experiences vertigo-inducing gains, cryptocurrencies are breaking out of a period where they followed or even lagged behind traditional markets. In fact, prices in the crypto market are seeing such a steep upward trend that arbitrage traders are able to trade between Bitfinex and other exchanges to easily capture profit.

Bitcoin is up over 15 percent in the past 24 hours, changing hands at $6,206 as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET) Thursday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Meanwhile, the Nikkei 225 index closed its day at 05:00 UTC Thursday down 1 percent. That’s notable because recently crypto traders were looking at the Asian-based markets and indexes like the Nikkei for signals, which in the past week did create a brief correlation.

“It was surprising to see bitcoin’s correlation with a traditional index like the Nikkei 225 given bitcoin’s similarity to traditional stores of value like precious metals,” said Marc Grens, co-founder and president at DigitalMint, a bitcoin point-of-sale provider. “That being said, since the creation of the Bitcoin protocol, this is the first time we’ve seen the behavior of bitcoin holders through a bear market.”

Volumes at cryptocurrency exchanges have jumped, with Coinbase, Bitstamp and Bitfinex combined seeing a 19 percent bump in 24-hour exchange volume, according to data aggregator CryptoCompare.

So, what’s the reason for the jump? Higher crypto volatility means traders are seeing more opportunities to make money.

“It appears that volatility play-related profit-taking and some degree of normalization of liquidity is behind the pick up in prices,” said Denis Vinokourov of Bequant, London-based London-based digital asset firm Bequant.

Trading on Bitfinex began pricing bitcoin at a discount after 09:00 UTC, sometimes by as much as $20 lower when compared to exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitstamp. This allows for traders to buy bitcoin on the cheaper exchange (Bitfinex, for example) and simultaneously sell where prices are higher in an arbitrage, a near-riskless profit.

The discrepancy narrowed, then continued again after 17:00 UTC, with spreads hitting over $30 at times.

It’s not just on Bitfinex where traders are finding opportunities. BitMEX’s perpetual contracts on bitcoin settle every eight hours and are currently paying those who buy them as much as 8 basis points (0.008 percent) of value. Traders can thus buy bitcoin perpetual futures on BitMEX and sell simultaneously in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and collect the basis payments. BitMEX allows traders to leverage as much as 100 times over what they put up.

“We are seeing most of our selling flow from basis trades, not liquidating trades,” said David Vizsolyi, Head of Trading at Chicago-based DV Chain.

Ether (ETH) was briefly down compared to bitcoin, as the BTC/ETH pair on exchanges like Coinbase showed ether priced in bitcoin moving below its 10-day moving average at around 17:00 UTC. This signals that traders were also selling ether and buying bitcoin, even though the prices of both assets were going up.

That move was short-lived. Within the same hour, the trend turned around, with ether later seeing stronger gains over bitcoin. At press time, ether is up 19 percent in 24 hours.

Elsewhere, the foreign exchange markets have been in turmoil, causing the dollar to strengthen against other fiat currencies. The S&P 500 squeaked out a half-percent gain while gold was up just 0.2 percent as of Thursday 20:00 UTC.","After three weeks of listening, recording and talking bitcoin (BTC) in Africa, podcaster Anita Posch shares her experiences in part one of this new six-part documentary podcast series.

“I wanted to see by myself if this is true and how far bitcoin is known and used there,” said Anita Posch.

Recorded February 2020 in the run-up to the growing quarantine movement and coronavirus travel restrictions, Anita traveled to Zimbabwe and Botswana to listen, learn and record about the usage of bitcoin in these countries. In the world of bitcoin, countries like Zimbabwe and Venezuela are frequently mentioned as places where the cryptocurrency could or perhaps should be making a difference and where they can really help the people’s economic situations.

TRANSCRIPT: “Bitcoin in Africa: The Ubuntu Way” – Part 1 – Zimbabwe: Ideal conditions for Bitcoin?

ANITA

Hello friends, bitcoiners and pre-coiners alike! This is the first episode of a multipart series called “Bitcoin in Africa: The Ubuntu Way”

In February 2020 I travelled to Zimbabwe and Botswana to find out, if and how bitcoin (BTC) is used there. I spent three weeks in Zimbabwe, two weeks of that time I was in Harare the capital and I travelled for one week to Bulawayo and Victoria Falls. After that I spent some days in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana to meet and talk with the founder of the Satoshicentre, Alakanani Itireleng.

The instrument you heard is a mbira (pronounced m-BEER-ra , IPA (ə)mˈbɪəɾə) it is an African musical instrument, traditional to the Shona people of Zimbabwe.

By Alex Weeks at the English language Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0

Why did I visit Zimbabwe?

I wanted to see with my own eyes how the living situation is for people and, more importantly, to research the usage of bitcoin. Bitcoin is in my eyes first and foremost not a speculative, trading object, where everything is about price. For me it’s a tool of liberation that enables individuals and communities to free themselves of tight restrictions by authoritarian or totalitarian nation states that harm people’s human rights. This has many faces. In the so-called western world, in countries with freedom of speech, safety and a high level of wealth, it is the possibility to free oneself from the banking system. The banking system has in the last 30 years in combination with national and global regulations evolved into a very strict system of surveillance and allowances. Where we – the majority people of integrity are being policed by the banks – because of fear of money laundering and terrorism finance done by the few. In conjunction with “surveillance capitalism” – a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff in her book, well worth reading – surveillance capitalism – which is the permanent recording of all our digital traces on Facebook, Google and Co. – that are being used not only to comfort us with better search results and convenience, but also to manipulate our decisions and extort our data for money and higher profits. This has had disastrous consequences for democracy, freedom and our privacy. So in countries with high living standards, safety and a relatively good working banking system with a low inflation rate controlled by so called “independent” central banks, I would argue that governments try to regulate bitcoin in the face of “money laundering and financing terrorism” – while in countries like Zimbabwe bitcoin has to be tamed or controlled by the governing elite, because of the possibility for more “human rights and freedom” for its citizens and their loss of power.

This podcast special and my trip to Africa would not have been possible without my sponsors and supporters.

I want to thank my sponsors first: Thank you: Peter McCormack and the whatbitcoindid podcast, Coinfinity and the CardWallet, LocalBitcoins.com a person-to-person bitcoin trading site, SHIFT Cryptosecurity, manufacturer of the hardware wallet BitBox02, and many thanks to several unknown private donors who sent me Satoshis over the lightning network.

This special is edited by CoinDesk’s Podcasts Editor Adam B. Levine and published first on the CoinDesk Podcast Network. Thank you very much for supporting the Bitcoin in Africa series with your work.

Thanks goes also out to stakwork.com – stakwork is a great project that brings bitcoin into the world through earning. One can do microjobs on stakwork, earning Satoshis and cash them out without even having an understanding about the lightning network or bitcoin. I think we need more projects like that to spread the usage of bitcoin around the world.

Thank you also to GoTenna, for donating several gotenna devices to set up a mesh network in Zimbabwe and to Team Satoshi, the decentralized sports team for supporting my work.

This special is also brought to you by the Let’s Talk Bitcoin Network.

Voice of captain: Mascati…. Welcome on board… Make yourself comfortable….

ANITA:

I did talks about bitcoin in both countries and introduced around 100 people to the possibilities of using and earning bitcoin and showed them how it can improve their living situation in the short and long run.

I met with many people from different backgrounds with a diverse set of goals and interests. I talked with them about their daily life, how the economic situation has changed in the last 20 to 40 years, about their hopes and fears for the future and, of course, about bitcoin and its chances and challenges in Africa. In 2014 Alakanani Itireleng a true Bitcoin OG founded the Satoshicentre in Gaborone to educate her fellow citizens about bitcoin:

INTERVIEWEE: “I want to help people get into the Bitcoin ecosystem and set the ecosystem to make it like work for Africa, not only for Botswana to make it to work for for Africa, you know, we are the very people that need bitcoin. Yeah.

We are the people. I think so too. Yeah, we are actually this is the place where it is needed the most. Like I was shocked when I was in the U.S. in Orange County [California]. I saw a drive-through bank. Yeah. I was like why do you guys have a drive through banks? You don’t need bitcoin. So we need bitcoin.”

ANITA

February 2020: My trip to Zimbabwe starts. I arrive at Harare airport – before I am allowed to join the queue in front of the immigration desk my body temperature is measured – it is coronavirus season. All is good. They ask me where I come from: I say Austria. The answer is a question: Australia? I say no: Austria in Europe, next to Germany. Ah. Austria. Alright. I join the queue for the immigration procedure. I apply for a visa – and pay 30 U.S. dollar in cash. This, despite the fact, that in June 2019 the use of U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies was outlawed by the government.

So, if the government outlawed the use of foreign currencies, why did I just pay my visa fees with U.S. dollar cash? This is just one of many questions I ask myself during the three weeks of my stay in Zimbabwe.

Next step, customs control: I am very nervous because my suitcase is packed with devices for bitcoin use. I am bringing donations from my sponsors, several Hardware wallets, the BitBox02 by SHIFT cryptosecurity, several Card Wallets, a RaspiBlitz, which is a Bitcoin and Lightning Fullnode and several GoTenna devices to set up a mesh network to communicate and even send bitcoin, while being off the grid. So coming from the immigration desk I try to stay behind a couple to sneak through and I am lucky, the custom officers are not interested in me or my suitcase. I feel a great relief.

After arrival my friends immediately take me out to an event. They say, you have to see that. And they were right.

It was the Austrian new year’s concert in Harare. It felt a little weird. Being in a church, with an audience of 99 percent whites – so called “Murungus” in the local Shona language – attending. A group of elderly Rhodesians coming together to listen to a classical concert in the tradition of Vienna philharmonic orchestra. That’s not quite what I expected to find. But this audience is also a part of the country’s history and current life. This shows that Zimbabwe is a land of many contrasts.

In the three weeks of my stay, I showered exactly one time. Bah, you might think. No, I did wash myself, but only in a so-called shallow bath. You fill the bathtub just a little bit, like 2 cm high and then you wash yourself sitting and pouring the water over yourself with a jug. Why? Because of the water drought, there is no public water supply. So people try to save as much water as possible, you don’t even flush the toilet when you have been on the small side. You have to buy water privately that is delivered every two weeks with a truck. And if possible, you collect the rainwater. Even though there is no water supply the water company still sends bills and you have to pay them.

Same with electricity: It depends in which area you live. If you are close to hospitals or to the areas where people from the government live, then your chances to have water and electricity all the time are high. If not, then you have to suffer from power outages. At the place where I was staying, the power went on around 11 p.m. and went off around 5 a.m. in the morning. That means that people – and there are a lot of them – who cannot afford to buy a solar panel and an inverter – have to work by night. If you cannot afford a gas stove, you have to cook by night. And still: the electricity provider ZESA sends you bills and you have to pay them.

So I travelled the country and arranged a number of interviews. Three of my interview partners in Zimbabwe wanted to stay anonymous. One person is working for a human rights organization in Harare. Another one feared about his professional career and the third one is a teacher in a public school who is also afraid of possible threats. The other two I was talking with would have been ok with their names in the public, but I decided to leave their names out, too. Why? Because people are scared. As my interview partner who is working for a human rights organization puts it:

HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKER

“The human rights situation here right now is really poor. I don’t, I haven’t I haven’t been this pessimistic about it in 10 to 15 years. It’s really is … it’s as repressive as it has been with like, an added layer of like a sinister, vindictive.

And I think that there’s a small number of activists or organizations trying to do something. And in some ways, because there’s so few of them, it’s really easy to just sit really hard. So if you are one of those handful of people you can get kidnapped, raped, beaten up and stuff. You know, you fight [for your] life, you know, every day.

And like, how long does the energy last? So because some people, I mean, that’s my observation on my feet, you know, just that you can do it for a certain period of time. And then you just, I don’t know, it’s almost like a, like a fading out, you know?”

ANITA

So one can say there’s no free speech in this country?

HR SPEAKER

Yeah. And adding up … Especially what you receive from a kind of like whatever in form of like a global support network coverage of it’s very poor, you know? I mean, you get a headline in the media and like this, and this happens, but actually, the peer support internationally, I also like find quite poor.

ANITA

One of my interviews was taking place at a self-service restaurant in the middle of Harare. My guest and I started talking and I recorded with my audio recorder and two handheld microphones. After 20 minutes a woman from the restaurant approached us:

UNKNOWN SPEAKER:

….recording is not allowed….

ANITA

We continued and finished our interview and left for another restaurant. But this was a disturbing experience. At least for me. I am used to being able to record my own conversations wherever I want. But people here are scared. And as I realized afterwards reports from foreigners about Zimbabwe require a permit. Also, you are not allowed to take pictures of government buildings.

With all those complicated living conditions, what are the positives about living in Zimbabwe?

HR SPEAKER

The people, the people, people it is and yeah, the climate. And the possibilities. You know, if you are an entrepreneurial person you are very free to start new things – there are not so many strict regulations for starting a business. In fact, you have to have this self-sovereign attitude otherwise you couldn’t survive here. Still, it is very different, if you have the possibility to leave the country or not.

Because It’s tough. I mean, I think that’s a big part of why people leave, is the combination of kind of lack of civic freedom and lack of economic prospects. And it’s a little bit like what we were just saying about the colleague who’s gone to work in London, like you had an opportunity like that, you take it and if you mean, even if, even if the choice was like, be a tomato vendor here or work as a waiter in South Africa, I’ll work as a waiter in South Africa or for any other foreign currency I can send it home. I can support my family.

ANITA:

There are 16 million people living in Zimbabwe and only about 800,000 of them have a formal employment. That are only 5 percent of the population, that means 95 percent are informally unemployed; they hustle, they live off nothing. Of the 5 percent with a formal employment, most of them work for the government, are civil servants or teachers in public schools.

This is what the headmistress of a school told me:

TEACHER:

“And everybody else is just living [by] hustling. Yeah, we hustle. Oh, yeah, it’s … you have people who work but and who are self-employed. But very few people are, like, working … for a proper institution, because even the institutions are in a difficult place because you’ll have rentals, for example, charged in U.S. dollars, even though the government would say no, it’s not allowed. Even if they rate it, it will be like astronomical prices. We, like, I don’t even earn that much.

So typical rental, for example, for a one-bedroom apartment, let’s call it that, which is pretty standard, you’re looking at about 250 to 350 U.S. dollars, the average person at most is maybe earning 2,500 Zim dollars, which is about 100 dollars. So how do you pay your rent?… [S]o now like it’s become, employment has almost become like a jail, because it’s, like, because now you don’t have time, because they’ll take all your time, you don’t have time to find that additional $200 or $250 to pay your rent. But, really and truly, you need additional maybe $400 because you’ve got the other bills outside of rent.

So it’s almost like being employed, is almost a disadvantage … in this country because you’re locked down at that price and even if everything goes up, every month, your salary will remain the same. And a lot of companies struggle to put – what did they call it? Something allowance of, forgetting the term – an adjustment, as, yeah, it’s called a salary adjustment to move with the market. It’s never really completely what you actually need. They’ll try maybe you get an extra 200 bond or an extra 500 bond. But it’s difficult, you know, it’s difficult to keep up with that corporate struggling as well. Very few corporates are able to pay people very well for it to make sense.”

As a teacher and headmistress. she can tell about the situation in schools:

Wow, I mean, I work in education. I work in education, and I can tell you, it’s difficult. It’s difficult. Have a staff complement of 14 and they, my, you have to then obviously get money from school fees. So you have a lot of schools now. Trying to diversify. Because if you put all that pressure on the parents, then your parents can’t afford to send their children to your school. So it’s like, Okay, what do you do? We need to increase our fees because I need to be able to pay my teachers more. But if I throw that burden on the parents, I, as a parent know that I can’t even afford that, you know, per term for every child, that I’ve got some parents of two, three, four children, and they need to bring [their] children, so what do you do? You end up subsidizing? That’s when you have schools that have maybe a little Market Garden, you know, where you commercialize your kitchen and you start baking. You know, when you’re not making lunch for the kids, you’re selling food on the side so that you supplement your income. It is difficult and teachers have struggled the most, especially who work for state schools, public schools, they are in the worst possible position. Those who work in private schools are in a much better position because they can afford to charge more government schools can’t charge what private schools are charging, because government schools supposed to the public schools supposed to be affordable for anyone to send their child to school, then they put in a difficult position where you’re told you cannot not accept a child because they haven’t paid fees. So you have to accept them.

So you’ll have, let’s say, 50 children, and maybe only 15 of them have paid the school fees. But because as a government school, you’re not allowed to send children home because they have a right to education. How do you take care of the other 35 … and still take care of your teachers and it’s, it’s our country, is madness, you know. The more I talk about it, you know, it sounds terrible.

ANITA

Not only that prices are rising daily, the whole society is crippled by corruption. Before 2017, when Robert Mugabe still was the country’s leader, there were roadblocks by police everywhere. They would stop your car and say that you have done something wrong or mock you about small things they find in your car – ending with demanding money. Friends told me that they stopped driving through the city of Harare, because at one time they were stopped by five roadblocks inside the city and had to pay around 100 USD in fines only to get from one side of town to the other. With the new government, this has changed. No more roadblocks inside Harare. When I was there, it was almost spooky. Because I did not see any police. A friend said: If you need the police at your home, because something has happened, you cannot just call them and they’ll come, you have to go and fetch them.

And still there are roadblocks. A thing that I have never encountered in my life before: when we were on our roadtrip to Victoria Falls, we were stopped by roadblocks at the borders of each city. Coming from Austria, I have never seen something like that before. And it feels creepy. It’s like, every time I see police and I have to stop – or maybe they wave us through, you never know – it feels like you have done something wrong. Uncertainty, being at the mercy of their whims – that’s not a good feeling.

INTERVIEWEE 2:

As any person I hate talking ill about my country, but it’s the truth, sadly, sadly is the truth. We are struggling. We are struggling. We have doctors are not paid nearly what a doctor should be paid realistically. We don’t have equipment. We don’t have the right medication the cost of medication alone is unbelievable. You can’t afford to get sick. We were in a fuel queue with car behind us was a doctor, a doctor was in there. And he eventually was he was actually a doctor on call. And he’d also been in this queue for like, two hours or so. And the guy was supposed to be on call and knowing already that [office] was so severely understaffed. A doctor who supposed to be attending to patients but is stuck in a fuel queue is a problem. So he went up to the front and he tried to get fuel, at least in a jerrycan, and he showed them his card and the fact that he was on coal and it was a huge fight. But I think in the end, he only got like 10 liters, which is enough just to get him to work and get back home at the end of it. And as we’re trying to help him sort of fill up his car. He then says, As a doctor, I can safely say to you cannot afford to get sick. Please do not get sick in this country because it’s one of two things: It’s either you cannot afford it because they are hospitals that are beautifully equipped, fully staffed, all the medication, all these hospitals are here right now in this country, but you know you are paying a premium for it. Even our medical aides, not all of them are accepted at these hospitals. But then you have our government hospitals, which are not as well equipped. And if you don’t have the kind of money that is required to get proper health care, your chances of not making it or you know, probably not getting the best health care you possibly could a very, very high, very high and if a doctor can say, don’t get sick, what does that what does that tell you?

ANITA:

While traveling from Harare to Bulawayo I met a doctor who lived a big part of his life in Zimbabwe. I would say, he is in his early 70s and he fought in the Rhodesian Bush War, which was a guerilla war to fight for the independence of Zimbabwe in the 1970s. It ended with the declaration of independence of Zimbabwe in 1980 with a new leader called Robert Mugabe. This doctor lives in Europe now, but every year he returns to his old home country to stay for some weeks. He brought a suitcase full of medical supplies with him, to donate it to a hospital, because public hospitals are lacking everything. At the airport, custom officers opened his suitcase and demanded money for the supplies.

ANITA:

Corruption is everywhere. And it seems that there are different rules for different people. Yes, I think one can say that for every country, but the differences are so big here. If you have USD, if you are in a high position, if you are in the right network, you can have a great life in Zimbabwe. I have seen private houses with swimming pools blue as the sky, many shiny SUVs and most of the better off people employ gardeners, maids and other staff.

When I was there a new rule by the government was published. The minimum wage for a gardener or worker is allowed to be as little as eight USD. Per month. And of course: this is not paid in USD, but in Zimbabwe dollar.

For instance: The maid in a house – close to where I stayed – works seven days a week, from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., doing housework, cooking, taking care of the kids. She is a so-called live-in maid. Due to the power cuts she has to iron by night. She also sleeps in the house of her employer. For this, she earns 10 USD per month. Most of the time the families of workers like her live in another part of town, where the rents are cheaper. So, because they cannot afford a car, if they want to go home, they have to take the bus which costs them around 1-2 USD. How should anyone be able to live from that?

I could go on with these examples of mismanagement and corruption. For instance: MealieMeal – which is like a cornmeal- it is the Zimbabweans staple diet… The thing people eat on a daily basis like rice in Asia, noodles in Italy or potatoes in Germany. It’s part of their diet and normally relatively affordable. But it is not available at the moment. The producers of MealieMeal are being forced by the government to get paid in Zimbabwe dollars. So they decided, before they are paid in this bad money that loses its value daily, they rather store the MealieMeal in their warehouses and wait for better deals. This is something that hits people in towns worse, than those in the countryside. Because there either you have your own corn or the local chief settles a deal with the producers so that his people get MealieMeal.

Anita:

And I did not even mention the fuel queues up until now. So petrol: The urban spaces in Harare, Bulawayo and other towns are not densely populated in general. That means, that distances are very great. And there is no public transport like we know it.

Provided by Anita Posch

Yes, there are a lot of mini buses and also bigger buses to travel over land. Someone like me would be completely lost because there are no timetables or stops with signs. And yeah, there are no road signs at all. Nowhere. So you really need to know your way or ask people. That means everything is depending on cars and buses. If you cannot afford that, you have to walk. And I saw a lot of people walking. Women, who were carrying heavy bags on their heads – yes like we see it on television – and men, who interestingly enough, carry much less than their accompanying women. And yes, I have asked. It is a very patriarchal society.

Coming back to the petrol.

Provided by Anita Posch

There are severe petrol shortages. You never know when and where you can get petrol. I was told that most of the time, when fuel shortages occurred, the price was raised afterwards. In the weeks I was in the country, I saw many, many people queueing for petrol. Long lines of cars are parked at the side of the streets waiting for the petrol station to open. People spend nights and days queueing, never knowing for how long the petrol will last. One of my interview partners excused himself for not calling me at the time we agreed upon because he was in the petrol queue for such a long time that he did not have power anymore in his cell phone.

Before we dive deeper into the current situation in the following episodes, let’s take a look back and take a look into the history of this beautiful land Zimbabwe and its people.

The Encyclopædia Britannica begins its history of Zimbabwe with “The Stone Age”

The first Bantu people are thought to have reached Zimbabwe between the 5th and 10th centuries CE. Zimbabwe is home to many stone ruins, including those known as Great Zimbabwe, which has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986.

Overview of Great Zimbabwe. The large walled construction is the Great Enclosure. Some remains of the valley complex can be seen in front of it.

Zimbabwe, 1997. (Public domain photo by Jan Derk)

The Portuguese, who arrived on the east coast of Africa at the end of the 15th century, dreamed of opening up the interior and establishing a route to connect their eastern settlements with Angola in the west. The first European to enter Zimbabwe was probably Antonio Fernandes, who tried to cross the continent and reached the neighborhood of Que Que (now Kwekwe).

A second great movement of the Bantu peoples began in 1830, this time from the south. The Ndebele, carved out a kingdom. The Ndebele were warriors and pastoralists, in the Zulu tradition, and they mastered and dispossessed the weaker tribes, known collectively as Shona (Mashona), who were sedentary, peaceful tillers of the land.

For more than half a century, until the coming of European rule, the Ndebele continued to enslave and plunder the Shona. This is an important fact for the later development.

During this period, however, British and Afrikaner hunters, traders, and prospectors had begun to move up from the south, and with them came the missionaries.

In South Africa Cecil Rhodes formed the British South Africa Company, which received its charter in October 1889. Its objects were to extend the railway, to encourage immigration and colonization, to promote trade and commerce, and – of course – to secure all mineral rights, in return for guarantees of protection and security of rights to the tribal chiefs.

The Ndebele resented this European invasion and in 1893 they took up arms, being defeated only after months of strenuous fighting. The Shona had at first accepted the Europeans, but they too became rebellious, and the whole country was not pacified until 1897.

By 1892 about 1,500 settlers from the south had arrived in Rhodesia. The railway reached Bulawayo in 1896 and Victoria Falls in 1904. After Cecil Rhodes’s death in 1902 he was buried in the Matopos Hills and they built him a monument that stands on top of these hills destroying the beauty of the land.

In 1922 – British South Africa Company administration ended, the white minority opts for self-government.

1930 – Land Apportionment Act restricts black access to land, forcing many people into wage labour. Between 1930-1960s – Black opposition to colonial rule was growing.

1965 – Prime minister Ian Smith unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom under white minority rule, sparking international outrage and economic sanctions.

The Rhodesian Bush War lasted from 1972 to 1979 it was a Guerrilla war against white rule.

According to Rhodesian government statistics, more than 20,000 people were killed during the war. Rhodesian security forces, guerrillas and around 8.000 black civilians, and 500 white civilians were killed.

In 1980 – Zanu leader Robert Mugabe won independence elections. He became the first prime minister as Zimbabwe achieved an internationally recognized independence on April 18, 1980.

He stayed president of Zimbabwe until 2017.

Mugabe was born to a poor Shona family – hence remember how the Ndebele enslaved and plundered the Shona, before the European rule.

Because between 1982 and 1985, Mugabe sent the military and the so called 5th brigade – trained by North Korean – to crush armed resistance against him from Ndebele groups – in a military crackdown known as Gukurahundi, a Shona term which translates roughly to mean “the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains”. The Gukurahundi campaigns were also known as the Matabeleland Massacres. Approximately 20,000 Matabele were murdered in these first years after the war; most of those killed were victims of public executions.

Margaret Thatcher’s U.K. government was aware of the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger Mugabe and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans. The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President Ronald Reagan welcoming Mugabe to the White House in September 1983. In October 1983, Mugabe attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi, where no participating states mentioned the Gukurahundi.

Economically, Southern Rhodesia developed an economy that was narrowly based on production of a few primary products, notably, chrome and tobacco. It was therefore vulnerable to the economic cycle. The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom. This boom prompted the immigration of about 200,000 whites between 1945 and 1970, taking the white population up to 307,000. They established a relatively balanced economy, transforming what was once a primary producer dependent on backwoods farming into an industrial giant which spawned a strong manufacturing sector, iron and steel industries, and modern mining ventures. These economic successes owed little to foreign aid.

In the 1990s hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the U.K. government – which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution – halted its payments.

Over the course of the 1990s, Zimbabwe’s economy steadily deteriorated. By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled. By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50 percent. As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans – the greater part of the nation’s skilled workforce – had left the country. Mugabe increasingly blamed the country’s economic problems on Western nations and the white Zimbabwean minority, who still controlled most of its commercial agriculture, mines, and manufacturing industry.

From a human rights perspective I also want to talk about Mugabe’s growing preoccupation with homosexuality, lambasting it as an “un-African” import from Europe. He described gay people as being “guilty of sub-human behavior”, and of being “worse than dogs and pigs”. This attitude may have stemmed in part from his strong conservative values, but it was strengthened by the fact that several ministers in the British government were gay. Mugabe began to believe that there was a “gay mafia” and that all of his critics were homosexuals. Critics also accused Mugabe of using homophobia to distract attention from the country’s problems.

In February 2000, land invasions began as armed gangs attacked and occupied white-owned farms. The farm seizures were often violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, with many of their employees experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their lack of access to fertilizer.

The farm invasions severely impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe had produced over two million tons of maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000. By 2009, 75 percent of Zimbabwe’s population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. Hyperinflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600 percent. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000 percent and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.

The country’s lucrative tourist industry was decimated, and there was a rise in poaching, including of endangered species. Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem when he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.

In 2008, the parliamentary and presidential elections were held. After the election, Mugabe’s government deployed its ‘war veterans’ in a violent campaign against his opponent Tsvangirai supporters. Between March and June 2008, at least 153 MDC supporters were killed. There were reports of women affiliated with the MDC being subjected to gang rape by Mugabe supporters. Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans were internally displaced by the violence. These actions brought international condemnation of Mugabe’s government.

This is only 12 years ago. No wonder that people are scared.

In 2009, Mugabe’s government declared that – to combat rampant inflation – it would recognize U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency. This helped to stabilize prices. But then in November 2016 a new national currency called bond notes was introduced amid public resistance.

In 2017 Mr. Mugabe resigns after the military takes control. Former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa becomes president.

People have hope that from now on Zimbabwe might become a better place. But as it seems, nothing really has changed.

In January 2019, protests break out in major cities after the government more than doubles fuel prices in an attempt to tackle shortages and the black market.

In June 2019, Zimbabwe outlaws the use of any other foreign currency. Only Zimbabwean dollars are allowed as legal tender.

That meant that All USD one had held on a bank account in the country were changed into Zimbabwe dollar at the exchange rate of 1:1. This did not last long. Today – 9 months afterwards – the exchange rate on the streets is 1:43. So now 43 Zim Dollar are equivalent to 1 US Dollar.

INTERVIEW:

When I came here two and a half weeks ago, I think the official exchange rate was one to 17. And in the shops, we had one to 20 or 25. Today, we got one to 30 in a shop. While so in, yeah, in two and a half weeks, the rtgs or the bond, Zimbabwe bond lost a lot. I don’t know how many percent that exactly now, but actually a lot of, yes, value. Yeah. So what do you see? Or what do you think is coming next? I mean, do you think you’re going into hyperinflation again?

Speaker 2

We are in hyperinflation.

Anita Posch

You are still in again? Yes.

Speaker 2

Yeah. I think we are. It’s just that it’s not. It’s not on the scale where last time we just like I feel like it just ran out of people’s hands, like when we will became trillionaires. And quadrillion is like … [it’s] just there was no control left, like no one’s coming and no one knew how to deal with it. We’ve been there before. So now it’s like okay, let’s try and control it. But … we are currently in hyperinflation, I believe, so maybe an economist will tell me I’m wrong.

Anita:

In the three weeks of my stay the exchange rate on the street went from 1:20 to 1:30. This is a huge change. This is a sad situation because for the people living is getting difficult again.

And by the way: The Reserve bank of Zimbabwe maintains a Twitter account, where you can find tweets that paint a picture about what is happening in the country.

For instance, one tweet is threatening people with disciplinary measures for posting pictures of new banknotes on social media!

In the next episode you will hear more about the banking situation and how people here are used to living in a multicurrency system, which theoretically is a perfect starting point for people to adopt bitcoin.

Thanks for listening.","Much to the disappointment of true believers, however, Bitcoin—in fact, the whole cryptocurrency market—has cratered right along with the stock market. Though the price has jumped today, at publication time it was still down roughly 40% from a month ago. So is Bitcoin not actually a safe haven after all? Though it appears to have failed the biggest test of the idea yet, the debate will probably rage on, serving as a reminder that we are still figuring out exactly what Bitcoin is and is not.

It’s also not clear that Bitcoin is supposed to be anything in particular. But Satoshi Nakamoto, its pseudonymous, still-unknown creator, did leave some clues. The title of Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper, which introduced the concept to the world, refers to “peer-to-peer electronic cash.” In the introduction, Nakamoto called for an alternative to the traditional system of online commerce, which relies too heavily on “trusted third parties.”

Then there is the mysterious message Bitcoin’s creator left in the very first record of transactions in the blockchain, known as the genesis block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of a second bailout for banks.” Nakamoto never explained what this message meant. Still, it’s hard not to see Bitcoin as a reaction to the last global financial meltdown, which began in September of 2008. The Bitcoin white paper hit a popular cryptography email list on Halloween of that year, and the system was running by January.

In practice, Bitcoin is too slow and inefficient to act like electronic cash. Instead, many enthusiasts today view it as a form of “digital gold.” Real gold has long been considered a reliable store of value, and investors tend to see it as a form of insurance against an economic downturn.

Gold is also famously seen as a “safe haven” asset, which Investopedia defines as “an investment that is expected to retain or increase in value during times of market turbulence.” Other commodities like silver, corn, and livestock can also be safe havens. So are US Treasury bonds and cash. Many Bitcoin advocates have claimed that the digital asset belongs in this league too. Then last week happened.

“Surprised we’re seeing the Bitcoin price fall in this environment, would have expected the opposite,” Brian Armstrong, CEO of the popular US exchange Coinbase, tweeted on March 9, likely expressing what many Bitcoin fans were feeling. And that was before the carnage of March 12, when Bitcoin lost more than 40% of its value.

So what happened? One part of the explanation is somewhat ironic. In its earlier days, most of the people who invested in Bitcoin were committed to building an alternative financial system. They saw it as a long-term investment. Bitcoin used to be “the asset of the future,” writes Noelle Acheson, director of research at CoinDesk. It really was separate from the traditional financial system.

But as an industry has emerged around the currency in more recent years, it has made a major effort to foster adoption by “institutional” investors like hedge funds and other professional trading desks. The recent selloff is evidence that the effort has worked. Professional traders have been desperate to raise cash, writes Acheson: “Bitcoin was just another financial asset getting trampled as investors headed for the exit.”

So in its short life, Bitcoin has gone from an extremely obscure asset held mostly by true believers to “just another financial asset.” In light of the latest global financial crisis, it looks nothing like a safe haven. But in other contexts—such as in countries with high inflation, like Venezuela—it has become a safe haven of sorts, at least compared with the national currency. And though it did crash alongside the stock market this time, Bitcoin can still be considered an “alternative asset,” in that like gold it doesn’t depend on the cash flows of other institutions for its value, writes Acheson: “The greater range of alternative assets, the better for investors, especially in troubling times like these.”

A decade from now, how different will Bitcoin look as an asset? Will it still look more like digital gold than digital cash? Who will be investing in it, and why? What Bitcoin is is bound to keep changing along with those factors. So are ideas about the role it can play for investors and in society, “safe haven” or not.",

After a quick rise over $6,900 Friday, bitcoin's technical charts are calling a continued rally.

Fundamentals also support further gains, according to analysts.

A failure to keep prices above key support near $6,400 would weaken the immediate bullish case and allow a pullback to $6,000.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price recovery gathered pace on Friday, helping the cryptocurrency erase a significant chunk of the recent drop.

The top cryptocurrency by market value jumped to an eight-day high of $6,943 at 10:30 UTC, having started rising from $5,400 Thursday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

The solid gains have seen bitcoin claw back a hefty 46 percent of the drop from $10,500 to $3,867 witnessed in the four weeks to March 13. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $6,865, a 27 percent gain on a week-to-date basis.

The rebound seen in the last 36 hours had been expected, with technical charts reporting seller exhaustion. The cryptocurrency had also been looking undervalued as per the market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score.

The cryptocurrency still looks underpriced at press time, with the Z-score hovering below zero, according to Glassnode data. That bodes well for a continued rally.

Meanwhile, speculators may put a bid under BTC in anticipation of a big buy order, as Tether, the company behind the tether (USDT) stablecoin, has minted over $120 million worth of the coins in the last 48 hours, according to Simon Peters, crypto market analyst at investment platform eToro.

The fundamentals are looking better, too, with fiscal authorities across the globe injecting massive amounts of liquidity to counter the coronavirus-led slowdown in economic activity.

The U.S. Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased to a record high $4.7 trillion this week. The U.S. central bank also cut rates to zero on Sunday, having injected liquidity worth $1.5 trillion into the system last week.

“We’re going to be in a period of zero rates for a long time. We could see bitcoin act as a global inflation hedge due to many aggressive stimulus packages being implemented,” Richard Rosenblum, co-head of trading at crypto liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.

What’s more, the traditional markets are showing signs of stability. The major European equity market indices are flashing green for the second consecutive day and futures tied to the S&P 500 are up 4.45 percent.

That could invite stronger buying pressure for bitcoin. Ever since the global market shakeout, the cryptocurrency has been moving strongly in tandem with the equities market.

The technical charts, too, suggest scope for a continuation of the recovery rally.

Hourly chart

The ascending triangle breakout at 09:00 UTC was backed by an uptick in trading volumes and has put the bulls back in the driver’s seat.

The cryptocurrency could soon challenge resistance at $7,000. A violation there would open the doors to $7,400.

If prices fail to keep gains above the support at $6,425 (December 2019 low), the bearish divergence (lower high) of the relative strength index (RSI) would gain credence and a pullback to $6,000 could be seen.

Daily chart

The daily MACD histogram continues to produce higher lows below the zero line, indicating dropping bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the five- and 10-day averages are teasing a bullish crossover.

The

relative strength index has violated the descending trendline in favor of the

bulls.

All in all, the daily chart indicators are calling for further gains. However, the cryptocurrency is not out of the woods yet, eToro’s Simon Peters told CoinDesk, while adding that bitcoin needs to print more prominent higher highs and higher lows to give us more confidence.

Essentially, Peters wants to see if there is a dip in demand, which would create a higher low.","Crypto hedge fund Adaptive Capital is shutting down, The Block has learned.

In an investor letter reviewed by The Block, Adaptive said that it plans to return remaining capital to its Limited Partners following a steep drop in bitcoin's price during the March 12-13 trading session.

""Adaptive has made the decision to close operations and return the remaining funds to investors,"" the firm wrote. ""We are convinced that the risks of continuing operations in such an unstable environment outweigh the potential benefits.""

The price of bitcoin fell by more than $1,000 on March 13, following a period of relative calm for the digital asset compared to the U.S. stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had been in free-fall mode since the beginning of the month.

Adaptive blamed ""infrastructural insufficiencies"" for its inability to respond properly to the sell-off. BitMEX, which isn't named in the letter, went out of service for about 45-minutes during the price-plunge. BitMEX said it had a ""hardware issue"" with its cloud service provider, which caused requests to be delayed between 02:16 and 02:40 UTC. Normal service resumed at 03:00 UTC, it added. Sources told The Block that Adaptive maintained accounts on BitMEX, which were liquidated.

""A number of respectable exchanges, platforms, and tools that we use daily have halted their operations during the selloff significantly hindering our ability to act accordingly,"" Adaptive said in the letter.

Two sources familiar with Adaptive's business told The Block that the firm came out of the drawdown down more than 50%. That's an eye-popping number, considering Adaptive was reported to be up 552.77% from October 3, 2018, through May 3, 2019, according to a pitch deck reviewed by The Block.

The firm made one bullish call in 2018 on December 7, according to the deck. Bitcoin's value is up more than 50% since that date.

The firm tied its ability to time the market to its proprietary indicators built on data ""pertaining to the majority of the largest blockchain networks in real-time,"" according to the deck.

The firm is led by Murad Mahmudov, a Princeton University-graduate who had brief stints at Glencore and Goldman Sachs. He maintains a significant following in crypto social media circles, with more than 70,000 followers on Twitter.

Mahmudov did not respond to an emailed request for comment by press time.

In U.S. equities, hedge funds have experienced similar woes as the number of opportunities for an outsized return continues to shrink. $160 billion Bridgewater Associates is one notable victim of the coronavirus-linked market turmoil. According to an investor letter reviewed by The Block, the net performance of its ""All Weather"" and Pure ""Alpha Funds"" are down on a net basis. Its Pure Alpha (18% vol) fund leads in losses, down ~21%, according to the document.","Banco Sella, an Italian bank, has recently launched Bitcoin trading services for citizens of the COVID-19 gripped country.

Per the official announcement, the bank is offering the digital currency trading services on its Hype platform, and itself is acting as an intermediary to mitigate any risks associated with the crypto exchange.

Capitalizing on the crisis?

The move comes at a time when Italy is under lockdown due to the major outbreak of the coronavirus in the country.

The bank believes that the country’s citizens being stuck in their homes are showing a growing interest in digital currencies. With the plummet of global stock markets, investments in digital assets seem to be a better option to many, but the volatile market has risks of its own.

Banco Sella’s services were introduced to its 1.2 million customer base on Hype, which will also be able to spend the digital currency in making transactions.

Hype already offers trading facilities with financial instruments including derivatives and contract-for-difference (CFD).

Mentioning the move, Antonio Valitutti, General Manager at Hype said: “The cryptocurrency and Bitcoin market in particular continues to arouse interest, especially among the public that constitutes our customer base — by definition young and smart and who, increasingly, expect to be able to access this world through the tool that they use to manage money on a daily basis.”

The platform also supports the linking of multiple bank accounts, enabling its users to purchase Bitcoins directly from the accounts. Notably, Hype has kept the service free, charging only a 1 percent transaction fee.

The bank also put a daily purchase limit of 500 euros (around $536) and an annual limit of $2,500 (almost $2,680). The premium clients of the platform, however, can purchase 4,990 euros (around $5350) worth Bitcoins per day while the annual limit is kept at 50,000 euros ($53,611).","Spencer Dinwiddie, the Brooklyn Nets guard who launched his own tokenization platform, has launched an interest-bearing stablecoin service in partnership with crypto lending firm Cred.

The new service launched Friday on Dinwiddie’s personal website. There, visitors can “pledge” TrueUSD and UPUSD stablecoins as well as bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH), earning up to 10 percent interest over the course of the term, according to Cred CEO Dan Schatt.

The service premieres at a somewhat awkward moment for Dinwiddie and Cred, both of whom deal in businesses acutely impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic. A starter for the Nets, Dinwiddie and his season were upended two weeks ago by the indefinite suspension of NBA play. Four of his teammates have since tested positive for COVID-19.

Cred, for its part, is a banking and financial services alternative at a time when global financial markets are in turmoil. Jobless claims for last week – a lagging economic indicator, but a telling one – have spiked more than at any point in over a decade, data from the Labor Department shows. The economic carnage is expected to worsen as the U.S. economy slams on its brakes.

Schatt said that the state of the world right now makes the Cred-Dinwiddie partnership all the more important. It’s offering users a high potential return on a volatility-free crypto asset: stablecoins backed one-to-one with dollar reserves.

“In an environment like this I think everyone is looking for that extra assurance. It just highlights the value of stablecoins,” Schatt said.

It’s also an opportunity to bring more people into the crypto fold, he said. Dinwiddie is the NBA’s most outspoken cryptocurrency and DeFi enthusiast, a title earned over months of fighting to tokenize his three-year, $35 million contract.

“Spencer is a fantastic spokesperson for what’s happening with blockchain and bitcoin – he’s really a thought leader in the sports industry,” Schatt said.","SAN FRANCISCO (CN) – Investors dissatisfied with the blockchain platform Tezos moved Friday to settle a raft of lawsuits against the company and its co-founders for $25 million.

The money purports to resolve all pending litigation against Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, their company Dynamic Ledger Solutions, and Tezos Stiftung (Tezos Foundation), a Switzerland-based nonprofit that controls the money.

In the summer of 2017, the Breitmans raised the equivalent of $232 million from investors for Tezos, a virtual ledger (blockchain) that keeps track of a digital currency called “tez,” “tezzie,” or “tokens.”

Investors purchased tokens using bitcoin and Ethereum – a crowdfunding method known as an “initial coin offering.”

In October 2017, a media outlet reported on rumored infighting between the Breitmans and Tezos Foundation president Johann Gevers. Tezos oversaw the fundraiser.

Investors began to fear that the blockchain project would be delayed and that they might not reap as much of the profits as they expected. There was also a misunderstanding over whether the initial coin offering (ICO) was an investment or a donation.

The Breitmans claimed the ICO was not an investment scheme and that they have no obligation to provide Tezos tokens to contributors.

But the funders countered their contributions were investments that required the defendants to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before accepting money.

They also wanted their bitcoin and Ethereum back.

Four class actions were filed and later consolidated, and negotiations for a settlement started at the end of 2018.

One major sticking point was what, if any, damages the Tezos funders could recover given the unpredictable value of cryptocurrency.

“In particular, plaintiffs were aware that defendants would argue, for instance, that the transactions at issue did not involve ‘securities’ as defined under the federal securities laws, and that such transactions were otherwise exempt from registration,” the settlement motion says. “Plaintiffs were also aware that the value of the blockchain assets at issue could rapidly fluctuate. Thus, plaintiffs knew that, even if they were successful, even after trial and appeals, they might actually recover substantially less than the amount obtained in this settlement for the benefit of the settlement class.”

The “settlement class” includes roughly 30,000 investors who participated in the ICO between July 1, 2017, and July 13, 2017. The class attorneys seek roughly $8.3 million of the $25 million in fees.

The settlement still needs to be approved by a federal judge. Lawyers for both sides did not respond to emails seeking comment Friday.","Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin by market value, is now live on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network.

Announced Thursday, Tether is using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) as the technical means to launch its tether stablecoins (USDT) on the BCH blockchain. Tether aims for the token’s price to consistently match the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 ratio and backs its value with assets.

Running directly on the BCH blockchain, SLP allows users to issue and manage tokens of various types. Tether said the launch means bitcoin.com wallet users – which supports BCH and bitcoin (BTC) – will be able to to send and receive USDT via SLP tokens, without the need for other applications.

Tether is currently live on the Algorand, EOS, Ethereum, Liquid Network, Omni and Tron blockchains with a total market capitalization – total units in circulation multiplied by spot price – of more than $5.6 billion, according to Tether Inc.’s treasury data. However, that does not seem to include any tokens on BCH as yet.

“Our latest collaboration with Bitcoin Cash will provide Tether with a variety of benefits,” said Paolo Ardoino, Tether CTO. “We expect the adoption after launch to be pretty easy for any integrator. The launch will also support more applications on the Bitcoin Cash chain, with Tether facilitating payment for these applications.”

Data aggregators such as Nomics, Messari and CoinMarketCap display differing data for Tether’s market cap.

Nick Gauthier, CTO and co-founder and Nomics, told CoinDesk the firm’s API now tracks Tether’s total liabilities. The firm is now displaying around $5.6 billion for USDT, matching Tether’s stated figure.","Today has been a great day for crypto investors, with the market posting some intense gains close on the heels of its recent capitulatory downturn seen exactly one week ago. This upswing has allowed Bitcoin to climb 17 percent, while Tezos and some other smaller altcoins have climbed 20 percent or more.

Although this price action may be emblematic of a delayed relief rally, analysts are generally anticipating Bitcoin’s current stability within the $6,000 region to give altcoins further room to rally.

Currently, Tezos is leading today’s market-wide rally, leading many analysts to note that its technical strength could allow it to climb significantly higher in the days and weeks ahead.

Crypto market rallies as bulls attempt to erase recent losses

The aggregated cryptocurrency market saw an intense rally early this morning that came about after a prolonged bout of sideways trading.

This movement was led by Bitcoin, which raced from lows of $5,100 to highs of $6,300 before finding some resistance that has since slowed its ascent.

Many altcoins rallied in tandem with Bitcoin, with Ethereum and XRP both slightly outperforming the benchmark cryptocurrency, while some smaller altcoins like Tezos have seen the largest gains today.

At the time of writing, Tezos is trading up over 22 percent at its current price of $1.68, which marks a notable climb from daily lows of $1.35 that were set prior to this morning’s rally.

This intense upwards momentum has led some analysts to grow highly bullish on the crypto, with Ledger, a highly respected analyst on Twitter, telling his followers that he is currently setting bids on Tezos, offering a chart showing a target set at roughly $2.26.

Here’s where Tezos’ key high time frame resistance lies

Ledger’s near-term price target is closely in-line with where the cryptocurrency’s strong resistance currently exists.

UB – another popular analyst and trader on Twitter – explained that he is watching for XTZ to make a move up to its high time frame resistance that currently exists right around $2.00.

“XTZ – I’m long from the EQ. Invalidation below Green. I’m looking for a move up to the highs confluent with HTF resistance. I’ll be closing the majority of my position there.”

Unless Bitcoin loses its momentum and plummets lower in the near-term, it does appear that many cryptos like Tezos may be well-positioned to see further rallies.

Revealed in RBA’s triennial Consumer Payments Survey (CPS), the findings from about 1,100 respondents shows that while consumers are largely embracing digital and alternative payment methods over cash, they’re just not paying in crypto. RBA conducted the survey in October and November 2019.

The low usage comes in spite of respondents’ overwhelming awareness that cryptocurrency can be used to pay for goods. Over 80 percent said they’d heard of crypto, making it the third-most recognized “alternative payment method” the bank surveyed for, behind only “buy now pay later” services and “tap and go” mobile payments.

Crypto was by far the least-used alternative method, falling behind those as well as AliPay and WeChat Pay, bank-owned “PayID” and “Beem It” services, and in-app mobile payment options. Crypto had the worst usage-to-awareness ratio by far, the survey showed.

“Although many respondents had heard of ‘cryptocurrencies’, very few had used a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin to actually make a consumer payment over the past year,” RBA said.

The bank has previously cast doubt on crypto’s potential to overtake existing payment rails.

This appears to be the first time that RBA’s CPS survey asked respondents about cryptocurrency. The survey had been conducted on five previous occasions.

RBA found that cash use in Australia is down in 2019, especially among younger demographics such as those under 40, who paid by cash in just 15 percent of recorded transactions. Even older groups are moving away from cash, the survey found. But it remains the most popular payment method for those 65 and up.","Bitcoin and crypto exchange company Bitfinex, announced today it will be removing 87 token trading pairs due to low levels of liquidity.

The week of March 9 was a ride regardless of what market you trade and invest in. Markets spiking up, markets spiking down, longs taking drawdowns, shorts getting stopped out on intraday bounces. While investor sentiment across markets was negative, there was also a sense of confusion as “there was nowhere to hide” in terms of assets. Interestingly, I’ve yet to speak with anyone who made a “real killing” in that week’s trading. The ones who fared best are the ones who moved out of assets and into USD/hard currency and now have many options as to where to vest that capital.

On March 12, bitcoin (BTC), having already traced down from $9,200 to $7,700 and then to $7,200 in the prior few days, plunged from $7,200 to $3,800 before spiking up and settling in the $4,800 to $5,200. The move tested the resolve of bitcoin bulls who had expected the upcoming halving to continue to drive the price higher. Similarly, sentiment towards the crypto king and leading decentralized currency plunged, with many pointing to bitcoin’s failure to be a hedge in troubled times – something that was long assumed to be a given due to the “digital gold” nature of bitcoin. I, however, believe these investors are mistaken in their analysis and the safe-haven nature of bitcoin is continuing.

Earlier that week, I wrote a short post on my thoughts around the BTC drawdown from $9,200 to $7,700. In it, I pointed out that gold prices were also taking a drawdown along with stocks and rates. My suspicion was there was some sort of liquidity crunch happening causing a cascading fire sale of assets. This more or less played out exactly as one would expect, with all markets tanking later in the week and the Federal Reserve stepping in with a liquidity injection for short-term markets. This liquidity injection included an expansion of the definition of collateral.

Repo markets: The canary in the coal mine

Having worked in both rates and equities, I’ve noticed equities traders tend to ignore moves in rates and it’s, unfortunately, a waste of a very powerful signal. Specifically, “significant” or “odd” moves in short-term markets signal shifts in the underlying liquidity needs for market participants. While repo markets have many intricacies and dynamics, here is a general outline of what they do and how one might use them.

For context, a repo (repurchase agreement) is a short-term loan – generally overnight – where one party sells securities to another and agrees to repurchase those securities at a date in the near future for a higher price. The securities serve as collateral, and the price difference between the initial sale and repurchase is the repo rate – i.e. the interest paid on the loan. A reverse repo is the opposite of this – i.e. one party buys securities and agrees to sell them back later.

Repo markets serve two important functions for the broader market. The first is that financial institutions such as hedge funds and broker-dealers, who often own lots of securities and little cash, can borrow from money market funds or mutual funds that often have lots of cash.

This liquidity crunch and ensuing government intervention is laying the foundation for bitcoin’s adoption as a safe haven asset.

The hedge funds can use this cash to finance day-to-day operations and trades, and money market funds can earn interest on their cash with little risk. Mostly, the securities used as collateral are U.S. Treasurys.

The second function for repo markets is the Fed has a lever to conduct monetary policy. By buying or selling securities in the repo market, it is able to inject or withdraw money from the financial system. Since the global financial crisis, repo markets have become an even more important tool for the Fed. Sure enough, the 2008 crash was preceded by odd movements in repo markets, showing what a good indicator of the future repo can be.

The fragility of our current financial system

With equities selling off in larger and larger moves and the markets becoming more volatile, the Fed injected liquidity into the short-term markets. While some headlines claim the Fed spent $1.5 trillion in a recent move to calm equities markets, those headlines are a bit sensationalist and are trying to equate last week’s actions to TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program, which allowed the Fed to purchase toxic debt from bank balance sheets along with said banks’ stocks). And I say this as someone with very little trust in the Fed. This wasn’t a bailout but was a move to calm funding markets and the money is now part of the repo markets making it a short-term debt.

Let’s take a step back and think about what that means – short-term markets where parties exchange very liquid collateral had a funding crisis, implying that market participants on aggregate didn’t have cash or didn’t want collateral in return for cash, and needed the intervention of the Fed to continue functioning. There is no way to cut this as a positive. This would go a long way in explaining the wild movements and unprecedented yields hit across the entire yield curve. To make matters worse, this is not a new phenomenon. There was a funding crisis in September 2019 as well. It is clear that the repo markets are struggling without the Fed’s intervention.

Given the fire sale we saw recently, and the whipsaw in the Treasurys markets, I suspect some funds were caught off guard, especially by the move in oil futures, and were unable to get funding. This then led to a sale of assets to generate cash and then a cascade of sales across markets.

What about BTC (and gold)?

To clarify, I keep putting “and gold” in parentheses because the commentary applies to both markets given the nature of their fixed supply. I consider BTC to be a better version of gold as it is provably scarce, among other benefits. However, gold has enamored mankind since…well, the dawn of mankind. So while I think BTC is the better option, gold has a place in portfolios not quite ready for digital currencies.

Bitcoin had a bad week, retracing much of 2019’s gains but remaining positive on a Y/Y basis (though it’s up again more recently). Here are the positives: Bitcoin and traditional safe-haven assets all sold off, bitcoin is now trading very cheaply on a USD basis, and the fundamental analysis and value proposition remains unchanged. Because of bitcoin’s newer, more volatile nature, the moves in this market will naturally be more extreme.

Safe-haven status remains intact

People think bitcoin lost its safe-asset use case but this liquidity crunch and ensuing government intervention is laying the foundation for bitcoin’s adoption as a safe-haven asset.

It’s easy to talk about long-term theses and other “hopeium” in the face of this nascent market’s most extreme recent drawdown and ignore the fact that a ton of people lost a ton of money. So let’s consider the short-term thesis:

A “first-level” analysis would conclude BTC went down while stocks went down, and so there is no “store of value,” nor does it function as a “safe haven.” I cannot stress how useless this commentary is, and masquerading it as “analysis” is somewhat insulting. Anybody with mediocre programming skills can plot two lines and point to a correlation – what value has this analysis added? None.

Gold in 2008

That aside, consider gold in 2008. Gold prices fell sharply at the beginning of the financial crisis, only to rally after TALF (Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facilities), which was a program to increase credit availability and support economic activity by facilitating renewed issuance of consumer and small business asset-backed securities.

Unlike TARP, TALF money came from the Fed and not the U.S. Treasury and so the program did not require congressional approval but an act of Congress forced the Fed to reveal how funds were lent. Other relief measures were implemented and then further bolstered by quantitative easing (QE), where central banks purchase a predetermined number of government bonds to increase the money supply and inject money directly into the economy.

In the U.S. QE started in November 2008 and ended about six years and $4.5 trillion later. This serves to illustrate that safe-haven assets may sell off during a liquidity crunch but afterwards investors begin to see the need for assets with sound money properties that offer protection from currency devaluation.

For cryptocurrency markets, the signs of a pullback were building. I personally watch Bitmex leveraged positions to get an indication of where the market is. Whenever leveraged positions build up to an extreme, the market tends to (possibly is forced to) move in the opposite direction and clear out the leveraged positions. There were over $1 billion in leveraged longs on Bitmex and from what I last read, roughly $700 million of those were wiped out during the week of the sell-off. It is a painful but necessary cleansing.

Because bitcoin is a mined coin with model-able production costs, it is important for fundamental investors to follow miner behavior closely. Leading up to the crash, miner inventory had built up. Miners either sell coins to market or build up reserves to sell when prices are more favorable. This is called the MRI (miner rolling inventory). Chainalysis put out this fascinating chart that shows miners generated inventory vs. inventory sent to exchanges. One could assume miner hoarding is a sign that there is an expectation of a price increase, but a liquidity crunch throws all that out the window, AND historical data suggests that returns are better when miners are not hoarding.

So where do we go from here?

Alternative.me BTC Fear and Greed Index

Losing money sucks, but when you invest or trade it’s something you should get used to. If you’re a stellar investor, you’re probably still losing money 40 percent of the time. So, the short term shows a buying opportunity as we saw a large capitulation last week. Alternative.me’s BTC Fear and Greed Index implies a startling change from last month flipping from a score of 59 (Greed) to 8 (Fear) showing that fear is currently the driving market force, and it’s almost always better to buy when others are fearful.

But I would urge caution. Until we see BTC, gold and Treasurys dislocate from the S&P 500 i.e. break their recent correlation, I am cautiously deploying capital.

On a long horizon, things are going according to plan. The halving is still some blocks and months away. Miners who are already feeling the pain of this price reduction will continue to struggle to be profitable as block rewards are halved. On Sunday, March 15 the Fed slashed baseline interest rates to 0 percent and announced the purchase of $700 billion in bonds and securities to calm financial markets and create an economic stimulus. After the recent pullback in stocks, many of us had assumed the Fed would engage in a new form of QE. If history serves us correctly, this is likely the first of many asset purchase programs.","1.2 Million Italians Can Now Buy Bitcoin From Their Bank

Buying bitcoin just got easier for Italians. The country’s mobile bank Hype has announced a partnership with fintech startup Conio, enabling customers to buy, sell, and securely store BTC from within their banking app. With over a million Italians choosing to bank with Hype, and 60,000 new customers being onboarded each week, the challenger bank’s decision to offer bitcoin is significant.

Believe the Hype

Launched in 2015 by Italian bank Banca Sella, Hype reflects the growing trend towards digital-first challenger banks which cater predominantly to millennials. By linking up with Conio, Hype’s mobile platform saves customers the trouble of using cryptocurrency exchanges to buy bitcoin. Instead, they can purchase the digital currency in-app, without the need for extra verification requirements.

When it comes to bitcoin storage, Milan-based Conio utilizes a multi-key solution, with three keys for each wallet. Because two are necessary to authorize transactions, with one stored on the user’s device, another on Conio’s servers, and a third kept offline by Hype, customers can maintain control over their funds and regain access if they lose their device.

Giving the Customer What They Want

The wallet integration is the result of demand for bitcoin among Hype’s customers, according to CEO Antonio Valitutti: “Over 13% of our customers demanded bitcoin. We heard them, and we did our best to bring them the best solution: that’s why we chose Conio. We are very happy with our partnership, which also demonstrates the pioneering spirit of Hype.”

Christian Miccoli, Conio co-founder and CEO, added, “We are thrilled by this result. It shows that banks must not be afraid of cryptocurrencies, but can instead embrace them and make this sector grow in the future.”

By normalizing BTC and exposing 1.2 million customers to crypto, Hype could play a key role in advancing bitcoin’s cause in the region. Customers will be able to directly use their account balance to buy bitcoin, with a daily purchase limit of €500 and an annual limit of €2,500 for Hype Start accounts. Premium accounts, meanwhile, can buy up to €4,990 per day or €50,000 per year, with the bank claiming a 1% fee for every purchase and sale.

Corona Carnage and a Way Forward for Bitcoin

Italy has been the worst-hit nation amid the covid-19 outbreak, with its death toll overtaking China’s on March 19 and all citizens on lockdown. At the time of writing, 4,032 people have perished from the virus there, with the total number of cases exceeding 41,000.

Last week, the Italian Red Cross and blockchain startup Helperbit announced that they were raising donations in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, with the intention of establishing a second-level advanced medical post for pre-triage of covid-19 cases. So far, the appeal has raised over $17,000. While a mere drop in the ocean given the government’s announcement of a €3.6 billion stimulus package, it indicates that the country is marshaling whatever resources it can to counter the virus.

As central banks desperately inflate the money supply to shore up a flagging economy, the appeal of fixed supply assets such as bitcoin is heightened. As well as being able to buy and sell bitcoin, Hype customers can use their card to pay for goods and services anywhere BTC is accepted. With citizens currently urged to avoid cash payments to prevent spreading the virus via contaminated notes, bitcoin may prove to be a valuable alternative, particularly as a hedge against rising inflation.

Do you think bitcoin will prove its worth as a hedge against inflation? Let us know in the comments section below.

Having criticised the Indian government in the past for mulling to ban cryptocurrencies, billionaire Tim Draper, venture capitalist and founding partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ), Draper Associates, and the founder of Draper Venture Network and Draper University is now hopeful after the Supreme Court’s Judgement that the best ideas will ultimately prevail in the crypto market in India.

While the writ petitions of Siddharth Dalmia, Vijay Pal Dalmia and Rohan Dwaipayan Bhowmick demanding crypto regulations across the country are still pending and listed before the Supreme Court for hearing on April 27, 2020, the IAMAI vs RBI case judgement arrived earlier this month and has reset the crypto discourse in the country.

During an interaction with Inc42, Draper, a third-generation venture capitalist said,

The Supreme Court of India and the Indian government have shown that the best ideas ultimately prevail, and just in time, because the benefits of Bitcoin and crypto over current systems will become apparent during this crisis.

Eight months back, after the Indian government-appointed Inter-Ministerial Committee led by former DEA secretary Subhash Chandra Garg recommended a complete ban through draft ‘Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019’, Draper had then commented that It is akin to the Luddites. They are in fact saying, ‘we will not tolerate progress.’ It will set them back 40 years. Imagine if they did this with the internet?

Draper Backs India’s Crypto Startups

The latest judgement has brought winds of change in the crypto industry. While Zebpay has already made a comeback to India market under a different company name and new leadership, global exchanges such as Binance and OKEx have entered the Indian market as well. Recently, Binance announced the acquisition of Indian exchange WazirX, OKEx entered into a partnership with another Indian exchange CoinDCX.

After the judgement, Draper recently had made a trip to India and interacted with some of the key Indian crypto ecosystem stakeholders. On his plans pertaining to the Indian market, the VC said,

Absolutely! I met several Bitcoin and crypto startups while I was in India last week. I hope to be able to fund a number of them.

Due to the repeated warning over crypto trading in India from Indian government, RBI, banks and other authorities, most leading investors had shied away from investing in Indian crypto startups.

Very few startups have gained the trust of VCs, such as Unocoin from Blume Ventures, Ah! Ventures, Mumbai Angels and others, CoinDCX from Bain Capital, Sanjay Gupta, Utsav Somani and others, Koinex from Pantera Capital, Beenext etc, Zebpay and the now-defunct Coinsecure have been able to successfully raise the funding.

Post the judgement, Binance has already announced setting up a $50 Mn fund to invest in a crypto and blockchain startups and with Draper now keen to invest in, the Indian crypto ecosystem is bound to deepen and expand in India and abroad.

The Bitcoin Volatility

Bitcoin and most of the cryptocurrencies have been time and again criticised for their volatility. The extent of volatility could also be understood by the fact that Bitcoin was trading at around $8K on March 11 and had hit as low as $4.1K on March 12, witnessing a free fall of over 48% within 24 hours, and is currently priced at $6.1K, according to data produced by Coinmarketcap.

What exactly caused such a dip? Draper clarified that institutional panic triggered the fall, so at first crypto paralleled the stock market. Some of the miners were very leveraged and had their loans called so they were forced to sell. After that, some of the hodlers (long-term investors) looked at it as a buying opportunity.

“Long term, I think this crisis will allow people to recognize that bitcoin is simply a better way to hold value and spend money than through our current banking system.”

On Facebook’s Libra, Celo And New Innovations In Crypto

While Bitcoin ETF is yet to be launched, Bitcoin futures has been quite a hit in the market. “I think companies like Opennode and Lightning Network will make it a lot easier to spend bitcoin, and new companies will take advantage of the blockchain and smart contracts to create a more frictionless and honest system of commerce. Taxes can be simpler too as just a fraction of a percentage in a transaction tax.”

Facebook’s Libra and Celo have been quite a buzz in the crypto world in the recent years, while Facebook is planning to revamp Libra project after facing the wrath of authorities across the world and many big companies withdrawing their support from the project, Celo has become the new sensation with as many as 50 companies/organisations backing the project.

What’s Draper’s take on these projects?","Tony Hetherington is Financial Mail on Sunday's ace investigator, fighting readers corners, revealing the truth that lies behind closed doors and winning victories for those who have been left out-of-pocket. Find out how to contact him below.

Arrest: Gal Barak, the Israeli thought to be behind Xtraderfx, has been linked to a raft of crooked firms

M.F. writes: I was contacted by investment company Xtraderfx and told that it would transfer my frozen credit balance of £680 to my NatWest credit card. I agreed and gave my card details, but as a precaution I also asked NatWest if a credit was pending.

I was told that in fact two debits were in the pipeline, one for £680 and a second for £5,000. I had authorised neither, but the bank said they could not be stopped, and the money was taken.

Xtraderfx was a cryptocurrency scam that hid behind Gpay Limited, a Bulgarian-owned business based in Slough, Berkshire.

The Financial Conduct Authority put a warning on its website in 2018, saying that it was unauthorised, so operating illegally.

You told me you invested £6,000 followed by a further £2,000, but by early 2019 there was only £680 left.

Last September, you were suddenly contacted again by Xtraderfx, which offered to return the cash to your NatWest card, but instead it helped itself to a further £680 and then £5,000.

When you telephoned the bank and explained that you were expecting a credit, not two debits, NatWest allowed the funds to be charged to your card.

However, when you received your monthly statement, it showed that the total of £5,680 had been handed over to a company called Cauri.

This is a real payments firm, authorised by the FCA, but it is also a firm you had never heard of, and which you had certainly not authorised to collect a penny.

Unravelling this has taken several months. NatWest told me the payments had already left your account when you called, and it produced recordings of some of your conversations with the bank but admitted that others, including your very first call when you say you tried to stop the payments, had not been recorded.

I argued that even if you had authorised payments to Xtraderfx, it was not acceptable to see the cash go to a different firm with which you had absolutely no relationship, even if it said that it was collecting the money on behalf of Xtraderfx.

Eventually, NatWest agreed to try to claim a chargeback – not because you had been cheated by Xtraderfx, but because an intended credit might have 'accidentally' turned into two debits. But even then, things did not go smoothly.

The bank asked you for your password for Cauri, despite being told you had never heard of it. Chargeback rules allow 45 days for objections to be raised, and just as the 45 days came to an end, Cauri raised an objection and clung on to your cash.

But by this stage, even NatWest had grown suspicious. The bank told me: 'Cauri rejected our attempt at a chargeback, claiming that a cryptocurrency account had been credited. We believe the cryptocurrency account belongs to a scammer and have shared our concern with the merchant acquirer.'

A NatWest spokesperson explained: 'We sympathise with Mr F, who has been the victim of a scam, and appreciate that this has been a very distressing experience for him.'

In light of this, despite not being able to snatch back your money, NatWest itself is refunding it to your card as a gesture of goodwill.

As for Xtraderfx, it was really run from Sofia in Bulgaria, not from Slough. Its alleged boss, Israeli businessman Gal Barak, has been arrested and held for extradition to Austria, where police have been investigating a network of crooked investment companies said to be linked to him.

2020-03-22,"The crypto market saw one of its largest single-day downwards movement last Thursday, with Bitcoin leading a massive selloff that sent the benchmark digital asset reeling to lows of $3,800, subsequently causing most major altcoins to also crater lower.

This led the aggregated crypto market to erase nearly $100 billion off its market capitalization, which declined from $225 billion to $125 billion during a one-day trading period.

Now, the CEO of one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges is sharing his thoughts on what the real cause behind this recent selloff was, also noting that he still views Bitcoin as a safe haven asset even in spite of its recent coupling with the traditional markets.

Binance CEO equates Bitcoin’s recent decline to a “swimming float attached to the Titanic”

Many analysts and investors were disappointed to see Bitcoin decline alongside the traditional markets, seemingly invalidating its status as a “safe haven” asset.

Changpeng Zhao – the CEO and founder of Binance who often goes by the nickname “CZ” – spoke about the invalidation of this narrative in a recent blog post, explaining that he still views Bitcoin and other cryptos as safe-haven assets, but that the intense turbulence in the global economy was simply too much for the small market to tolerate.

He equates the crypto market’s recent decline to a “swimming float” being attached to the Titanic as it sinks, further going on to claim that eventually, cryptocurrencies will be able to decouple from the traditional market.

“Say you take a swimming float, it works and it will help you float in water. Now let’s say it’s attached to the Titanic as it is sinking. Will that float work get you to the surface now? No, it won’t. Is it because the float no longer works? No, the floating properties of the float still work.”

Here’s the real reason the crypto market crashed in CZ’s eyes

CZ further went on to explain that the recent capitulatory selloff in the crypto market came about due to two primary factors.

Firstly, he notes that the non-die-hard crypto investors likely took the recent turbulence in the traditional markets as a reason to justify exiting their crypto position, creating a torrent of selling pressure that perpetuated as prices declined.

Secondly, he notes that many investors likely turned to sell off their crypto holdings in order to free up capital in order to pay rent and prepare for potential changes in their job situation due to the global instability.

Because all of these investors have already exited the relatively small crypto market, it is a strong possibility that a long-term bottom is in and that traditional investors may begin entering fresh positions in crypto if Bitcoin and other digital assets are able to begin decoupling from the traditional markets.

Spring is in the air for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, and that means it is time to get started with some spring cleaning – especially for those of us with crypto holdings.

If you trade cryptocurrency on a relatively frequent basis, you will probably have tiny sums in exchange wallets that are too small to trade or withdraw as they fall below the transaction value requirements to take such actions.

Some types of dust can even be harmful – especially if you are not the one who accumulated it.

Fortunately, there are a number of ways to address the problem of accumulating all this “crypto dust.”

Learn what crypto dust is – and discover what you can do about it.

What is crypto dust?

In the crypto markets, dust refers to a fraction of a cryptocurrency token that is so small that it cannot be traded. As a result, most crypto dust lies idle in exchange wallets.

In some cases, the holdings in questions are exceptionally small, to the extent that they cannot even be moved off the exchange and into a personal wallet as they do not meet minimum withdrawal value requirements.

While crypto dust may not sound like a massive issue, there is actually a substantial amount of capital effectively locked away in wallets that could otherwise be deployed to provide market liquidity and help the industry grow.

Can I do anything about my crypto dust?

Your ability to deal with crypto dust will depend largely on the policies of the exchange where it has been piling up.

Unfortunately, most exchanges have done little or nothing to address this issue.

Most exchanges have minimum trade size requirements, such as 0.001 of a token, and have a minimum withdrawal value requirement to cover transaction fees.

However, if you happen to have any smaller holdings on Binance, you can use the exchange’s “Convert into BNB” feature, which lets users to convert all holdings – including crypto dust – into the company’s native Binance Coin (BNB) with the click of a button.

But even if your exchange does not offer this sort of feature, there are other ways of getting around your dust problems.

One more obvious solution involves topping up the cryptocurrency dust to the point where its value meets the minimum trading limit. From there, you can convert it to your token of choice.

Alternatively, you could top up your dust to the point where it meets your exchange’s minimum withdrawal value requirement. Then you can transfer your smaller holdings to an exchange, and use available crypto dust cleaning features.

From there, it should be an easy process if you want to withdraw the funds to your bank account – as long as you have a verified account and have set up a fiat on/off-ramp.

The dark side of dust: Dusting attacks

You cannot talk about crypto dust without mentioning dusting attacks. While crypto dust piling up on exchanges can be a mild annoyance for traders, the threat of a dusting attack for privacy-conscious crypto users is arguably a much more serious matter.

Generally speaking, dusting attacks involve malicious actors attempting to uncover the identity of the users of a public blockchain network such as Bitcoin (BTC). They do this by sending a tiny amount of cryptocurrency to a BTC wallet.

The subsequent transactional activities that make use of these addresses can then be tracked in an attempt to gain insight into fund flows and, potentially, the real-world identity of the owners of the addresses they target.

The developers of the privacy-focused bitcoin wallet Samourai Wallet warned of the dangers of this type of attack on Twitter back in October 2018, stating:

“If you have recently received a very small amount of BTC in your wallet unexpectedly, you may be the target of a ""dusting attack"" designed to de-anonymise you by linking your inputs together.”

If you value your privacy, it pays to be very skeptical if any small, inexplicable cryptocurrency payments turn up in any of your wallets – even those you rarely make use of.

If you do receive a small transaction like this, you may want to run your coins through a mixing service to ensure your privacy is not compromised.

Dust-busting pays – whether you are responsible for its creation or not, clearing it up can be both profitable and safe.","The Australian share market fell sharply during its opening session of trading on Monday (AEST) after the country’s Prime Minister announced drastic measures to curb the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

Reeling from its worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 has fallen from Friday’s close of 4,816 basis points to around 4,536, after Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared historic measures to curb the rise of COVID-19 from within the country.

On Sunday, March 22, Morrison ordered all pubs, clubs, churches and indoor sporting venues must close until further notice, while essential services such as grocery stores, gas stations and banks were to remain open. Australian schools will remain open for now. As of Sunday morning, the government reported 1,098 confirmed cases and seven deaths.

The new measures aim to limit the spread of the deadly virus that has sent developed economies into free fall in recent weeks, with the ASX responding with a 8.2 percent drop during the early Asian trading hours, revealing what could be in store this week for U.S. equities when they open Monday.

The chief investment officer at Orthogonal Trading, Joshua Green, said the downward pressure currently being experienced in the Aussie share market was the result of much of the same seen over last week’s trade.

“I think the ASX is being driven by global equities, which are being driven by a combination of momentum selling, panic selling and de-levering on the back of coronavirus fears,” Green said.

“The market clearly wants some sort of fiscal deal in the US which appears to be a struggle due to partisanship,” he added.

Meanwhile in crypto, bitcoin (BTC) has fallen 5 percent on the day, from $6,200 to $5,894 with the rest of the market suffering a similar fate, signaling the potential for further bloodletting when U.S. equities markets open their doors for trading in the next 16 hours or so.","The best Sundays are for long reads and deep conversations.

This week on Let’s Talk Bitcoin we’re discussing the coming bailout-everything regime in a topic that’s both extremely timely but is also what originally forced many long-term bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts to learn about money and become interested in cryptocurrency in the first place.

As much of the world on an almost uniform and bipartisan basis shuts down to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prepares to bail out first financial markets and now basically everything that can’t work on a fully remote basis, we’re talking about crisis, bailouts, the limits of monetary policy and the real possibility that it’s not a straw that breaks the back of our money but rather the whole world suddenly jumping on.

On today’s show we’ll discuss:

The growing bipartisan and global shutdown then ""bailout everything"" movement

The alternative to the bailout path we're on

The inability of even extraordinary monetary policy to resolve these issues and the markets' growing cognitive dissonance

The revival of the ""system is breaking and when it does we'll need something new that doesn't share the same problems of being vulnerable to politically expedient overreactions"" narrative that, frankly, drove my initial interest in bitcoin in the first place

Some of the #CoronaEfforts we've heard about so far and how you can help

And much more in this wide-ranging discussion...

Today’s episode of Let’s Talk Bitcoin! featured Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Stephanie Murphy, Jonathan Mohan and Adam B. Levine.","Financial markets are facing their worst crisis since 1929 and people are looking for alternatives to protect themselves from the crash. One option being considered by many is cryptocurrency.

In response, Bank of China has continued its anti-crypto narrative in a long post titled “3.15 Protetion of Financial Consumption Rights and Interests”. The post was published on the bank’s official WeChat account on March 22.

In the post, bank officials warn the public about cryptocurrency investment, calling out the three main scams seen on crypto exchanges. The bank stated:

“First of all, the amount of fraud transactions with bots is serious. The average turnover rate of the top three overseas crypto currency exchanges is much higher than that of foreign licensed exchanges. Second, market manipulation exists in these exchanges where forced leveraged trading eventually causes the exchanges to explode. Third, money laundering is a big issue.”

The Bank of China post also pointed out that the claim that Bitcoin is a safe haven is false, as it is too volatile. The bank urges people to protect themselves from following the crowd by abstaining from crypto investment.

China has never liked cryptocurrency trading

As Cointelegraph reported last year, Alipay banned transactions related to Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.

At the beginning of 2018, local authorities started cracking down on market-making platforms and other “exchange-like” services relating to cryptocurrency.

In September 2017, Chinese regulators placed a ban on local cryptocurrency exchanges, and sought to crack down on all domestic cryptocurrency trading.

Bitcoin is resilient

2020-03-23,"Gold is up Monday and so are most cryptocurrencies, seemingly buoyed by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s drastic quantitative easing action to thwart the coronavirus’ effects on markets and the economy.

Bitcoin (BTC) is up 7 percent as of 20:30 UTC. Over the past 24 hours it has been trading in a $5,600-$6,600 range coming out of a quiet weekend for the crypto market.

Crypto asset performances to note on the day include bitcoin cash (BCH) up 13 percent, litecoin (LTC) in the green 7 percent and bitcoin SV (BSV) up 6 percent. The only asset down in the dumps on CoinDesk’s asset board today is Decred, down less than a percent.

The Fed’s announcement of open-ended asset purchases plus $300 billion in emergency lending programs to stave off further economic downfall coincided with a boost in crypto and gold prices.

The U.S. is in the midst of an unprecedented economic halt, with no end in sight. The state of New York has been among those hit hardest, according to Centers for Disease Control data.

“As the Fed implements more programs to backstop the financial system, such as this morning’s announcement of them buying corporate bonds and agency MBS [mortgage-backed securities], we will see the pressure ease on bitcoin and gold from the collateral selling/leverage unwind side,” said Siddhartha Jha, founder of Arbol, a blockchain-based weather insurance platform.

Cryptocurrency investors are keen to see what happens should possible endless money printing boost spending.

“The price to pay is inflation in the long run. Inflation expectations are popping and the long end of the treasuries (sic) curve is already pricing it in,” economist and trader Alex Kruger noted in a tweet.

It remains to be seen how government measures will affect inflation rates going forward, but it could make investors look towards alternative asset classes such as cryptocurrencies or gold. Yet, these assets still might not be what people want since a shock to the system can cause people to sell assets for cash to stuff in a mattress.","Why did this happen?

“The Supreme Court of India and the Indian government have shown that the best ideas ultimately prevail, and just in time because the benefits of bitcoin and crypto over current systems will become apparent during this crisis,” Draper said.

In April 2018, a Reserve Bank of India order barred domestic financial institutions from providing banking services to crypto exchanges severely hamstringing the domestic crypto market as it sought to impose strict regulations.

The local crypto scene struggled in legal limbo until, after two years, a March 4 court ruling overturned the ban, arguing the central bank had not been balanced in its decision to cut off crypto firms’ banking services.","Both bitcoin and the U.S. stock markets are staring at a “death cross” – a widely tracked, bearish chart indicator – having suffered sharp losses over the last five weeks.

For bitcoin (BTC), the pattern is arising as the 50-day moving average (MA) moves to cross below the 200-day MA, likely in the next day or two. If confirmed, it would be the first death cross since Oct. 26, 2019, according to Bitstamp data.

Meanwhile, similar crosses are forming on Wall Street equity indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the S&P 500.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The death cross is a long-term bear market signal, according to technical analysis theory. Despite the scary name, it’s based on backward-looking moving average data and is the product of a recent notable price drop.

For example, the impending bitcoin death cross is preceded by the decline from $10,500 to $4,000 in the four weeks to March 13. The massive sell-off has caused the 50-day average to turn lower and drop to the 200-day average.

Bitcoin and Dow Jones crosses

Similarly, the Dow has tanked by more than 35 percent over the last five weeks and is likely to witness its death cross on Monday.

It should be noted that, as a lagging indicator, the death cross often traps sellers on the wrong side of the market, as seen on the historical bitcoin chart below.

As the averages closed in on the death cross on Oct. 25, 2019, the cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid and rose from $6,500 to $10,350 in less than 48 hours.

Another such cross, confirmed at the end of March 2018, was followed by a rise from $6,500 to $9,950.

That said, with the global markets still in panic mode courtesy of the coronavirus outbreak, the latest death cross may not turn out to be a contrary indicator. Amid fears of a recession, investors are treating bitcoin as a source of liquidity rather than a safe haven, as had been anticipated by many.

“Another turbulent week can be expected for Asia markets as more countries lock down in the fight against COVID-19. The West is not looking too great either,” Toby Wu, senior analyst at investment platform eToro, told CoinDesk.

Futures on the S&P 500 fell by 5 percent early Monday, triggering a limit down, while stocks in Asia cratered after the U.S. Senate failed to advance its coronavirus rescue package, bolstering recession fears. At press time, S&P 500 futures are down 3 percent and major European indices are flashing red.

As a result, bitcoin is likely to remain on the defensive. The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $5,840, representing a 6.57 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Daily and 12-hour charts

Bitcoin is trading within the range of the big doji candle created on March 20 for the fourth straight day, a sign of indecision in the market place.

Acceptance under the candle low of $5,670 would imply an end to the corrective bounce from recent lows under $4,000 and shift risk in favor of a drop to $5,000.

That looks likely, as the 12-hour chart shows the cryptocurrency has dived out of an ascending channel.

A move above $6,460 (March 21 high) is needed to alleviate the bearish pressures and open the doors to $7,000.","The global market meltdown has indirectly benefited Russia’s bitcoin miners, even as the cryptocurrency’s price tumbled along with other assets.

That’s because the Russian national currency has rapidly lost value, dropping from 60 rubles to the dollar to 80 in two weeks. In addition to the coronavirus pandemic weighing on all markets, the ruble has also taken a hit from the price war started by Saudi Arabia, which slashed the price of oil, Russia’s main import, to its lowest level in three years.

With the ruble plunging, the average price in Russia for electricity, one of the biggest costs for miners, also dropped. In Siberia, Russia’s main region for mining, the average price for power available to local mining farms fell from 5 cents per megawatt per hour to 4.

At the same time, the price of bitcoin (BTC), while plunging itself, still is calculated in U.S. dollars, which makes the bear market a bit less painful for mining farms in Russia, several such outfits told CoinDesk.

In other words, with bitcoin trading around $6,200 Monday, if you sold bitcoin for rubles the price would be $6,200 times 80 rubles, not 60 rubles as it would have been two weeks ago. Thus, the hit to revenue is mitigated for miners that run their specialized computers from these farms.

“As the cryptocurrency price is bound to the U.S. dollar, the ruble’s fall is beneficial” for miners, said Alexander Shashkov, the founder of Intelion Mining.

Igor Runets, CEO of the Bitriver mining facility in Bratsk, Russia, said he signed two new contracts with miners last week for a total of 24 megawatts per hour of electricity.

All expenses at the farm are in rubles, Runets says, so “with the ruble falling down, Russia is strengthening its position on the [mining] market.” He’s also planning to leverage forward spread contracts for buying dollars at an agreed price in future, to hedge against the ruble possibly going up later. Bitriver is now in talks with one of the Russian banks about buying such contracts, Runets said.

“Dollar exchange rate does not affect the price of electricity. Salaries and other costs don’t rise that fast either,” said Zakhar Fedorov, the business development manager at Cryptoreactor, another mining farm in Bratsk. However, his farm hasn’t seen an inflow of new clients from abroad yet.

“We do have requests from the foreign miners, but no more than usual. Due to the bitcoin price crash and the hysteria around coronavirus, in such a situation many prefer to sit on cash,” Fedorov added.","When it comes to auto-trading cryptocurrencies, it can be hard to know which platforms are reliable, safe and trustworthy.

With its simple and automated functionality, it could be the perfect introduction to the world of cryptocurrency investment.","Tokyo-based financial services company Monex Group has announced that it will grant a small amount of Bitcoin as a year-end shareholder benefit for the fiscal year 2019.

The BTC will only be gifted to shareholders who hold accounts at cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, which is operated by a Monex subsidiary.

Eligible shareholders who hold the company’s shares as of March 31st will receive 500 JPY worth of Bitcoin, roughly 0.00077 BTC or roughly $4.53 at the time of writing–a small amount, to be sure, but the benefit seems to be a small symbol of Monex’s continued support for and interest in the cryptocurrency industry.

The BTC will be granted in addition to Monex points, which have traditionally been distributed as a shareholder benefit by the company. Coincidentally, however, the company announced in April of last year that it would allow Monex Points to be exchanged for cryptocurrencies.

Is Monex encouraging shareholders to hold and trade crypto?

Monex originally decided to grant Coincheck-account-holding shareholders with 500 JPY worth of BTC in September of last year, citing increased interest in cryptocurrency.

Monex’s efforts to foster the cryptocurrency industry also made news in February, when the company was listed as a participant in a CoolBitX’s $16.7 million funding round.

Additionally, in November, a US-based Monex Group subsidiary known as Trade Station announced that it would be launching a cryptocurrency brokerage platform through a newly-formed crypto division, aptly named “Trade Station Crypto.”

Japan still leads the charge in the global crypto industry

Monex Group’s home country of Japan has long been slated as one of the most advanced nations in the world when it comes to the regulation and adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Just last week, several Japanese financial institutions–Brokerage SMBC Nikko Securities, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, and general trading company Mitsui & Co.–announced that they would be joining forces with blockchain startup LayerX to form an asset management company for blockchain-based assets, dubbed “Mitsui & Co. Digital Asset Management.”

Additionally, Toyota Financial Services, the financial offshoot of the well-known automotive manufacturer, announced the completion of a blockchain-based platform for vehicle and personal IDs. The project also involves the Toyota Blockchain Lab.","The non-profit that holds funds raised in Tezos’ $400 million initial coin offering (ICO) sold as many as 8,000 bitcoins (BTC) in 2019.

The share of the Tezos Foundation’s portfolio made up of bitcoin fell from 61 percent in July to 47 percent as of the end of January, the non-profit disclosed in its biannual report, released Thursday. The value was reinvested into XTZ tokens and into other asset classes.

Per the report, the Tezos Foundation, which is based in Switzerland, held approximately $397.7 million worth of bitcoin on July 31, 2019. As bitcoin traded at the $10,000 mark, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the foundation held roughly 39,700 bitcoins.

As of Jan. 31, the foundation held 31,800 bitcoin, worth roughly $298.5 million based on a spot price of $9,400. That means the foundation sold as many as 8,000 bitcoins, which, even with the recent downturn in prices, would still be worth as much as $53 million today.

The total value of the foundation’s portfolio fell from $652 million on July 31 to $625 million by Jan. 31. It is managed by an asset-management strategy that is established and reviewed by the Tezos Foundation Council – the group that leads the organization – on a regular basis, according to the report.

Value was reinvested into other asset classes, including bonds, equities and fiat currencies.

The foundation also increased its tezos (XTZ) token exposure, upping the share from 15 percent to 23 percent. With the XTZ price increasing by nearly 40 percent in the six months between the reports, according to CoinGecko, the value of holdings went up by approximately $48.2 million.

Roman Schnider, CFO of the Tezos Foundation, told CoinDesk that although it considered bitcoin to be a “key store of value,” its asset strategy policy was to focus and pay for its long-term objectives “without being distracted by short-term market moves.”

Investments into a stability fund – a diversified range of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and bonds – as well as fiat currencies, acted as risk management instruments that ensured “operational effectiveness” against crypto volatility, Schnider added.

In Thursday’s report, the Tezos Foundation said it had no plans to liquidate any of the XTZ allocated from the genesis block or generated from its own baking activities, a form of staking used to produce blocks and secure the tezos protocol.",

The U.S. Federal Reserve's open-ended easing program is a long-run positive for bitcoin's (BTC) price, according to analysts.

With stocks flashing green and technical indicators pointing to a strengthening of upward momentum, bitcoin looks set to test resistance at $7,000.

Monday's low of $5,686 is the level to beat for the bears.

Bitcoin is marching northwards as the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary economic measures boosts risk appetite in the traditional markets.

The top cryptocurrency by market value rose as high as $6,863 early Tuesday, having jumped from $5,700 to $,6600 on Monday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

A major part of Monday’s double-digit price rise came after the Fed announced its “bazooka” move to expand asset purchases by as much as needed (that is, with no upper limit) to help the economy absorb shocks arising from the coronavirus pandemic.

Good for bitcoin?

There’s now a general consensus in the analyst community that the unconventional policies adopted by the Fed and other central banks could bode well for bitcoin.

“We foresee increasing capital deployment into bitcoin as a result of a ‘lack of confidence’ across central banks and governments during this volatile period,” Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack, provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

Central banks from New Zealand to Canada have reduced rates to zero and announced bond purchases over the last two weeks to counter the coronavirus-led economic slowdown. The likes of the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have instigated negative interest rate policies.

With central banks running out of steam to battle the virus jitters, there’s scope for bitcoin to fulfill a non-correlated and decentralized value proposition, according to Neo.

Similar sentiments were echoed by popular analyst Joseph Young and Genesis Node’s co-founder David Parkinson.

Some observers are also of the opinion that the ongoing crisis will strengthen bitcoin’s appeal as “internet money.”

Major cities across the world have been put into lockdown to stall the virus outbreak, causing a shutdown of most commercial activities. So a prolonged crisis could push people toward bitcoin as a decentralized cryptocurrency without a central bank or administrator that can be sent and received anywhere in the world at any time.

“The longer the people

can’t go outside to conduct their business, the more useful the cryptocurrency

should become as it can be sent and received from the safety of one’s home,” Justin Gillespie, CEO of Titus Investment Advisors and bitcoin

trader told CoinDesk.

Charlie Morris, head of multi-asset management at London-based Atlantic House Fund Management said, “The crisis highlights the importance of the internet, and bitcoin is internet money. Gold lives in the real world and the refiners have shut down due to the virus. Bitcoin remains unscathed, which will broaden its appeal and lead to network growth.”

“Bitcoin will emerge from this crisis in better shape, with more credibility than it has ever enjoyed before,” Morris said.

Not there yet

While the long-run prospects look bright, the cryptocurrency’s immediate trajectory will likely be heavily influenced by action in the stock markets.

The 90-day correlation

between bitcoin’s price and the S&P 500 recently rose to 0.52, the highest

level on record, according to Arcane Research.

Global equities are flashing green at press time, possibly in response to the Fed’s all-out effort in combating recession fears. The Euro Stoxx 50 – Europe’s benchmark equity index – is currently up 5.5 percent on the day, while futures tied to the S&P 500 are reporting a 5 percent gain. Stocks in Asia also put in a positive performance.

What’s more, gold, the classic haven asset, has added 4 percent and trading near $1,600. The metal rose by 3 percent on Monday.

As a result, bitcoin could challenge the psychological resistance of $7,000 in the next 24 hours or so. Technical studies, too, are painting a bullish picture.

Daily chart

Bitcoin jumped 11.7 percent on Monday, engulfing Sunday’s negative price action and signaling a continuation of the recovery rally from recent lows below $4,000.

The 14-day relative strength index has breached the descending trendline in favor of the bulls, while the MACD histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bullish reversal.

Next, resistance at $7,139 (March 20 high) could come into play.

“With the price now making higher highs and higher lows in the short term, this suggests we could get back to $7,000 in the coming days,” Simon Peters, analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro told CoinDesk. “However, we’ll have to see if the markets have enough momentum to break and importantly stay above this level, or if we see the $7,000 level hold as resistance and the price retreat, as we saw March 20.”

A failure to make a sustained move above the resistance of the descending 5-week moving average at $6,910 could yield a drop to $6,500.

The outlook, however, would turn bearish only below Monday’s low of $5,686. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $6,720, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.","The last Bitcoin halving took place on May 11, 2020, and the next halving will likely occur in 2024. What is the halving, how does it affect the price, and what does it mean for miners and the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects? Here’s everything you need to know.

“The halvening” sounds like a horror movie about an ax murderer. But it’s actually the nickname for one of the most hotly anticipated events in Bitcoin’s history.

In May 2020, the number of bitcoins (BTC) entering circulation every 10 minutes (known as block rewards) dropped by half, to 6.25 from 12.5. It’s a milestone that was easy to see coming because it happens every four years and has happened twice before 2020.

The allure of possible riches is what’s drawing so much attention to the upcoming event, which is more commonly referred to as the halving (some wags like to add the “en” to make it sound ominous). The amount of supply entering the system will suddenly shrink, but the demand will, in theory, stay the same, possibly driving up the cryptocurrency’s price. As such, the event has inspired passionate debate about bitcoin price predictions and how the market will respond.

“The theory is that there will be less bitcoin available to buy if miners have less to sell,” said Michael Dubrovsky, co-founder of mining R&D nonprofit PoWx.

But the periodic decline in Bitcoin’s minting rate could have a deeper significance than any near-term price movements for the functioning of the currency. The block reward is an important component of Bitcoin, one that ensures the security of this leaderless system. As the rewards dwindle to zero in the decades ahead, it could potentially destabilize the economic incentives underlying bitcoin’s security.

For those trying to make sense of this complex topic, CoinDesk offers the following explainer of Bitcoin’s third halving.

What is the bitcoin halving?

New bitcoins enter circulation as block rewards, produced by “miners” who use expensive electronic equipment to earn or “mine” them.

Every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, the total number of bitcoin that miners can potentially win is halved.

Bitcoin supply and subsidy. Source: CoinDesk Research

In 2009, the system started at 50 coins mined every 10 minutes. Two halvings later, 12.5 bitcoins are currently being dispensed every 10 minutes.

This process will end with a total of 21 million coins, probably in the year 2140.

Who chose the Bitcoin distribution schedule? Why?

Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who may have been an individual or a team, disappeared roughly a year after releasing the software into the world. So, he or she or they (we’ll just go with “they” from now on) are no longer around to explain why they chose this specific formula for adding new bitcoin into circulation.

But early emails written by Nakamoto shed some light on the mysterious figure’s thinking.

Shortly after releasing the Bitcoin white paper, Nakamoto summarized the various ways their chosen monetary policy (the schedule by which miners receive block rewards) could play out, pondering the circumstances under which it could lead to deflation (when a currency’s purchasing power increases) or inflation (when the prices of goods and services purchasable with a currency increase).

At the time, Nakamoto couldn’t have known how many people would use the new online money (if anyone).

They elaborated very little on why they chose the particular formula they did: “Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.”

In most state-issued currencies a central bank, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, has tools at its disposal that enable it to add or remove dollars from circulation. If the economy is floundering, for instance, the Fed can increase circulation and encourage lending by purchasing securities from banks. Alternately, if the Fed wants to remove dollars from the economy, it can sell securities from its account.

At the time, Nakamoto couldn’t have known how many people would use the new online money (if anyone).

For better or worse, bitcoin is a bit different. For one, the supply schedule is all but set in stone.

Unlike the monetary policy of state-issued currencies, which unfold through political processes and human institutions, Bitcoin’s monetary policy is written into code shared across the network. Changing it would require an immense output of coordination and agreement across the community of Bitcoin users.

“Unlike most national currencies we’re familiar with like dollars or euros, bitcoin was designed with a fixed supply and predictable inflation schedule. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. This predetermined number makes them scarce, and it’s this scarcity alongside their utility that largely influences their market value,” crypto wallet company Blockchain.com wrote in a blog post ahead of the 2016 halving.

Another unique aspect of Bitcoin is Nakamoto programmed the block reward to decrease over time. This is another way in which it differs from the norm for modern financial systems, where central banks control the money supply. In stark contrast to Bitcoin’s halving block reward, the supply of the dollar has roughly tripled since 2000.

Nakamoto left clues that they created Bitcoin for political reasons. The first Bitcoin block features the headline of a newspaper article: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

Many have come to interpret it as a sign of Nakamoto’s political beliefs and goals. If widely adopted, Bitcoin could potentially reduce the power banks and governments have over monetary policy, including bailouts of struggling institutions. As shown with the block reward, no central entity can create bitcoin outside of the strict schedule.

How does the halving influence bitcoin's price?

A bitcoin halving grabs so much attention mostly because many believe it will lead to a price increase. The truth is, no one knows what’s going to happen.

Bitcoin has seen two halvings so far, which we can look to as precedent.

The 2012 halving provided the first demonstration of how markets would respond to Nakamoto’s unorthodox supply schedule. Until then, the Bitcoin community didn’t know how a sudden decline in rewards would affect the network. As it turned out, the price began to rise shortly after the halving.

The second halving in 2016 was highly anticipated, as is the one now approaching, with CoinDesk running a live blog of the event and Blockchain.com putting out a “countdown.” Each halving has encouraged vigorous speculation about how the event would affect bitcoin’s price.

On July 16, 2016, the day of the second halving, the price dropped by 10 percent to $610, but then shot back up to where it was before. There was little evidence the sudden reduction in bitcoin’s minting rate had a long-term impact on the price. At the time, CoinDesk’s Jacob Donnelly went so far as to call the event a “boring vindication.”

While the immediate impact on the price of bitcoin was small, the market did tally a gradual increase over the year following the second halving. Some argue this increase was a delayed result of the halving. The theory is that when the supply of bitcoin declines, the demand for bitcoin will stay the same, pushing the price up. If that theory is correct, then we could observe similar price increases after future halvings, including the one scheduled for this year.

Others argue that given the predictability of bitcoin’s halving schedule, this change in the minting rate is unlikely to shift the price. Traders have long known the bitcoin block reward will decrease, giving them ample time to prepare.

It’s possible that if enough people know about a halving in advance, they will buy bitcoin in anticipation, pushing the price up before the halving instead of after. This is what people mean when they argue the halving is “priced in.”

Why do miners get these rewards?

Bitcoin wouldn’t work at all without these block rewards.

As pseudonymous independent researcher Hasu put it, there are two parts to making Bitcoin work. “Bitcoin’s ledger state should answer the question of ‘who owns what, when?’” Hasu told CoinDesk.

The first part, “who owns what?” is solved by cryptography. Only the owner of a private key (which is like a secret access code) can spend the bitcoin.

The game theory that secures Bitcoin requires that a) miners have an incentive to mine honest blocks [and] b) miners have a cost ... to attempting dishonesty.

“The second half (‘when?’) is the big challenge and was unsolved before Bitcoin,” Hasu explained. Otherwise, it’s easy for people to “double-spend” their coins, effectively creating money from thin air.

Without the block rewards, the network would be in chaos. Hasu explains that if they have enough computing power, miners can attack the network in two ways: By double-spending coins or by stopping transactions from going through. But they are strongly incentivized not to try either, because then they would risk losing their block rewards.

“The game theory that secures Bitcoin requires that a) miners have an incentive to mine honest blocks [and] b) miners have a cost … to attempting dishonesty,” Dubrovsky said.

In other words, miners will lose money if they don’t follow the rules.

The more computing power miners direct towards Bitcoin, the harder it is to attack because an attacker would need to have a significant portion of this processing power, known as the hashrate, to execute such an attack.

The more money they can earn by way of block rewards, the more mining power goes to Bitcoin, and thus the more protected the network is.

What happens when block rewards get very small or taper off entirely?

That is why the periodic decrease in rewards might eventually become an issue.

Miners need an incentive to do what they do. They need to get paid. They’re not running these expensive, electricity-guzzling computers for their health after all.

But the consequence of this dropping block reward is that eventually, it will dwindle to nothing. Transaction fees, which users pay each time they send a transaction, are the other way miners earn money. (Theoretically, these fees are optional, although as a practical matter a transaction without one might have to wait a long time to be processed if the network is congested; the size of the fee is set by the user or their wallet software.) The fees are expected to become a more important source of remuneration for miners as the block reward falls.

“In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes. I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume,” Nakamoto wrote.

But for a long time, Bitcoin researchers have been considering the possibility transaction fees won’t suffice. For one thing, it means transactions might need to grow more expensive over time to keep the network as secure.

It’s impossible to predict what will happen, but if we want a system that could last 100 years, we should be ready for the worst case.

“This cannot really work without very expensive transaction costs because Bitcoin cannot process huge quantities of transactions on-chain,” Dubrovsky said.

And, as discussed above, it is mining rewards that draw more computing power to Bitcoin, hardening it against attacks that try to circumvent the network’s rules. It’s unclear whether a future attenuated block reward will have the same allure for miners, even when supplemented with fees.

“I don’t think this halving will make Bitcoin significantly less secure, but in eight to 12 years we could find ourselves in hot water,” Hasu said.

Part of the problem is that more than a decade after Bitcoin’s birth the market is still figuring out the true cost of protecting the network from attackers.

“Nobody knows the correct level of security needed to keep Bitcoin safe. Currently, Bitcoin pays out something like $5 billion per year and there are no successful attacks; however, there has been no price discovery. Bitcoin may be overpaying. To really find out the minimum level of security needed to avoid attacks, the mining rewards would need to be dropped to the point where attacks start happening and then increased until the attacks stop,” Dubrovsky argued.

“Of course, this would be catastrophic for Bitcoin as it’s designed now, but it could really come to some kind of scenario like this if rewards dwindle and the Bitcoin community doesn’t do anything about it,” he added.

Hasu said he “hopes” transaction fees will be enough to incentivize the security of Bitcoin in the end, but he thinks it’s worth anticipating the “worst case.”

“It should be clear that the incentive to attack Bitcoin today is larger than it was five years ago. We now have [U.S. President Donald] Trump, [China President Xi Jinping] and other world leaders talking critically about it. The more Bitcoin grows, the more they might see it as a threat and might eventually feel forced to react. That would be the worst case, anyway,” Hasu said.

This question is an interesting one to ponder when thinking about Bitcoin’s future prospects, though it might sound like a far-off matter in 2020.

“It’s impossible to predict what will happen, but if we want a system that could last 100 years, we should be ready for the worst case,” Hasu said. “The worst case is demand for blockspace does not increase in the dramatic fashion that would be needed. As a result, block rewards would eventually trend toward zero.”","Sponsored: This guide can introduce newcomers to some of the most common bitcoin trading strategies.

A report from the Blockchain Transparency Institute indicates that wash trading by cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped significantly this year.

This is a sponsored article provided byNordikCoin.

Bitcoin trading has never been more popular than it is now, and the market doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. So, if you’ve considered getting in on the action, now is the time to strike.

While there are numerous bitcoin trading tools available, you still need an understanding of the basic strategies to succeed.

We’ve created this guide to introduce newcomers to some of the most common trading strategies. But seasoned traders may also wish to refresh their memories and adopt new strategies for 2020.

Here’s what we’ll cover in this trading strategy guide:

HODling

Hedging

Trend trading

Breakout trading

If you’re eager to get started, then we suggest you head over to NordikCoin and create an account now. It only takes a few minutes, and then you’re ready to buy and sell bitcoin.

1. HODLing

The term “HODL” was coined on the Bitcointalk forum back in 2013. It’s not an acronym for a complex trading strategy — it’s simply the word “hold” misspelled. The author of the original post mused that traders who were new to the game or unsure of their trading skills were better off HODLing their bitcoin in a bear market.

Back in 2013, bitcoin saw a surge from less than $15 per BTC to over $1,000 toward the end of the same year. The term “HODL” has appeared in numerous cryptocurrency memes and is now a widely-recognized trading strategy.

The premise is simple: Hold onto your bitcoin and hope that the price will surge again so you can sell with massive gains. It’s not a very elaborate trading strategy, but it can be sound advice for new traders.

It’s worth noting, however, that the bitcoin price could also dip instead of rising. That’s why we advise you to have a plan for risk management in place if you choose to go this route.

2. Hedging

Ever heard of the term “hedge your bets”? That’s exactly what this trading strategy is all about.

Since bitcoin is volatile, there’s always a chance that you’ll lose money on trades in the short term. That’s why it can be a good idea to hedge your bets by opening a trade that’ll mitigate that risk.

There are a few ways to go about that.

You can short-sell, which means you sell your bitcoin with the expectation that the price will go down so you can buy it back at a lower rate. Many traders will borrow bitcoin from a broker, trade it on an exchange and then return the amount they borrowed.

But that can be risky if the price goes up instead of down.

You can also hedge with contracts for difference (CFDs), which are derivatives rather than actual cryptocurrency. In that case, you’ll hold your bitcoin in the hopes that the price will go up in the long run, but open a CFD that bets on the price falling. Whether the price actually goes up or down, your gain on bitcoin or the CFD will offset the loss on the other.

Finally, you can hedge your bets with bitcoin futures. These are contracts between two parties who agree to trade bitcoin at a certain price on a specific future date. Whether the price of bitcoin has gone up or down on that date, you’ll make the trade and take either the win or the loss.



3. Trend Trading

Trend trading is a strategy that relies on the current trends in the Bitcoin world. You’ll need to keep a close eye on what others are talking about and plan to do.

For example, bitcoin became incredibly popular in 2017, when the price rose to almost $20,000 per BTC. There were many reasons for that, but the main one was that bitcoin received a lot of publicity. That meant more people wanted to get in on the action, which increased demand — and thus increased the value of bitcoin.

You can engage in trend trading over any period of time, whether that’s days, weeks, months or years.

You just need to have an idea of what will happen next.

For that purpose, you can use technical analysis to help make an educated guess. Some of the indicators in technical analysis include relative strength index (RSI) and moving averages over time.

Although trend trading can seem less risky than other strategies, it’s worth remembering that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of factors that influence the price of bitcoin. These include businesses adopting bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies entering the market and governments implementing new trading regulations.

4. Breakout Trading

Breakout trading is similar to trend trading; the difference is that you aim to buy or sell bitcoin at the beginning or end of a trend.

You need to understand support and resistance levels, which are often referred to as the floor (support) of the bitcoin price graph and the ceiling (resistance). In other words, these are the price points bitcoin won’t drop below or rise above.

The points at which those levels are broken either upward or downward are called “the breakout points.” Once this happens, you can usually expect the price to become very volatile.

Again, the trick is to correctly anticipate what will happen next.

If you’re able to do that, then you can make some really good deals. There are different ways to identify the support and resistance levels, including to look at volume levels, RSI or the moving average. Once you know that, you can create an order to buy or sell at a specific price point that makes sense.

As with the other three strategies we’ve covered, breakout trading is not without risk. So even though you’re able to create an automated buy or sell order, it’s wise to keep a close eye on the market movements rather than to remain passive.

What to Know Before You Trade Bitcoin

Before you dive headfirst into bitcoin trading, there are some last points we need to touch on. As mentioned, it’s easy to get started with bitcoin but not as easy to become a master of the art.

1. Research Your Chosen Trading Strategy

There is more to each of the four trading strategies than we’ve covered in this guide. Make sure that you do proper research before you commit to any of them.

Fortunately, there are many resources online, including e-books, e-courses and videos that will teach you how to trade bitcoin.

Just remember that none of the strategies, regardless of how popular they are, come without risk.

2. Create A Bitcoin Trading Plan

Once you know which strategy you want to pursue, you should create a trading plan. Just like any other business venture, it’s important to have your criteria for success and failure in place.

Without a plan, you could become the victim of your own greed for more or fear of losing. The plan should include realistic goals for how much you hope to make and a risk profile that includes how much you’re willing to invest or lose.

3. Make Sure You Mitigate Any Risks

We’ve mentioned risk a few times now, and there’s a good reason for that.

All trade, whether it’s stock trading or bitcoin trading, involves a certain element of risk. One of the main risk factors in bitcoin trading is the volatility of the bitcoin price.

One of the ways you can mitigate risk is to put limit-close and stop-loss orders in place. That way, you can secure any profits or limit any losses before the market gets out of hand.

4. Find A Safe and Reliable Bitcoin Exchange

Finally, you should carefully consider your options when it comes to bitcoin exchanges. Not all exchanges are equally fast and safe to use, so we recommend you do your research.

NordikCoin is a convenient and secure bitcoin exchange. We enable you to buy and sell within minutes so you don’t lose out on a good opportunity.

But remember to do some further research, and don’t be afraid to reach out to us at NordikCoin if you need some extra advice on how to open an account.","Uniswap, a widely-used non-custodial digital asset exchange, has revealed that the decentralized protocol’s second iteration will launch during Q2 2020. It will add new features such as support for additional ERC-20 compliant pairs, more peer to peer price oracles, flash swaps and a new protocol charge mechanism.

Uniswap’s trading volume has been growing steadily. The decentralized exchange (DEX) reported a 192% increase in trading activity from the beginning of this year. Uniswap has handled more than $380 million in crypto token trades during this time period.

As confirmed in a March 23, 2020 announcement, the Uniswap development team expects the exchange’s second version to be ready for launch during the second quarter of this year.

At present, the factory and an initial blockchain-enabled smart contract are currently running on several major test networks, including Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan, and Görli (for developer testing purposes).

The announcement confirmed that Uniswap version 1 will “continue to work for as long as Ethereum exists.”

One of the main features of Uniswap version 2 is its ability to “pool” any two ERC-20 (Ethereum) crypto tokens together.

Uniswap’s current version 1 limits users to being able to only swap an ERC-20 token with Ether (ETH). The newly developed feature will let users “maintain more diverse ERC-20 token denominated positions, without mandatory exposure to ETH.”

The stablecoin Dai and Circle and Coinbase’s USDC pair is a fairly stable pair that may be useful for trading. Allowing these types of pairs should help reduce trading fees, because traders wanting to swap between two ERC-20 tokens will not have to route via ETH.

The Uniswap team explained:

“If two ERC-20 tokens are not paired directly, and do not have a common pair between them, they can still be swapped as long as a path between them exists. Router contracts can be used to optimize between direct and multi-step swaps.”

Uniswap version 2 will aim to improve the exchange’s existing price feed model. The team says that Uniswap version 1 “cannot be used safely as a price oracle because the price can move significantly in a short period of time.”

The second version of Uniswap will quote the latest market price for token pairs at the beginning of every block, which should make it costly for hackers to exploit the price feed.

Key Takeaways Binance traders can now buy and sell crypto via a widget in Brave Browser.

The move may help both demographics of user to interact with crypto.

All data, for browsers and traders alike, will be kept private, reads the press release.

Privacy-focused browser Brave has partnered with cryptocurrency exchange Binance to enable its users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly from their desktop browser.

Brave Introduces Binance Widget on Desktop Browser

Brave, the company behind the eponymous privacy-focused browser, has announced its partnership with Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.

In a press release shared with Crypto Briefing, the company said that Brave users will be able to trade digital assets through Binance without leaving the browser.

The desktop version of the browser will feature a Binance widget on the new tab page, which will offer integrated functionality for trading bitcoin.

The widget will allow users to access both Binance.com, the exchange’s global platform, and Binance.US, a platform that services U.S.-based clients.

“The Binance widget on Brave’s privacy-oriented browser instills a safer way to buy and sell crypto and also reduces user friction to onboard, trade and interact with the Binance ecosystem,” said Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance.

Privacy-Preserving Binance Gateway

The Binance widget will come with various options, enabling users to manage cryptocurrencies, including buying, depositing, trading, and viewing asset summaries.

Users can also trade major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and XRP, as well as all other coins supported by Binance.

Privacy-conscious users can rest assured that their data will remain private. Brave explained that the widget is built into the browser and is not a remotely embedded document. API calls will only be made into Binance if the user authenticates via OAuth and interacts with the widget.

The early version of the Binance widget is available in Brave Nightly, the browser’s beta testing version, while the full feature will be released to all users in April.

Brendan Eich, the CEO, and co-founder of Brave, said that bringing a leading exchange like Binance directly into the browser will allow the company to take cryptocurrency trading mainstream.

“Cryptocurrency trading can be a daunting task for users not familiar with such assets, so integrating Binance into the Brave browser makes the process seamless and simple,” Eich said in the announcement.","In brief:

According to a new report, the Binance futures platform has eclipsed BitMex in 24-hour trade volume.

At its peak, Binance Futures managed an all-time-high of $9 Billion in Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts in a day.

Binance has continually kept building and being a few steps ahead of the competition.

In a tweet a few days ago, the Vice President of the Binance Futures platform, Aaron Gong, announced that the platform was now leading in terms of the volume of Bitcoin (BTC) contracts traded in a 24 hour period. Mr. Gong went on to thank users of the platform who have made this feat possible.

$2.3 Billion in 24hr Trade Volume, Eclipsing Bitmex

The exchange went on to release a full report explaining that the platform’s BTC perpetual contract was averaging $2.343 Billion in 24-hour trade volume compared to Bitmex’s $2.121 Billion in a similar time frame. At one point, Binance successfully handled $9 Billion worth of Bitcoin contracts in a day.

Rapid Growth of the Binance Futures Platform

Launched in September 2019, the Binance futures platform currently has 24 USDT contracts covering major digital assets such as BTC, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, Dash, Link and more. Such a variety has allowed the exchange to host half of all the top 10 most liquid altcoin contracts. (Also to note, is that in September 2019, the exchange acquired JEX: a crypto derivatives trading platform.) Mr. Gong is quoted as explaining that the trustworthiness of Binance is the reason for its accelerated growth.

Since our inception, it has been an exciting time for traders as crypto markets displayed stronger demand and volatility. Therefore, choosing a reliable and trustworthy exchange for risk-hedging has never been more critical than before. Hopefully, Binance Futures emerge as the market-standard choice for traders as we continue to expand our ecosystem throughout 2020.

Additionally, Binance has one of the lowest trading fee structure available in the crypto-verse as well as a considerably stable and quick matching engine.

A response to crypto taxation around the world

The new option comes in response to growing crypto adoption, as well as new requirements from regulators around the world making cryptocurrency owners report on their holdings. Thus, last summer, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began asking digital currency holders to amend their tax filings, while compelling others to pay back taxes and interest and penalties.

At the time, the IRS said that it was focused “on enforcing the law and helping taxpayers fully understand and meet their obligations."" Last October, the IRS issued its guidelines for crypto-based tax reporting, requiring roughly 150 million American taxpayers to answer the question whether they received, sold, sent or exchanged any virtual currency.

At the same time, most members of the European Union have a radically different approach to tax codes to govern their respective crypto sectors. For example, in Germany, Bitcoin (BTC) is not subject to any capital gains tax, thereby allowing investors to avoid paying significant levies on their holdings if the value of their BTC appreciates.",
2020-03-25,"During 2019 alone, thousands of merchants worldwide were accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment method. Despite this, a lot of current and would-be merchants are confused about how to pay taxes on their cryptocurrency sales.

This guide was created by a United States business owner that advocates for cryptocurrency and a crypto tax expert to cover both practical aspects and tax tips for businesses that wish to accept cryptocurrencies. So whether your clients are asking or you desire to support the growth of the crypto ecosystem, here is the right way to do it.

Cryptocurrency tax law varies by country

Each country has its own tax rules. Some, such as Portugal and France, look favorably on cryptocurrencies, while others like the U.S. and the United Kingdom take a more conservative approach to the asset.

Related: Around the World in 2019 — A Landmark Year for Crypto Taxation

Use the guide above to understand the implications in your country. Keep in mind that a country may use one set of laws for individuals and another for businesses. For example, in Portugal, the laws are more advantageous for individuals.

The rules can also differ from one business to another. In some countries, there are different tax rules for self-employers, companies, corporations and small businesses.

In the U.S., when you receive virtual currency in exchange for performing services, whether you perform the services as an employee or not, you recognize ordinary income. For more information on compensation for services, see Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income.

Make sure you understand whether the current tax rules apply to your business. If you are not sure what rules apply to you, consult a local tax professional.

You may be able to eliminate the volatility of crypto

The volatility of crypto is an issue that affects everyone who ever considers paying with crypto, but if you have a business, you need to take a moment and think about the implications.

There are two main ways to combat volatility. First, accept cryptocurrency payments through third-party service providers like BitPay.

For a fee (as low as 1% in the U.S.), you can instantly get fiat whenever someone is paying you with crypto. Most of those companies are also taking care of the invoicing and record-keeping procedures and dealing with the mandatory Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer requirements.

Taxwise, this option is also very easy: If the crypto is immediately converted into fiat, you are paying tax for regular business income.

The main disadvantage of these companies is that they cannot provide services to everyone. Depending on the type of company and your jurisdiction, you may not be eligible for these services.

The second way to deal with volatility is to either accept stablecoins or instantly convert other cryptocurrencies to stablecoins.

If you choose this way, you will need to issue the invoice for the payment yourself. There are some bookkeeping platforms that support crypto payments, such as Coinbase Commerce.

Since stablecoins are not entirely nonvolatile, when you sell the stablecoins, you will need to check your tax implications, which depend on you and your business’s country of tax residency.

Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get to the practical aspects.

Record every sale

The first step is easier than you think. For every sale, you need to record the sale date and transaction amount as you would for fiat.

If you use a service like BitPay that instantly converts 100% of the sale to fiat currency, then you are done. Record the final amount minus the transaction fee. Same as you would for a payment processor.

If you do not use third-party payment services, in addition to the fiat amount, make sure to record fair market value amount in crypto. For reference, $50 USD at the time of writing this article is 0.0058 BTC.

Fair market value, or FMV, is typically defined as the selling price for an item to which a buyer and seller can agree.

Cryptocurrency value is determined by the cryptocurrency exchange and recorded in U.S. dollars. However, when it comes to peer-to-peer transactions or other transactions not facilitated by an exchange, the FMV is determined by the date and time at which the transaction was recorded on the blockchain.

The amount of income you must report is the fair market value of the virtual currency in USD when received. In an on-chain transaction, you receive the virtual currency on the date and at the time the transaction is recorded on the distributed ledger.

Additionally, you will need to determine the cost basis for the crypto you have received.

Cost basis is the original value of an asset for tax purposes. For digital currencies, the cost basis is the amount you spent to acquire the digital currency, including fees, brokerage commissions from exchanges, and other acquisition costs in U.S. dollars.

If you provided someone with services and received digital currency in exchange, your basis in that digital currency is the fair market value of the digital currency in U.S. dollars when it is received. For more information on basis, see Publication 551, Basis of Assets.

The Internal Revenue Code and regulations require taxpayers to maintain records that are sufficient to establish the positions taken on tax returns.

For cryptocurrency payments, it means documenting receipts, sales, exchanges or other dispositions of digital currency as well as the fair market value of the digital currency at the time of transaction.

Cashing out

Now it’s time to “cash-out” into fiat. Because the BTC price fluctuates, each sale has a unique value in BTC.

We send the 0.0269 BTC to an exchange and sell it for 290 USD. There is a 40 USD gain due to appreciation of the Bitcoin price.

When you earn money between the time of sale and the crypto-fiat conversion, you probably need to pay capital gains tax.

It depends on the country, but in the United States, we would calculate the time between the initial sale and the crypto-to-fiat conversion.

In our example and most others, the crypto-to-fiat trade that occurred within 12 months of the crypto purchases will be considered short-term capital gains.

If you decided to hold your crypto for over a year, then the profit would be considered long-term capital gains.

Many people don’t know it, but cryptocurrency tax liability can be significantly reduced by crypto tax planning. The new IRS guidance enables you to plan your taxes by choosing which particular Bitcoin to sell.

Related: New IRS Tax Guidance Targets Crypto, and US Persons Who Use It

Therefore, you can choose to sell the same Bitcoin you purchased when the price was high now at a lower price. This can assist you in optimizing your tax liability. This tax planning method calls for the use of specific identification, a common way to calculate and plan taxes in many countries.

What about the miscellaneous transaction and withdrawal fees?

This one is straightforward. They are considered expenses, just like traditional banking or processing fees. The fees will reduce your cost basis.

What about crypto refunds?

Let’s say a customer wants to return an item and is granted a full refund. Bitcoin has gone up since its purchase. Do we refund their original amount of Bitcoin or the current USD equivalent?

This is usually a case-by-case decision, but most businesses will refund the USD equivalent at the time of purchase because the unit of account is (almost) always in fiat currency.

No matter what you choose to do, make sure you report it correctly and reduce the tax calculation consistently. Keep all fair market value records of the payment receipts and the refund.

We hope you have a bit more clarity on the tax implications for your business. Pay attention to updates as crypto tax regulations evolve in the 2020s.

This article was co-authored by Or Lokay Cohen and Matt Aaron.","A key measure of competition among Bitcoin miners just dropped by 15.95 percent – the second-largest decline in the network’s history.

The drop in so-called mining difficulty signals some miners have bowed out of the ongoing race to solve math problems to win freshly minted bitcoin (BTC), as a decline in the cryptocurrency’s price has made this activity less profitable. That said, the drop could work in favor for those who have chosen to stay in the game as less competition means individual miners would gain a bigger cut in Bitcoin’s daily mining output.

The world’s largest blockchain network by market capitalization adjusted its mining difficulty around 3:00 UTC on March 26 to 13.91 trillion (T), down from 16.55 T in the previous cycle recorded on March 9. Two weeks ago, bitcoin suffered its worst sell-off in seven years, and it has only partially recovered since.

Mining requires powerful, specialized computers that consume copious amounts of electricity, and these businesses typically pay those hefty bills by selling or borrowing against their bitcoin.

The price drop has erased all gains in Bitcoin’s computing power from the last three months, pushing it back to the level seen around Dec. 20. The situation was weighing especially on mining operators that have been running with older equipment such as Bitmain’s AntMiner S9 and other equivalent models.

The third-biggest drop in Bitcoin mining difficulty was 15.13 percent, recorded in December 2018 amid a price crash at the time. The largest difficulty percentage drop in Bitcoin history dates back to October 2011.

Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is programmed to adjust itself every 2,016 blocks – which normally takes about 14 days – in order to keep the average block production interval at about 10 minutes.

See also: How Bitcoin Mining Works

When a sizable amount of computing power on the network has been switched off during a 14-day cycle, it increases the time for remaining miners to produce the 2,016 blocks. As such, the bitcoin network would make it less difficult to mine in the next cycle.

Similarly, if a significant amount of processing power has plugged into the network in any cycle, shortening the average block production interval, the network will increase its difficulty in the next cycle. As a result, individual miners would generate less bitcoin since competition has intensified.

Bad timing

What has worsened the situation for mining operators in the last 17 days is that mining difficulty had reached an all-time high on March 9 – just a few days before the March 12 price crash – and yet still more than two weeks away before it could adjust itself.

The recent price plunge, coupled with record mining competition at the time, had made more than two dozen old bitcoin mining models unable to generate daily profits in the past two weeks, according to data from mining pool f2pool, assuming electricity cost is at an average $0.05 per kilowatt-hour.

The total average computing power generated by all the mining equipment on the bitcoin network over the past two weeks has also declined from 118 exahashes per second (EH/s) in early March to now about 99 EH/s.

Chris Zhu, co-founder and COO of Chinese mining pool PoolIn said on March 12, following the price plunge, that he expected the network’s hash rate to drop by 20 to 30 percent in the next weeks, based on the hash rate decline on several major mining pools at the time.

And that has led to the increase of the average block production interval to nearly 12 minutes, subsequently prolonging the adjustment period to 17 days, meaning incumbent miner operators had to wait three more days than usual before they could mine more bitcoin while still having to pay electricity costs.

That said, with the significant mining difficulty drop in the current cycle and bitcoin’s price bouncing back above $6,600, older mining equipment like Bitmain’s AntMiner S9 is able to bring modest daily profits again, according to PoolIn’s data.

Meanwhile, the latest and most powerful miners delivered by Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan since late 2019 continue to generate profits as they boast a higher mining efficiency.","Privacy Browser Brave Integrates Cryptocurrency Trading Through Binance

The number of Brave users has steadily grown over the years. With only 1 million monthly active users at the beginning of 2018, the privacy browser is now used by more than 12 million monthly active users and over 500,000 verified publishers, the company said on Tuesday. “The Brave browser combines privacy with a blockchain-based digital advertising platform, and offers 3-6x faster browsing than other browsers,” Brave claims.

The browser allows its users to “opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with Basic Attention Tokens they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators.”

The Privacy Browser With Tor Integration

An increasing number of people are looking for the best privacy browser or the most secure browser to protect their activities online. Brave is one of several browsers that aim to deliver privacy when browsing the internet.

For added privacy, the Onion Routing network Tor has been integrated into the Brave browser. “Private Tabs with Tor help protect Brave users from ISPs (Internet Service Providers), guest Wi-Fi providers, and visited sites that may be watching their Internet connection or even tracking and collecting IP addresses, a device’s Internet identifier,” Brave detailed. As for the newly added cryptocurrency trading functionality, Brave explained in its Tuesday announcement:

The Binance widget is built into Brave and is not a loaded iframe (remotely embedded document), which preserves the user’s privacy. API calls will only be made into Binance if the user authenticates via OAuth and interacts with the widget.

But a failure to set a higher high and a fall to new lows puts Ethereum back into a downtrend that one analyst says is going to lead to even deeper new lows and possible final capitulation before the altcoin rises once again.

ETH/USD Downtrend Continues, Capitulation and New Lows Coming

During the 2017 crypto hype bubble, it wasn’t just Bitcoin soaking up all of the limelight. Ethereum was also experiencing extreme growth in value on the heels of the initial coin offering boom.

Investors were buying up Ether feverishly and exchanging it for access to early launch phase cryptocurrencies built as ERC-20 tokens launched on Ethereum’s protocol.

The asset eventually reached an all-time high for over $1,400.

Since then, however, the asset is down over 90% from its all-time high, and after a glimmer of hope at the start of the year that a higher low was being put in – a sign an uptrend is beginning – it only led to yet another lower high, and a new, lower low followed.

Setting a continued sequence of lower highs and lower lows is the definition of a downtrend, and few assets fit this definition as well as Ethereum against the dollar.

Until Ethereum breaks back above $150 and holds it as support, one crypto analyst sees very little reason to expect higher ETH prices in the days to come.

$ETH The USD pair looks even worse.

ETH dropped by 90%+ and is now ranging putting in lower highs and lower lows.

Ethereum Must Reclaim This Line Against Bitcoin To Be Bullish

While Ethereum is clearly locked in a downtrend against the dollar, it isn’t fairing so well against Bitcoin, either.

The leading altcoin across the market has lost an important support line against the number one cryptocurrency, and until it can reclaim that level, the same crypto analyst as above says to expect new lows and possible “capitulation” in Ethereum investors on the ETH/BTC trading pair.

Because Ethereum had so strongly performed against Bitcoin at the start of 2020, the crypto market was convinced a new alt season was starting – a period of time where altcoins like Ethereum outperform the first-ever cryptocurrency.

Related Reading | Analyst: Ethereum Prepares for Massive 95% Move Against BTC, But Which Direction?

And with altcoins so oversold, and Ethereum often leading altcoin rallies against Bitcoin, all the signs had been pointing to an incoming alt season.

But the selloff that caused the crypto market to collapse earlier this month hit altcoins like Ethereum and others far harder than Bitcoin was hit, causing the asset’s trading pairs to heavily favor BTC.

Until Ethereum can reclaim that line, Bitcoin is bound to outperform the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap for the foreseeable future.

Featured image from Shutterstock","Bitcoin has experienced wild price swings in recent days as cryptocurrency markets respond to the global economic uncertainty sparked by the coronavirus epidemic.

The cryptocurrency has swung between highs of $9,000 and lows of 4,000 since the start of March, representing the most severe price volatility since the market explosion and subsequent crash in late 2017.

Over the last week the value of one bitcoin has risen by more than $1,000 to its current price of $6,600.

The latest price rise came after the US Federal Reserve announced unlimited quantitative easing measures to help reduce the economic impact of coronavirus.

This follows similar announcements from other central banks like the Reserve Bank of Australia and the European Central Bank to artificially increase the money supply.

Such drastic economic policy is seen by some analysts as a potential opportunity for investors, who may consider bitcoin as a safe-haven asset due to its decentralised nature.

The limited supply of bitcoin – only 21 million will ever exist – means it is also immune to quantitative easing and other emergency monetary measures that fiat currencies are susceptible to.

“The US Federal Reserve’s announcement effectively pumps billions of dollars into the market, so some investors may be weary that the dollar will lose its value, and are moving back into bitcoin to hedge against inflation,” Simon Peters, a cryptocurrency analyst at the online trading platform eToro, told The Independent.

“Because the amount of new bitcoin that comes on to the market decreases over time, it is by design a deflationary asset when compared with a fiat currency like the US dollar. In theory the value per bitcoin should increase over time.”

Other major cryptocurrencies continue to experience similar fluctuations, though the full extent of the impact the coronavirus outbreak has had on markets is yet to be fully realised.

Bitcoin was launched in 2009 in response to the financial crisis of the previous year, offering a revolutionary alternative to the traditional financial system.

The electronic cash system has failed to achieve mainstream adoption in the subsequent years, during which the global economy recovered and achieved sustained growth. Some experts believe that the advent of another economic collapse could be see a renewed interest in bitcoin as an alternative form of currency and store of value.

“This is the first time the world has faced a financial crisis when there has been an alternative financial system,” said Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of London-based cryptocurrency exchange Luno.

“Cryptocurrencies are still very young, and at this stage in their development cannot replace fiat currencies, but as the problems global markets face increase we will see investors looking at digital assets as a way of distancing themselves from digital investments.”","Bitcoin Exchange South Korean Crypto Exchanges Aid Police in Child Porn Investigation

South Korea’s four major cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit, reportedly stated that they would support the local police in investigating the so-called “nth rooms” phenomenon, which turned into a nation-wide scandal.

Crypto Exchanges Reportedly Said Celebrities Were Users

For years, dozens of South Korean middle school girls, and sometimes boys, were filmed performing violent sexual acts and self-harm. The videos were then shared through Telegram chat rooms in exchange for payments made in cryptocurrency.

The Korean police found dozens of victims since the videos often displayed girls’ names and addresses.

After more than 5 million Koreans signed petitions to name the man who led the group that blackmailed girls and created the Telegram groups, the police decided to reveal his identity. The name of the 24 year old criminal is Cho Ju-bin.

The police also revealed that over 10,000 people used the Telegram chatrooms, with some paying over $1,200 in crypto for gaining access. So far, the police know about 74 people, including 16 minor girls, who had been exploited.

Elsewhere, reporters of local media agency Kookmin Ilbo discovered about 25,000 users across 30 such Telegram chat rooms.

Other estimates from local media claim that there were up to 300,000 paying customers using similar chat rooms.

As he was moved away from a police station in Seoul, Cho said:

I apologise to those who were hurt by me. […] Thank you for putting a brake on the life of a devil that could not be stopped.

Nevertheless, he didn’t comment when reporters asked if he admitted to the allegations.

He is charged with abuse, threats and coercion, and violating the sexual abuse act, the child protection act, and the privacy act.

Although the police haven’t confirmed it yet, there are reports that a local crypto exchange traced the crypto transactions and found out that some of the fee-paying members were popular artists, professors, sports celebrities, and startup founders and company CEOs.

Who is Cho Ju-bin and How Did the Chatrooms Operate?

The child porn suspect is a 24 year old man nicknamed “baksa,” which translates as “doctor” or “guru.” He managed the Telegram chat rooms where videos of child abuse were shared in exchange for payments. Cho charged the viewers in crypto, which made it difficult for the police to trace and shut down the chat rooms. However, given that South Korean law requires all crypto exchange clients to pass through KYC/AML verification procedures, the platform could help authorities find members and understand the magnitude of the incident.

So far, the police have tracked down 124 individuals related to the case. Cho and 17 others have been detained.

Korean newspaper, Kookmin Ilbo, said that each of the eight “nth rooms” shared videos from three to four girls who had been blackmailed. The girls were lured by chatroom operators who promised modeling or escort jobs.

Crypto Has Previously Been Praised by Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein

While it’s not the problem of the crypto space, it is not the first instance when criminals prefer or praise Bitcoin and its brethren.

Billionaire and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was in the middle of a sex slave scandal that involved sex trafficking among many other horrific crimes, praised Bitcoin and the technology underpinning it.

Interestingly, last year, MIT’s Media Lab director Joichi Ito was forced to resign after the New Yorker revealed that he attempted to hide financial contributions from Epstein. But besides managing MIT’s lab, Ito also set up the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) at MIT, helping Bitcoin go through some of its most difficult days in 2015.

At the time, when nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation experienced “funding constraints,” the DCI offered full-time positions to Bitcoin core developers, including Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields, and Wladimir van der Laan.

Crypto invoicing feature introduced to Crypto.com

Paying with cryptocurrencies is slowly beginning to look a lot like paying with credit cards, thanks to companies that introduce user-friendly innovations to their platforms. Crypto.com, a payments and cryptocurrency platform, has announced the launch of an invoicing feature.

According to the company’s blog post, the feature will be available to merchants on the Crypto.com Pay platform and allow them to generate and send invoices to customers who wish to pay for their goods or services with cryptocurrencies.

While merchants on the Crypto.com platform will have the items listed on an invoice priced in fiat currency, the recipients of the invoice will be able to settle the payment in the coin of their choice. Buyers can settle invoices using the Crypto Pay feature in the Crypto.com App, the company said, adding that the payment amount will be converted into the fiat currency of the merchant’s choice. The company said:

“The fiat amount converted is fixed to eliminate the risk of price fluctuation in cryptocurrencies.”

The platform currently supports invoice settlement in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Crypto.com Coin (CRO)

Paying with cryptocurrencies becoming the new norm

This isn’t the first time Crypto.com has announced features that promote crypto payments. Last week, the company introduced a rewards program that incentivizes users to use its gift-cards. According to the company’s blog post, customers using their gift cards to pay for essential items such as groceries or food delivery will be able to earn back double the amount of the company’s Pay Rewards.

Apart from Crypto.com, other companies have also been working on their own invoicing solutions. Earlier this month, cryptocurrency payments provider NetCents introduced a recurrent billing feature. The company’s full-service invoicing suite is aimed at providing a complete merchant experience to its users.

OpenNode has also introduced crypto invoices this month, allowing users to send bills with professional, itemized invoices. German startup Shelli.io launched an IOTA invoicing and accounting software last month.

CEO and co-founder Kris Marszalek told CoinDesk that transaction volumes on Crypto.com more than doubled between December and February, with app downloads also hitting all-time highs. “We saw a million users on our platform last September, and we continue to grow on a monthly basis in double-digit terms,” he said.

Based in Hong Kong, Crypto.com provides app-based trading services as well as crypto payment solutions through a Visa-powered bank card. When it was known as Monaco, the company raised a total of $26.7 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. It changed its name to Crypto.com after purchasing the domain name for a reported $10 million in 2018.

Marszalek says the recent robust growth could be a response to the radical steps central banks are taking to stabilize financial markets. In the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the Federal Reserve on Monday launched quantitative easing (QE) with scope to purchase an unlimited amount of Treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities to prop up the U.S. financial system.

“People are very interested in crypto in this challenging time,” Marszalek said, adding that digital assets could offer investors an independent store of value and a possible hedge against the possible side-effects of QE.

Retail investors continued to use the Crypto.com platform even when the market tanked less than two weeks, he added: “People view this as a buying opportunity.”

Other platforms, too, experienced runaway volumes in recent weeks. Brian Norton, COO of MyEtherWallet, said there were now more people buying ether (ETH) on its platform than ever before. “We have never seen these numbers, not even during the big crash in winter 2018,” he added.

Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley said her firm had had “unprecedented trading volumes” with a particular interest in stablecoins and bitcoin (BTC). “Bitcoin’s recent jump while the rest of the market tumbles proves that unlike traditional companies, Bitcoin can and will survive without bailouts,” she said.

While Crypto.com would not disclose precise numbers, a spokesperson said March 2020 saw record trading volumes on the platform at levels three times higher than in December 2019.","The $2 trillion stimulus deal in the U.S. wasn’t enough to keep many cryptocurrencies from taking a dip Wednesday. Bitcoin (BTC) was down a more than 1 percent over the past 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC, and only NEO (NEO) was a gainer, up by less than 1 percent.

Ether (ETH) is down 2 percent. Other cryptocurrencies flashing red on the CoinDesk digital asset board include dogecoin (DOGE) in the doghouse by 3 percent and Dash (DASH) also in the red by 3 percent.

Gold is down slightly on the day as of 20:00 UTC. “A devaluation of global currencies and long-term negative rates are both very positive for gold,” InfiniGold’s Deane noted.

2020-03-26,"Key Takeaways The most recent crash in Bitcoin's price meant some miners took their machines offline.

This has resulted in a drop in BTC's mining difficulty.

A drop in difficulty also means it could be more profitable for the most recent dropouts to finally return.

Share this article

Bitcoin’s price is down over 35% from its peak in February 2020. This decrease has adversely impacted mining profitability, forcing some farms to take their hardware offline. Mining difficulty has since dropped 16%, offering solace to Bitcoin miners.

Miners Adjust After Price Crash

Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has been steadily increasing since 2013. Mining farms have been aggressively adding capacity over this period, pushing BTC’s hash rate and difficulty up. However, with two large price crashes in the span of two years, miners are under financial duress.

Some of these farms took older hardware offline as their profitability turned negative with a lower Bitcoin price. The Bitcoin network has automatic difficulty adjustments to compensate for this reduction in computing power.

The mining difficulty increases in times when miners are adding capacity. But in times like this, when Bitcoin miners take some machines off the network, difficulty needs to decrease so the mining incentive can adjust.

Overall sentiment in the mining industry is still positive despite macro concerns stemming from the coronavirus and possible global recession. Experts believe mining farms will continue to add capacity for the foreseeable future.

Today's mining difficulty adjustment is expected to be the 3rd largest downward adjustment in Bitcoin's history. Interesting to note, three out of the last four largest downward adjustments marked local bottoms. Source: https://t.co/Ymk8PGFkoj pic.twitter.com/3DWcU85O8S — Max Brrrronstein (@max_bronstein) March 25, 2020

Bitcoin just witnessed a 16% decrease in mining difficulty. This drop will offer a boost to existing Bitcoin miners, who will now need less computing power to achieve the same probability of mining a coin. This adjustment will increase their revenue, and possibly even cause them to increase capacity.

Block times have been affected by a combination of high difficulty and lower miner input. Bitcoin blocks were being mined either too slow or too fast. Yesterday, there were just three blocks mined in three hours. And earlier today, there were nine blocks mined in one hour. This resulted in block times of one hour and seven minutes, respectively.

Hash rate has dropped from 136 EH/s to 75 EH/s since the beginning of March, per Blockchain.com data. Older machines, which accounted for a lot of the computing power, may have been taken offline en masse by mining farms. Nevertheless, computing power is expected to move back up, thanks to the reduction in mining difficulty.

Another indirect impact is a delay in the halving. Bitcoin’s block reward is cut in half every 210,000 blocks. The third halving, from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC per block, will be implemented at block 630,000.

With slower block times, a delay in the halving was imminent. However, with the difficulty adjustment kicking in early, the delay will be reduced to a few days or weeks at most.","While bitcoin (BTC) looks set to prolong its recent bullish moves, those responsible for making new bitcoin have increased their selling.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value rose from $3,867 to $7,000 in the 13 days to March 25, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Yet, throughout the 81 percent recovery rally, miners sold more coins than what they generated, according to the miner’s rolling inventory (MRI) figure, a measure created by crypto data company ByteTree to track the changes in inventory levels held by miners.

The 21-day rolling MRI stayed above 100 during the entire duration of the recent recovery from lows below $4,000. An MRI above 100 means miners are selling more than they mine and running down inventory, while a below-100 MRI reading indicates miners are amassing inventory by selling less than they mine.

Because prices continued to go up, there was more than enough appetite for the bitcoin the miners fed the market.

See also: Bitcoin Is a Safe Haven for a Worse Storm Than This

Mining pools account for the highest percentage of bitcoin flowing into exchanges and have significant influence on prices. Yet, some view the market’s reaction as a positive indicator.

“When the price of bitcoin can rally sharply from the local lows and buyers can absorb the extra bitcoin sold by the miners with little impact, it is a sign of strength in the overall market,” Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data told CoinDesk.

Miners also ran down inventory on Wednesday, as noted by ByteTree founder and Chairman Charlie Morris.

“Miners sold 2,788 against 1,588 mined, slamming the market, yet the market takes it. This is bullish,” Morris tweeted during Wednesday’s European trading hours. The cryptocurrency dropped from $6,700 to $6,500 during the Asian session, possibly on miner selling, but reversed losses later in the day.

Other analysts, however, are of the opinion that one-day variances in net miner sales are often too small to make a valid judgement of the bullishness of the market.

“Wednesday’s sell volume of 2,788 wasn’t statistically significant enough to have much meaning on the larger bitcoin price movements.” said Alexander S. Blum, COO at fintech company Two Prime. “Compared to the amount of Bitcoins in the world, the miner sales were less than 1 percent,”

Yet because miners on average have sold more coins during the price recovery, it may be indicative of underlying market strength. To put it another way, the price rally looks to have legs.

Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to bouts of risk aversion in traditional markets. Global equities have regained some poise over the past couple of days, mainly due to the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus unveiled by the U.S.

The coronavirus outbreak, however, is showing no signs of slowing down and markets are yet to get a true sense of the economic damage, which could be far bigger than what’s widely forecasted. For example, the U.S. initial jobless claims soared past three million in the week ending March 21, double economists’ expectations for 1.5 million new claims.

Not surprisingly, that has some expected dire predictions from certain corners of the market.

“If you think what’s happening now is the economic crisis, you’re wrong,” renowned gold bug (and crypto skeptic) Peter Schiff tweeted early Thursday. “This is the health crisis. The economic crisis is the one that follows, and will result from the fiscal and monetary cure. The crisis will not just be worse than the Great Recession, but the Great Depression.”","UPDATE 15:00 UTC: Binance has officially announced the Binance Card, stating that ""The Binance Card is issued by Visa and accepted by more than 46 million merchants in 200 regions and territories, which makes shopping with crypto easier than ever before.""

""The Binance Card does everything a regular payment card does, plus much more. It works like a regular debit card issued by your bank – which, in this case, is your Binance.com account. You simply top-up your card with funds through the Binance Card App in the form of Bitcoin or BNB, and you're ready to go. It's as simple as transferring BNB from one wallet to another,"" the blog post explained.

""The Binance Card is currently available as a virtual card in a Beta version, with a physical card coming shortly,"" the post further explained.

Binance is working toward the launch of a crypto debit card, The Block has learned.

A source close to Binance provided The Block with a link to the crypto debit card's website. The site offers ""A Crypto Debit Card for The World.""

The website, GetBinanceCard.com, is advertising the Binance Card, which it says will let users ""load your favourite cryptocurrencies into your Binance card wallet and spend at any VISA merchants worldwide."" The website was registered by Moon Tech Pty Ltd, which is registered in Queensland, Australia and was active as of February 22 of this year. WHOIS data indicates that the website was registered on January 22.

The site's privacy policy page details a list of types of personal information that may be collected during sign-up, notably mentioning that ""[y]ou may provide this information to us directly, or by signing in using a third party, including (but not limited to) your Binance account.""

It's unclear at this time which cryptocurrencies will be supported by the offered debit card, or in which countries it might be available for use. While the website includes a call-to-action to register interest, it currently provides no means for doing so. There is no known launch date.

A second website for the debit card service makes mention of the Australia-based company, but unlike the other website, it allows users to register interest. A privacy policy link reverts back to the GetBinanceCard.com site.

The card effort appears to be connected to a previously announced effort between Binance and TravelByBit, which received $2.5 million in funding from Binance in 2018, to create a crypto-backed travel rewards card. On March 12, TravelByBit said in a blog post that it was delaying some of the features of that card in order to move the product to market more quickly.

""With the hope of the card being widely adopted, the debit card will now be launched as the Binance Card and the best part is, you won’t need to wait much longer. From March 20th 2020 you can start the process simply by downloading the card app from the play store,"" the post said. ""Binancians will be able to use BNB to make purchases within their daily lives.""

In early 2016, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao took part in an Ask-Me-Anything session, during which was asked about a Binance-specific debit card. According to a published transcript, he said of the topic: ""We're not in a plan to offer a Binance credit or debit card just yet. We're working with other third-party partners to enable those. So yeah, we're looking for partners too, in those areas.""

Coinbase launched a similar initiative in April 2019 in the U.K. The debit card allows users to spend cryptocurrencies directly from their Coinbase accounts. The debit card is currently not available in the U.S., but accessible in 29 European countries. Coinbase's debit card supports ten coins, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP and DAI.

Earlier this month, Crypto.com announced that its MCO Visa Card had begun shipping to customers based in the United Kingdom.

(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. first-quarter delivery numbers blew past analysts’ estimates, helping the stock fend off a slide in the broader electric vehicle industry amid growing skepticism about the future of President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill.Shares of the Elon Musk-led company closed up 4.4% in New York, leaving it down 2.1% year to date. Over the past 12 months, the stock has advanced more than 600%. Other EV stocks like Workhorse Group Inc. and Lordstown Motors Corp. dropped on Monday.EV companies overall have received some good news in the past week, including a big push into electric vehicles in the infrastructure spending bill unveiled last week, and the estimate-crushing delivery figures from Tesla. But that may not be enough to stop a decline in the stocks that has seen investor interest wane this year. Auto stocks, EV and otherwise, have also been plagued by a global shortage of semiconductors.“The rhetoric around Biden’s infrastructure stimulus is what’s creating the weakness,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said in an interview, discussing the EV selloff. “There is low certainty this will pass as proposed,” the analyst said.However, the underperformance in EVs is probably misplaced, Irwin said, noting that both political parties like the domestic success story of Tesla and would welcome a revival of Detroit with EVs.Biden’s infrastructure bill has already started facing its challenges, with Republicans saying they want no part of the corporate tax hikes needed to pay for the plan and some progressive Democrats saying the package would not spend nearly enough.Most EV companies’ shares fell on Monday. Workhorse lost 6.4% and Lordstown Motors closed down 4%. Nikola Corp. tumbled 7.8%, while Fisker Inc. and XPeng Inc. both ended the day 2.5% lower.Tesla on Friday said it delivered 184,800 cars worldwide for the first quarter of the year, outpacing the 169,850 average of analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. While the company does not break out sales by geography, the U.S. and China are its largest markets and the company said it was “encouraged by the strong reception of the Model Y in China.”‘Sentiment Shifter’“These delivery numbers are a paradigm and sentiment shifter for the space going forward,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note, calling Tesla’s delivery numbers a “jaw dropper.”Models 3 and Y, which accounted for almost all of the sales in the period, are manufactured in Tesla’s plants in Fremont, California, and in Shanghai, China.“Receptivity to the Model Y in China was always a gray area in our minds since there was never disclosure on deposit/interest levels from Tesla,” Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne wrote in a note, adding that the strength in that country appeared to have driven sales.Several Wall Street analysts raised their estimates and price targets on Tesla after the sales results. JPMorgan Chase analyst Ryan Brinkman said its ability to produce roughly the same amount of vehicles in the first quarter as in the last three months of 2020, stands out in the industry, given global light vehicle production is estimated to have declined about 16% sequentially in the same period because of the chip shortage.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Crypto users who want to convert their Bitcoin (BTC) for Ether (ETH) currently have to use third-party exchanges. Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin is proposing a solution to ease the intricacies of swapping the two leading cryptocurrencies.

In a tweet, Buterin suggests building a bridge between BTC and ETH via a trustless and serverless decentralized exchange (DEX) where users can directly convert BTC to ETH and vice versa.

“We should put resources toward a proper (trustless, serverless, maximally Uniswap-like UX) ETH <-> BTC decentralized exchange. It’s embarrassing that we still can’t easily move between the two largest crypto ecosystems trustlessly.”

Buterin says the decentralized exchange is ideally similar to Uniswap, which facilitates automatic exchange between ETH and Ethereum-based tokens.

Unlike other exchanges, Uniswap does away with book order functionality and instead uses an automated market-making mechanism to guarantee liquidity. Buterin envisions a similar decentralized exchange that would allow users to swap between BTC and ETH with just a click of a button.

He says Bitcoin holders could swap the king coin for ETH to use Ethereum-based applications such as Maker DAO, Tornado.cash and smart contract wallets.

Buterin adds that DEX bridges should also be created to facilitate direct swaps between ETH and other crypto ecosystems. To jumpstart a dialog in the developer community, he says he has already spoken with Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, CEO of Electric Coin Company, the firm behind the cryptocurrency Zcash.

Developers across the cryptosphere highlight just how many different platforms are being built in an effort to create basic infrastructure that solves this type of demand. The team at Komodo, for example, points to AtomicDEX, a mobile-friendly atomic swap powered DEX that it says can do the job, effectively swapping the two cryptocurrencies.

The team at Komodo says they’re eager to collaborate with the Ethereum community.

Brave announced Tuesday it was partnering with Binance to develop an in-browser crypto trading tool that will ultimately let users deposit, swap, purchase and trade crypto right from Brave Browser’s launch and new tab windows. There, a natively-integrated crypto widget executes actions via Binance and Binance.US, depending on the user’s country.

Most of those features are not functional at launch, CoinDesk found. The widget is only accessible on Brave’s “Nightly” developer-stage browser, and as of Wednesday afternoon it is limited to booting up purchase orders through the Binance Fiat Gateway. Brave said a wider release is expected in April.

Brave’s CEO Brendan Eich declined to disclose the terms of the deal.

“Adding a widget that seamlessly helps users acquire and trade crypto is a natural evolution of our features,” Eich told CoinDesk. He said the “crypto-savvy” user base has been “clamoring” for a trade function to go along with Brave’s existing ethereum wallet.

Brave is working on mobile wallets and plans to expand it to other blockchains, he said.

Brave has been courting the crypto community for much of its existence as a privacy-centric alternative to other, more popular browser services. In 2017, it ran a $35 million ICO for its ERC-20 “Basic Attention Tokens,” now the backbone for the Brave Rewards ad views compensation system.

The addition of a trading tool puts Brave more squarely in the race with other crypto-focused browsers, like Opera, which holds over 2 percent market share according to statcounter (Brave’s privacy functions make it difficult to measure its slice of the pie).","American and European equity markets extended their gains on Thursday while major cryptocurrencies made only slight moves on the day.

“Looks like stimulus is short-term good for all assets, crypto included,” said Kevin Zhou, CEO of algorithmic trading firm Galois Capital.

Indeed, while stimulus appears to be keeping markets up, longer-term economic troubles loom. U.S. industrial output has already taken a significant hit as coronavirus and government-mandated business closures hit crucial economic engines.

On March 24, IHS Markit released its monthly report on the composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI). PMI tracks the overall health of the U.S. manufacturing and service sectors and it came in at 40.5, down from 49.6 in February, the largest drop since 2008.

“We may very well be in a recession, but I would point to the difference between this and a normal recession,” U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said March 26 in an interview with NBC. “There is nothing fundamentally wrong with our economy,” he added.

On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said his department will work with Congress on creating financing programs, which he estimated could involve as much as $4 trillion. In addition, the government intends to provide another $2 trillion in stimulus to individual Americans, a measure passed unanimously in the Senate and set for vote in the House Friday.

“Pouring $6 trillion artificially creates somewhat of a ‘positive’ effect. But to me it’s like a bomb in slow motion. We will see dramatic consequences of these decisions,” said Constantin Kogan, a partner at cryptocurrency fund-of-funds BitBull Capital.

I am a little confused, to be honest,” said Jack Tan, founding partner of Taiwan-based crypto trading firm Kronos Research.","SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The NULS Technical Community (NTC), today released blueprints for Nerve Network, a decentralized digital asset service network, and a blockchain cross-chain interaction protocol based on the NULS microservice framework and developed with NULS ChainBox. Pseudo-anonymous developer and technical director for the NULS community, Berzeck, proposed the cross-chain solution. Berzeck's solution outlines a final critical piece to NULS' full-service ecosystem: a heterogeneous cross-chain interaction protocol that can bridge to and communicate with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other alternative blockchains.

At present, NULS is one of the most adaptive and customizable blockchain solutions in the world. It consistently places in the top 10 of the Center for Information and Industry Development’s (CCID) Global Public Blockchain Technology Assessment Index. The NULS project embodies a demand for modular blockchain solutions that suit both enterprise and retail needs. Now, with a heterogeneous cross-chain solution on the way, NULS is positioned to underpin the next generation of blockchain collaboration.

“We built NULS 2.0 with the ability to adapt and evolve a lot faster than any other blockchain,” said Berzeck. “Each module is an application itself so it can be replaced quickly, use any other developer languages, and even adopt other consensus mechanisms. Let me put it this way: If Vitalik finds the infinity scalability scheme, while he is receiving a Turing Award, we will pack it in a microservice and deploy via Chain Factory months and even years before Ethereum or another blockchain does.”

NULS has streamlined virtually all aspects of blockchain hosting, DAPP creation, and maintenance. The network operates with a democratized staking system that applies aspects of delegated proof-of-stake with a novel credit rating feature.

From concept to creation, NULS projects are community-driven.

Developers can:

Propose ideas to the network via the community forum Setup a master node and adjoining wallet Use Chain Factory or ChainBox to deploy underlying modules Have community members fund the project by staking their NULS to the ascribed master node via Proof of Credit Mining (POCM) Mint and distribute native tokens to community supporters Petition for listing on NULS native DEX Trade tokens earned through POCM to USDI - the NULS native stablecoin Code new modules in any development language

With its proposed Nerve Network, NULS aims to break the isolated value island of its blockchain, establish a cross-chain asset interaction network, and provide all the necessary underlying support for the decentralized application ecosystem.

“The NULS community has been hard at work,” said Reaper Ran, NULS founder. “Over the past year, NULS developers have made 4,324 GitHub commits, the fifth most of any blockchain project. Internationally, we see greater enthusiasm as we approach cross-chain functionality, and with our modular functionality, we are on pace to outperform all other incumbents. NULS will break the state that each blockchain is like a closed loop circuit, and it will foster a value interworking blockchain network. The future blockchain is not a single chain, but a block network composed of many chains.”

About NULS:

NULS is an open-source, enterprise-grade, adaptive blockchain platform that offers fast-track business solutions for developers. Featuring microservices, smart contracts, cross-chain interoperability, and instant chain-building, NULS sets a new industry standard in streamlining blockchain adoption.

Follow us on Twitter: @NULS","Right after the IAMAI vs RBI case judgement earlier this month, Indian crypto startups made a big splash with a host of announcements. But having been caught in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic that has impacted almost all industries, some of that early excitement may be on the wane.

While the Supreme Court’s latest judgement has given an immediate boost to these startups, the legal fight is far from over. The writ petitions of Siddharth Dalmia, Vijay Pal Dalmia and Rohan Dwaipayan Bhowmick demanding crypto regulations across the country are still pending and listed before the Supreme Court for hearing on April 27, 2020.

What’s been the impact of the Supreme Court’s judgement on the ground? Can cryptocurrency save the day for investors as markets crash?

The Supreme Court Judgement Triggers Exponential Growth

As we spoke to the leading crypto startups of the country, almost all the startup founders agreed that despite Covid-19 effect, as the judgement brought more legal understanding into the matter, there has been an exponential increase in its trade volume. However, due to the situation around lockdowns, some announcements by crypto startups have been postponed.

While the crypto market is equally affected by Covid-19 and the global meltdown, Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of WazirX, which was recently acquired by global exchange Binance told Inc42, “In the past 30 days, WazirX trading volume has grown by 473%.”

More importantly, there has been a change in the attitude of media and public towards Bitcoin, said Unocoin Technologies cofounder and CEO Sathvik Vishwanath.

“It was tough to explain to so many people about what the issue with the RBI is. Even the police and enforcers had the same view. So now the judgement has given clarity and also helped in spreading the word about this new technology. Some of the banks still have the anxiety to accept the crypto business for bank accounts but there are many which are supporting it. It seems RBI has not sent any kind of notice to banks since the judgement which probably will make the anxious banks as well jump on board.”

While Unocoin claims to be currently adding about 500 to 700 new users every day, CoinDCX witnessed 10X growth in the first week of the judgement and growth is continuing with marked uptrend, said Sumit Gupta, founder and CEO.

“Post the uplifting of the RBI ban, CoinDCX was the first exchange to integrate banking payment solutions in less than six hours. This shows that banks are open to collaborate with crypto companies provided the environment is right. We will witness many banks and payment companies opening to collaborating now in the near future,” Gupta said.

Another crypto exchange BuyUCoin too claimed a 400% increase in the trading volume on a daily basis since the judgement.

India’s Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Catalysed

Earlier this week, as CoinDCX announced the closure of its Series A funding, Delhi-based crypto exchange BuyUCoin partnered with fintech company Mobikwik for the seamless fiat-to-crypto conversion. BuyUCoin has also acquired a licence to operate from Estonia

Besides, Zebpay made a comeback to the India market under a different company name and new leadership, global exchanges such as Binance and OKEx have entered the Indian market as well. Recently, Binance announced the acquisition of Indian exchange WazirX, OKEx entered into a partnership with CoinDCX.

CoinDCX has launched its ambitious campaign, TryCrypto, which aims to onboard 50 Mn Indians into crypto.

“The $1.3 Mn investment will spearhead the TryCrypto initiative with funds allocated towards educational initiatives, seminars, and online courses (15%); roadshows and awareness campaigning (25%); meetups, community events, and community engagement (25%); and to product trials (35%).”

CoinDCX is also launching its own crypto learning program, DCXlearn.

London-based crypto startup Cashaa cofounder Kumar Gaurav and serial entrepreneur Gaurav Dubaey have announced plans to organise an Indian Crypto Bulls Roadshow 2020.

“Unocoin is launching the lending platform where our customers can collateralise Bitcoin and get USDT (a stable token backed by United States Dollars) or get INR to their bank account with up to 50% exposure. We are also looking at reviving the merchant gateway that used to have 2000 merchants in India which were accepting bitcoin as a mode of payment.”

WazirX, now a part of Binance, has already made some big announcements. Binance has been working on many fronts. Besides its exchange now operating through WazirX in India, it has also been running acceleration programmes with its focus on Asia-pacific under Binance Labs.

It also launched a $50 Mn ‘Blockchain in India’ fund to invest in Indian projects and startups focusing on solving problems through blockchain technology. “Besides investing, we also look forward to partnering with traditional funds who believe in blockchain, and provide mentorship and support to student organisations and universities who want to set up blockchain technology incubators. We plan to help every entrepreneur trying to solve a problem with blockchain technology,” said Shetty.

Can Crypto Help In Fighting Covid-19?

Barring China, South Korea and few other countries, Covid-19 pandemic has largely been unstoppable so far. India, with its limited resources, has now announced a lockdown across the country. And, the US, despite all its resources to its rescue, has badly failed in fighting the pandemic.

Can crypto be of any use in fighting Covid-19? Utsav Somani, partner of AngelList India and 0B1T Capital which has made investments in crypto and blockchain startups such as CoinDCX and Elemential Labs, pointed out the existing discrepancies with the fiat currencies and how US Federal Reserve and monitoring authority are printing record amount of money to deal with credit crisis amid Covid-19.

The Fed has even gone on to say that technically, they have unlimited amounts of cash to print. Such a behaviour of the central bank and authorities will put the entire economy out of whack. This is where crypto is useful. Being the internet of money, it’s borderless. As Covid-19 appears to be the black swan, it will even turn banks towards cryptocurrencies, claimed Somani.

“Crypto also ensures there’s no slippage in the funds received because the transfer charges are negligible compared to the 5 – 8% slippage seen when money is sent from one country to another.” – WazirX founder Nischal Shetty

Contactless is the new buzzword in the times of Covid-19. And, at this time of the pandemic, a lot of people may start looking at crypto, especially Bitcoin, as a store of value. “On the other side, because the crypto payments are contactless it can be of some use in many countries where the digital payment infrastructure does not exist,” said Vishwanath.

Seeing The Bigger Crypto Picture

In recent weeks, a fall in the price of Bitcoin and most of the leading cryptocurrencies have badly coincided with the global slow down. This has been worrisome for crypto stakeholders.

Somani told Inc42, “What’s really bothering is that cryptos showing a high degree of correlation to the major asset classes in the global economy right now. Both are going through a major crash, that is probably the bigger worry. With all eyes now on the public markets and oil price and the macro recession, which is going to be a testing time for cryptos to prove that it is de-correlated to the regular asset class or traditional asset classes.”

The Indian government has so far maintained that cryptocurrencies are neither currencies as they are not a legal tender, nor assets as they are not backed by any physical properties.

Sanat Rao, managing partner of US-based blockchain fund Shyn Capital believes that this binary understanding of cryptocurrencies must change. Speaking to Inc42, Rao commented, “Anytime, if you have a blanket ban on a piece of technology without understanding its nuances? It, unfortunately, prevents innovation.”

This is why we saw India falling behind in blockchain, Rao explained, “It’s important for us to distinguish that there is a speculative part of crypto which is like any other asset or a commodity and then there’s the underlying use case for that of those coins. Thus, there are speculators with trade. And then there are people who will actually use the crypto assets to execute smart contracts and so on. While the government has aptly looked into the first case scenario, it’s equally important to look at the next two-three scenarios as well, like the actual underlying use cases.”"
2020-03-27,"After staging a recovery earlier this week, cryptocurrencies were stuck in a holding pattern Friday afternoon.

Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) appeared to be in a period of consolidation where prices bounce around within a tight range, showing indecisiveness among traders.

Bitcoin and ether had both climbed by less than a percent. Notable performers on CoinDesk’s big board include XRP (XRP), up 10 percent, Stellar (XLM) in the green 3 percent and dash, up 4 percent. All 24-hour price changes are from 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET) on March 27.

Traditional markets, meanwhile, continued to reel from the record unemployment claims in the U.S., part of the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, despite a $2 trillion stimulus package making its way to President Donald Trump for his signature. U.S. stocks closed with the S&P 500 index down 3 percent. Earlier in the day, Japan’s Nikkei 255 closed its session up 3.8 percent. For Europe, the FTSE 100 Index closed in the red 3.3 percent.

Federal Reserve “and fiscal policies have averted for now accelerated economic and financial de-leveraging. Unfortunately, they can’t avoid a deep and sudden recession resulting in alarming unemployment and business closures,” Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, wrote in a tweet.

On low volumes, bitcoin’s price changes have narrowed, staying in a $6,400-$6,900 per 1 BTC range since March 24. This has put the bellwether cryptocurrency’s 10-day and 50-day moving averages close to each other.

“I think bitcoin just moved up from its $4,000-$5,000 crash range earlier than equities did. While equity markets have been rallying the last couple of sessions, other more safe haven-type markets like bonds and gold have been consolidating,” said Siddharth Jha, a former Wall Street analyst now focused on blockchain technology at startup Arbol.

Indeed, gold has started to consolidate moving averages as of March 27.

“Some people I respect say gold is a buy here,” said Rupert Douglas, head of business development for institutional sales at Koine, a digital asset manager. “Perhaps it is, perhaps silver is going to go rocketing higher, but if it doesn’t and trades lower, does bitcoin follow?”

The crash on March 12 is still fresh in the minds of crypto traders and fund managers, leaving some to think no trading decisions are the best decisions for the time being.

“Markets need to be saturated for people to look for incremental yield. Plus, there’s a lot of wound licking, post-BitMEX debacle,” said Vishal Shah, founder of Alpha5, a new derivatives exchange backed by large crypto funds.

Shah was referring to the $700 million of liquidations on BitMEX on March 12. This caused problems for the Ethereum network-based DeFi ecosystem, which relies on ether’s price to ensure stability. Not surprisingly, ether has been consolidating, although there was a bit of volume early Friday.

Binance has announced the launch of the Binance Card that allows users to shop and pay with crypto anywhere VISA is accepted.

Binance Card will initially be a virtual card in a Beta version of the new service.

Users can only top up using Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB).

The team at Binance has continually focused on building ever since the exchange was launched.

Crypto adoption just got the biggest boost this year as the popular crypto exchange of Binance has just announced the launch of a VISA powered crypto debit card. Aptly named Binance Card, it allows for users to top up the card using Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB). Users of the card will perform all the necessary top-ups through a yet to be released Binance Card App. The tweet making the announcement can be found below.

https://twitter.com/binance/status/1243495682444386304

Why the Binance Card is Bullish for BTC and BNB

The only assets that will be used to top up the card will be Bitcoin and Binance Coin. This, in turn, means BTC and BNB will have additional utility in the Binance Card app thus increasing demand for the two assets. Such demand will most likely affect the value of these digital assets in a positive way. The team at the exchange has explained their plans of rolling out the service on a global level thus increasing the exposure and demand of the two aforementioned assets. Bitcoin and Binance Coin will be the bridge for real use-case of cryptocurrencies for the day-to-day purchase of goods and services. CZ further explained this as follows.

Payments is an obvious use case for #crypto, yet adoption is slow. With only 0.1% of people having crypto, merchants have no incentive to accept it. And with few merchants accepting it, less users use it for payments. A chicken and egg problem. Now by using the #Binance Card, merchants continue to receive fiat, and the users pay in any #crypto they choose, Problem solved. Let there be #adoption.

How to Get the Virtual Binance Card

At the time of writing this, interested individuals are advised to register their interest in Binance Card through the landing page. The card will initially be a Virtual Card in a beta version. Once the virtual card is available in the various global jurisdictions, those who registered will be notified and advised to complete the process on the Binance Card app. Ordering the card will cost only $15 thus making the card cheaper than other available options such as Crypterium ($50) and Paycent ($49). However, in the latter two cases, the extra charges are for the physical delivery of the card.

Any additional opinion herein is purely the author’s and does not represent the opinion of Ethereum World News or any of its other writers. Please carry out your own research before investing in any of the numerous cryptocurrencies available. Thank you.","Anyone holding bitcoin would have watched the market with alarm in recent weeks. The virtual currency, whose price other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and litecoin largely follow, plummeted from more than US$10,000 (£8,206) in mid-February to briefly below US$4,000 on March 13. Despite recovering to the mid-US$6,000s at the time of writing, some doomsayers have even wondered whether bitcoin will soon spiral back into three figures.

To add to the gloom, these shifts have broadly mimicked those of stock markets as investors first panicked about coronavirus only to be somewhat reassured by the US government’s US$2 trillion fiscal stimulus package to reactivate the economy. This similar pattern has cast doubt on a common belief in the cryptocurrency industry that these assets would act as a “safe haven” during a downturn by moving in the opposite direction to the market as a whole. For many crypto-enthusiasts, this was one of the main attractions to buying these currencies.

Bitcoin vs S&P 500

Yet while this has been unfolding, a more encouraging trend has attracted much less attention. Having banned cryptocurrencies in the past, or refused to acknowledge them as money, various countries have suddenly started recognising them in their financial laws and courts. This could well mark an important shift for these digital assets towards the mainstream.

Starting guns

The motivation for these shifts has been new global standards for anti-money laundering and counter terrorism set by global watchdog the Financial Actions Task Force (FATF). The rules provide a useful know-your-customer/anti-money laundering framework for cryptocurrency transactions which did not exist previously and were the reason why many countries did not allow them.

On February 26, a French court ruled that a loan involving bitcoin was a consumer loan. This meant placing bitcoin in the same bracket as money and other financial assets in France for the first time, reassuring users that they will enjoy the same protections under the law.

Two days later, the financial services regulator in Abu Dhabi amended its virtual asset legislation to align with the FATF standards. Germany’s financial regulator, BaFin, followed suit on March 2, shortly followed by South Korea’s lawmakers. Having banned anonymous cryptocurrency transactions several years earlier, this is a complete change of direction from Seoul. Among other things, exchanges will have to open a real-name bank account with an authorised Korean bank, which should reassure many investors that they can be used safely.

India made a comparable U-turn on March 10 when its supreme court overturned the central bank’s 2018 ban on banks transacting with cryptocurrency firms. This move had led to a drastic fall in the use of cryptocurrencies in the country.

Finally, on March 16 Zimbabwe announced it is developing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies that will establish a clear procedure for firms to become compliant with the country’s financial regulations and therefore to be allowed to do business with banks. This, too, reversed a 2018 ban.

What now

Most of these moves have been made ahead of a June deadline to get in line with the FATF standards. A total of 37 countries are FATF members, including the UK and US, and more are expected to sign up to the same rules in the coming months.

So while many investors in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will have incurred huge losses in the past month, the status of this asset class within mainstream finance looks increasingly assured. The new rules clarify the status of cryptocurrency exchanges and other firms providing services in this space, making it much easier for them to transact with banks – and by extension, everyone else.

It almost certainly means that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will probably not be killed off by the COVID-19 crisis or indeed any other market event. With the growing market in crypto lending, these services look pivotally positioned to replace traditional banking services in the coming years. If more countries make similar moves to the ones I’ve highlighted above, crypto-assets could even become entrenched in the financial mainstream very soon.

The only caveat is that this is far from what the creators of the crypto movement foresaw when bitcoin was originally launched in 2009. Bitcoin was supposed to liberate the world from the financial system and the elites that control it. Now it is well on the way to being embraced by them instead.","Bitcoin Miners Are Selling Coins Faster Than They Can Generate Them

According to data sites and a number of observers, bitcoin miners are selling coins faster than they can produce them. Ever since the market downturn on March 12 and the week of falling prices that followed, bitcoin miners have been struggling.

Also read: Bitcoin Hashrate Down 45% – Miners Witness Second-Largest Difficulty Drop in History

Miners Sell More Bitcoin Than They Generate

On March 26, news.Bitcoin.com reported on how miners witnessed 45% of the overall hashrate shaved since Feb. 29 and miners also dealt with the second largest difficulty drop in history. Now according data from the analytical crypto website bytetree.com’s generation vs. first spend chart shows that bitcoin miners are selling a lot more than they are generating. There’s been a big shift since 3-6 months ago, when miners looked as though they were hoarding in preparation for the upcoming reward halving. Those hoards saved six months ago maybe keeping mining operations afloat, while they sell fresh coinbase rewards today.

Question: Who on Earth is crazy enough to be selling #bitcoin now? Answer: Miners. Relax, they're making money and spreading bitcoin to the world. Soon they'll have half as much to sell each day. 4 years later, they'll have half as much again — Arman The Parman (Bitcoin Moses) (@parman_the) March 25, 2020

Since then, however, statistics show that BTC prices jumped from $3,800 per coin to $6,700 on March 26. During more than 80% of that time period, miners sold way more coins than what they are producing at today’s issuance rate. Some bitcoiners think the shift is a “bullish” signal, while others think this belief is pure “hopium.”

Bytetree.com’s data reveals when the coins were first generated and the period of time that follows from when those same bitcoins are spent. Even though the price is one of the largest factors within the mining industry, most people don’t understand that there’s a great number of operations that used leveraged borrowing to mine bitcoins last year. Some mining operations that borrowed to fund their operations were probably liquidated and likely contributed to the 45% hashrate loss.

A Few Observers Believe Miner Sell-Off Is a Bullish Sign

Since ‘Black Thursday’ began and up until today, a large swathe of smaller mining operations shut down. This is because, during the last two years, financial services have appeared that allow mining operations to borrow capital and mining rigs in an attempt to profit later. Instead of helping miners curb risk and profit, lenders liquidated these miners who could not pay their loans after the big price dip. Charlie Morris, bytetree.com’s founder believes that the situation is bullish for bitcoin and tweeted about the current events on Wednesday. Morris tweeted:

Bitcoin miners today sold 2,788 against 1,588 mined. Slamming the market, yet the market takes it. That is bullish.

“47 days until selling pressure from miners cuts in half,” another individual tweeted observing the miners sell-off. “This is the primary source of sell pressure on the price of bitcoin — Time to drop some ballast and see how high we fly,” he added.

Further, not too long ago the crypto firm Tradeblock published a research report that estimates BTC prices need to be at least $12,500 by the time the network halves. Otherwise, miners will suffer a whole lot more than they are today, because revenues will be chopped in half instantly.

Microsoft wants to create a new cryptocurrency that’s still mined using PoW–except replacing expensive power-intense mining rigs with basic human energy. If that sounds a little strange, you should take a dive deep into the details of the patent published yesterday filed by Microsoft. It’s called: “Cryptocurrency system using body activity data.”



Microsoft’s Human-Mined Cryptocurrency – Creepy or Cool?

According to the patent, Microsoft’s cryptocurrency would make use of body activity data. This would allow individuals to mine crypto and replace the need for ASICs.

It sounds a little other-worldly and, honestly, borderline creepy. But if you can get past the idea of wiring humans up to some kind of server tracking their energy output, it could be a sustainable way of mining crypto without damaging the environment.

So, how does it work? As per the patent, Microsoft states that ‘human body activity’ needed to mine cryptocurrency could be very simple. We’re not talking about forcing tribes of gym-goers to run 20k here. In fact, it could be as little as:

a brain wave or body heat emitted from the user when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider, such as viewing an advertisement or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process.

Mining Crypto While Watching Ads

The document goes on to say that this type of activity would replace the “massive computation work” currently required by some conventional cryptocurrency systems. This is because the data that is gathered from the body activity could be regarded as Proof of Work:

therefore, a user can solve the computationally difficult problem unconsciously.

The patent states that certain tasks would reduce or increase computational energy accordingly, depending on how much activity they generate. The cryptocurrency system using human body activity data would most likely work through a server giving a command to a wearable device.

Body activity data may be generated based on the sensed body activity of the user. A cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify whether or not the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.

At this stage, Microsoft hasn’t yet stated whether this new cryptocurrency will be based on any blockchain in particular or whether the software giant will create its own framework. It’s also not certain whether this new cryptocurrency will actually go ahead. But, in case you were thinking about using human brain waves to replace hash power, sorry, Microsoft patented it first.

What do you make of Microsoft’s new foray into cryptocurrency? Add your thoughts below!

On March 18, the miner’s parent company, investment firm DPW Holdings, filed an update with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its business related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been heavily affecting companies and markets globally. Among other closures and down-scalings, its mining business is being shuttered.

“Digital Farms’ cryptocurrency mining operations have been suspended indefinitely, primarily due to the sharp decline in the market price for bitcoin,” the company wrote.

Last May, DPW announced Digital Farms, formerly Super Crypto Mining, had obtained a 617,000 square foot facility in the U.S. to set up operations with “immediate access to 28 megawatts of power and an infrastructure to support up to 300 megawatts.”

Super Crypto Mining was acquired by DPW in January 2018 and later re-branded as Digital Farms. According to DWP’s annual report filed with the SEC in April 2019, the mining operation had started off by borrowing $5 million from two institutional investors and buying a thousand of Bitmain’s Antminer S9 mining machines. Mining of bitcoin, litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH) under the new owner kicked off in February 2018.

The company’s first yearly revenue from crypto mining was $1.67 million, a small portion of DPW’s total $27 million revenue, according to the 2019 report. The company had been planning to mine the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and also offer cloud mining services.

Discussing its scenario under the coronavirus pandemic, DWP said in the latest filing: “Due to the unprecedented market conditions domestically and internationally, and the effect COVID-19 has had and will continue to have on the Company’s operations and financial performance, the extent of which is not currently known, the Company is temporarily suspending guidance for 2020.”","A Ponzi scheme as a type of investment fraud has been around for a while. It is based on fake promises to investors. Scammers claim that their investments will be profitable at little to no risk.

Like pyramid schemes, Ponzi schemes aim to attract many new clients to make investments. Then they have them involve their friends, family, and colleagues.

But how are Ponzi schemes connected to cryptocurrencies? And how to recognize Bitcoin Ponzi schemes?

How Does a Ponzi Scheme Work?

The scammers start generating income by attracting new members. They use the funds from new investors to pay out the old investors and keep the scheme up and running. The whole point is that scammers never invest the money. They use it to manipulate their investors into thinking they’re profiting. But, in fact, they are losing money at a rapid pace.

Ponzi schemes need a consistent flow of money to survive. When they can’t recruit more investors and have a lot of people cash out, they usually collapse.

Scammers have used this principle in many investment-related industries. Most recently, scammers have been trying to perform Ponzi schemes on digital currency investments.

What makes this type of scam convenient is the fact that the culprits are much more difficult to trace and have less regulatory oversight.

Is a Ponzi Scheme Responsible for the Latest Crypto Crash?

In the past couple of weeks, the massive crash in the cryptocurrency market has been taking over the headlines. The prices have fallen dramatically, which has resulted in a loss that’s worth around $50 billion. The Bitcoin price, which was around $10,000/BTC is down for about 30%, which is unheard of.

At first, many experts thought that this downfall happened because of the recent global market turmoil. Now, many believe that the cause might have been something else.

It seems that this huge surprise was the result of selling Bitcoin by PlusToken. PlusToken is a well-known Ponzi scheme prevalent in China and Korea. The initiators of this scheme managed to steal more than $2 billion worth of cryptocurrencies from investors.

On the 11th of March, PlusToken scammers moved over $100 billion. Experts think that culprits sold the cryptocurrency via different mixers. It caused a massive rise in supply, without enough demand to follow it. It produced this vast market fluctuation.

As you can see, a lot of investors got scammed. When it comes to Ponzi schemes, anyone can become a victim. Let’s talk about some red flags and how to avoid falling victim to this exploit.

How to Recognize Bitcoin Ponzi Schemes

Although they can be a bit tricky to spot, some things connect every Ponzi scheme. By learning all the signs, you can recognize and fight-off the potential issues. Here’s how to detect a scam:

1. Promises That Are Too Good to Be True

Investors know that every investment comes with a set of risks. “The higher the risk, the higher the reward” is a common phrase in the investment world. So, when someone approaches you with a proposal that offers little to no risk, something is wrong.

Ponzi schemers usually try to entice their victims by claiming that they have a profitable deal. According to them, it carries virtually no risks at all.

So, if it sounds too good to be true – it probably is.

2. Very Frequent Returns on Investment

Return on investment often fluctuates, depending on the market situation. They go up and down and aren’t consistent. Always be wary of any investment that has consistent returns, regardless of the market condition.

3. Unregulated Investments

Scammers usually prefer investments that have not been registered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or other regulatory bodies. It enables them to fly under the radar for as long as possible and keep the scheme going. Always stay clear of unregulated investments.

Other Precautions to Take

Nowadays, cryptocurrency theft and scamming are prevalent. After all, criminals have a lesser chance of getting caught.

If you haven’t already, you should consider implementing security measures. They can help to ensure that your cryptocurrency transactions are safe, private, and protected. Here’s what you can do:

An extensive list of companies posted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) includes well-known exchanges and custodians such as Binance, Coinbase, Ripple and BitGo, with all being allowed to continue operating without a payments license until July 28, 2020.

The exemption will end after that date, or if firms registered in Singapore submit a license application under the Payments Services Act 2019, or are approved or rejected for a license by MAS.

Under the act, all financial entities conducting payments are required to hold a license for specific payment services in Singapore, a rule aimed to ensure regulatory certainty and consumer safety. Parliament passed an amendment on 14 January 2019 bringing crypto, or Digital Payment Token services, under the same legislation.

The tougher anti-money laundering compliance regime facing firms as a result has already led to one firm shutting up shop. Cryptocurrency payments provider Coinpip said it was suspending operations on March 13 while it considered applying for the new license.

Crypto firms already working in Singapore are required to first register with MAS, then apply for a license to operate. A failure to notify MAS is a breach of the requirements and will mean such firms would lose any exemption, according to the new announcement.","Victor Argonov, senior analyst and crypto specialist at International Investment firm, EXANTE, believes, the cryptocurrencies could ultimately benefit from the current coronavirus crisis…

We have recently seen some of the sharpest market crashes in history. From February 20 to mid-March, the key American indices have dropped by around 30 per cent, while the cryptocurrency and oil markets have dropped by more than 50 per cent. The crisis was mainly caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but the split among the OPEC+ countries that could not reach a consensus about decreasing the oil production rates was also another destabilising factor.

However, in spite of this, we see some opportunities. If the scale of the pandemic does not become absolutely catastrophic, the stock market can bring significant profits to the investors by mid-2020. In addition, a serious growth can be expected on the cryptocurrency market as well. As for the traditional safe haven assets such as gold, they seem like a less lucrative investment today, although they can help one diversify one's portfolio.

Until mid-March, the cryptocurrencies were declining along with the stocks, and the correlation between the BTC exchange rates and the S&P 500 index set a new all-time record. From February 20 to March 15, S&P 500 decreased by around 30 per cent, while BTC's price nearly halved, from about USD10000 to USD5000. However, after the announcement of the emergency measures by the Federal Reserve on 16-17 March the markets no longer correlated with each other. The correlation between S&P and BTC decreased sharply, and the cryptocurrency exchange rates began to grow despite further decrease of the indices. By March 19 BTC already cost over USD6000. Most likely, this was due to the investors' fears of the US dollar devaluing after the Federal Reserve's drastic measures.

It is still hard to say if the crypto market's recovery is going to last, but a stable positive trend is very likely to be established by April. Even if the dollar does not devalue, the BTC halving in May remains a solid argument against a crypto crash. Currently, one can make a profit mining cryptocurrencies even in countries with cheap electricity at a price of at least USD4000. In May, the block reward and the emission will halve, and the bar for profitable mining will rise to USD6000-7000. Below this price, there is going to be a serious deficit of sellers on the market. This would most likely mean that the market price of BTC is going to be no less than USD8000.

Out of all the possible assets, we have examined three – cryptocurrencies, stocks, and gold. At the moment, both cryptocurrencies and stocks can bring an investor a decent profit by November. The coronavirus is putting a serious pressure on the stock market and has accelerated the cryptocurrency crash, but all the remaining factors point to the growth of these markets in the next few months.

For the cryptocurrencies, these are the BTC halving and the continuing increase in the number of market participants, as well as the possible devaluation of national currencies due to the leading countries printing more money.

For the stocks, it is the zero interest rate from the Federal Reserve, and the US administration would greatly benefit from new records for the stock indices. However, an optimistic prognosis for the stock market is only possible for the moderate scenario of the pandemic, so one needs to have safe haven assets in one's portfolio, such as cryptocurrencies or gold."
2020-03-28,"New on-chain data suggests Bitcoin (BTC) investors are paying close attention to their funds amid the recent crypto crash and rising global economic turmoil.

According to the crypto analytics firm Glassnode, cryptocurrency traders are withdrawing their BTC from exchanges at a rapid rate and moving it to private wallets, bringing the amount of BTC on exchanges to their lowest levels in approximately eight months.

“Despite the volatility, Bitcoin holders appear to be withdrawing their funds from exchanges.

Outflow has been increasing daily since March 18. According to our labels, BTC exchange balances are the lowest they’ve been in ~8 months.”

There are a number of potential explanations for the mass exodus of BTC from exchanges. Traders may be:

Choosing to maintain custody of their own assets without middlemen Deciding to hold on for the long term and cease trading Concerned about the liquidity of crypto exchanges amid the market downturn

The move coincides with a surge in the creation of new Bitcoin addresses.

The research team at Glassnode says the three-day moving average of new addresses jumped 11.7% in a 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday.

Crypto analyst and technical trader Scott Melker says he’s now watching legendary investor and crypto critic Warren Buffett to gauge when global markets have hit a bottom.

“In my conversation with [Morgan Creek Capital Management founder] Mark Yusko, we discussed when the market bottom would likely be in.

We both agreed that the most reliable signal will be when Warren Buffet deploys his 125b (roughly) dollars. Hasn’t happened yet.”

At time of publishing, Bitcoin bulls are now fighting to hold the psychological level of $6,000.

BTC is down 7.40% in the last 24 hours at $6,264, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum is down 6.48% at $129.89 and XRP is down 1.95% at $0.1708.","In brief Charities are opening their doors to cryptocurrency donations and crypto projects.

Leaders from the field see 2020 as a turning point in charitable crypto adoption.

Charities will increasingly hold crypto donations without immediately converting them to fiat currency.

Cryptocurrencies and charities seem like a match made in heaven. Transparency, immutability, and traceability: everything charities need to work effectively.

Correspondingly, charities are opening their doors to both crypto donations and crypto projects. Binance has raised millions (albeit, mostly from money it’s donated to itself) for charity projects, and United Nations organizations such as UNICEF have incorporated blockchain technology into many of their work and fundraising campaigns. Countless others have followed suit.

So how will crypto change the face of charity? We asked leaders who straddle the divide between crypto and charity to share their thoughts. Here’s what they said.

Crypto donations will rise

Alex Wilson, of The Giving Block, a platform that helps charities accept crypto donations, is, perhaps unsurprisingly, optimistic. “We think 2020 is really going to be a turning point for nonprofit adoption of cryptocurrencies. We already saw the amount of nonprofits accepting crypto double last year,” he told Decrypt. Still, “double”, in this context, means an increase from, er, 1% to 2%.

""2020 is really going to be a turning point for nonprofit adoption of cryptocurrencies."" Alex Wilson

However, Wilson said that in the past few years, crypto donations have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars—and when the market’s performing well, charities receive more crypto donations. At the height of the Bitcoin bubble in December 2017, an anonymous do-gooder, “Pine,” set up the Pineapple Fund, which gave away up to $86 million in Bitcoin to various charities over its lifetime.

Wilson said 2019 saw nothing like that, but there were “still a lot of multi-million dollar donations,” like a $4.2 million donation to Carnegie Mellon. “I think as soon as the market picks up, you're going to start seeing more things like the Pineapple Fund popping back up,” he said.

Donate crypto, tweet and RECRUIT friends! https://t.co/96AbuAKRlF Here’s who’s with us so far: pic.twitter.com/LKcN6mrlTe — The Giving Block (@TheGivingBlock) March 23, 2020

But the state of the crypto market aside, Wilson said that in 2020 and beyond, crypto donations will rise because those holding crypto, generally millennials and their juniors, have begun to enter the workforce en masse. Charities “want to start building these lifelong relationships with the younger donors who are in their twenties and thirties,” said Wilson. “When they hear stats like ’20% of millennials own cryptocurrency’, that's really exciting for them because they really struggle to connect with younger donors.”

“That's why I've spent five years working on this,” said Suzanne Pelletier, executive director of the Rainforest Foundation US, a New York City-based charity. “I'm really convinced that the market will just get bigger and bigger and, by default, the size of philanthropy in that group will increase,” she said. More and more use cases are being created, and that’ll create value in the network, Pelletier says, though she acknowledges she’s by no means an authority on the matter. Still, the Rainforest Foundation US isn’t making big bucks from Bitcoin just yet: from a budget of over $3 million, just $17,000 was raised from Giving Tuesday in 2019.

Ettore Rossetti, head of global digital at Save the Children, wonders who the next Pine will be—and hopes that, by continuing to support cryptocurrencies, he’ll persuade the next anonymous philanthropist to send some Bitcoin his way the next time the market surges. The charity first started supporting crypto in 2013 in response to Typhoon Haiyan. Since then, “we haven’t raised millions of dollars” through cryptocurrencies,” he said, but “tens of thousands of dollars.”

He thinks part of the reason for a lacklustre amount of donations is that, though more people are getting into donations, speculators are likely to HODL—their reasoning being that a $100 donation to starving children now could become a $100,000 donation when Bitcoin’s price goes to the moon. If it does.

Charities keep more crypto donations in crypto

“I think we'll start seeing some of the nonprofits getting more comfortable with actually holding on to the donations and not necessarily always converting them,” said The Giving Block’s Wilson.

For now, the Rainforest Foundation US converts donations in crypto right away. “Our board just decided we’d treat them under the same policy that we have with stocks,” converting them immediately to “decrease our risk,” said Pelletier. However, the charity’s far from stuck in the past: In 2015, The Rainforest Foundation, in fact, created its own token, BitSeeds, which ran for a while on Bittrex before being delisted. Save the Children also converts crypto donations to fiat straight away, said Rossetti.

But Christina Lomazzo, who heads blockchain for the United Nations’ children’s charity, UNICEF, has taken the plunge. In October, UNICEF started accepting cryptocurrencies without immediately converting them to fiat, the first time a UN agency has done so. There were three reasons for doing so. The first, for transparency; the second, to move assets around at speed; the third, to experiment, said Lomazzo.

We are now able to receive, hold and disburse donations in cryptocurrencies - ether and bitcoin. Learn more about our new UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund! 👇 — UNICEF (@UNICEF) October 9, 2019

UNICEF’s just dangling its toes in crypto’s drainpipe for now: to date, it's made three investments, totalling one Bitcoin and a hundred Ether (worth around $30,000 at the time), disbursed into three blockchain companies who’d already received prior investment from UNICEF. Soon, UNICEF will open a call for another round of funding, and companies will be able to receive up to $100,000 in Ethereum or Bitcoin.

Charities will work with blockchain and crypto more

If donations don’t pan out, the Rainforest Foundation, like a growing number of other charities, is working on integrating blockchain into one of its projects. It's using blockchain to integrate satellite data for deforestation in the Peruvian rainforest. Then, after training leaders of indigenous communities to analyze that data, the Foundation will have members of their communities collect evidence of deforestation.

Recording tasks such as these on a blockchain, said Pelletier, makes it easy to reward community members on the blockchain; otherwise, remunerating members of communities is “just too onerous a process.” But, “within the next year or two, the communities themselves will have the wallets and the transactions will go directly to that,” she said.

“Crypto provides a transparent payment trail showing how the money was used.” Raphaël Mazet

Raphaël Mazet, of Alice, a blockchain company that’s geared around social impact, told Decrypt that blockchain and crypto has a bright future in the charity sector. “Public trust in nonprofits has been declining for years, and it's starting to affect donation levels, especially amongst smaller donors. Crypto provides a transparent payment trail showing how the money was used,” he said.

1. We're restoring trust in charities & social funders by encouraging a culture of transparency with impact data 🔍 This means that you or I can see exactly what our donation achieves, and truly effective charity projects end up getting the most funding. 📊💰💫 — alice (@alice_si_) January 18, 2019

He spoke not of the “accountability to donors,” which “can be dangerous if it leads to charities slashing overhead costs to unsustainable levels or catering to donor vanity metrics,” but of the “the operational efficiencies they can gain from blockchain technology: automated reporting, giving agency to their beneficiaries, and scalability.”

However, with charities bracing themselves for a hit to fundraising activities as coronavirus lockdown measures take effect, they may have other things on their mind than crypto adoption.","Major South Korean Bank Prepares to Launch Crypto Services as Government Green-Lights Regulation

Following the approval of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies by the South Korean government, one of the largest banks in the country is preparing to launch a range of crypto services. KB Kookmin Bank has applied for trademark registration, reportedly listing over 20 crypto services on its application.

KB Kookmin Bank Registers Trademark for a Wide Range of Crypto Services

One of the largest banks in South Korea, KB Kookmin Bank has filed a registration application to trademark “KBDAC.” Local news outlet Digital Today reported on Friday that the bank listed over 20 crypto services on its application, adding that trademark registration can take between six months and two years in South Korea.

The bank’s filing with the Korean Intellectual Property Office dated Jan. 31 details a number of crypto services, including trading, financial reporting, asset management, consulting, advisory, over-the-counter brokerage, and custody.

A KB Kookmin Bank official explained that KBDAC is related to the bank’s collaboration with blockchain company Atomrigs Lab Inc., announced in June last year, the publication conveyed. However, the official did not reveal the service launch date. Meanwhile, the bank has also been actively exploring various use cases of blockchain technology.

South Korea Approves Crypto Regulation

KB Kookmin Bank’s move coincides with the passing of a revision to the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information. This bill, introduced in November last year, passed the National Assembly on March 5 and the South Korean government approved its revision on March 17.

Under the new law, South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges must use the real-name system by partnering with a financial institution that can provide this service. Banks will be obligated to conduct customer due diligence on the crypto businesses they deal with, ensuring proper reporting to the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KOFIU).

“The revision bill will take effect one year after promulgation, and the current crypto-asset business operators will be given a six-month transition period to report to the KOFIU,” South Korea’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency, explained. “This revision act will place Korea’s legal framework on crypto assets more in line with international standards set forth by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and strengthen its AML/CFT regime.”

Do you think many South Korean banks will start offering crypto services? Let us know in the comments section below.

Key Takeaways Binance will delist FTX Exchange's leveraged tokens by Mar. 31, 2020.

Binance's CEO cited user confusion when trading such products.

The CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, faulted Binance with failing to educate users on the nature of leveraged tokens.

Share this article

Crypto exchange Binance has announced that they will be delisting FTX Exchange’s leveraged tokens. The announcement said that the exchange would delist the tokens due to users’ “lack of understanding of how leveraged tokens work.”

Binance Delists FTX Exchange Product

Binance announced that they would no longer platform FTX Exchange’s leveraged tokens. Users have until Mar. 31 to move funds off of Binance.

For tokens that are not moved before this time, Binance reported that it would credit users’ accounts “with the equivalent value held in each leveraged token at the time of delisting in BUSD.”

The assets to be delisted include BULL, BEAR, ETHBULL, ETHBEAR, EOSBULL, EOSBEAR, BNBBULL, BNBBEAR, XRPBULL, and XRPBEAR reads the announcement.

The BULL and BEAR tokens represent 3x long and short levered positions on Bitcoin, respectively. For every percentage point that BTC goes up, BULL will increase by 3%. The same is true for drops.

Since the announcement, users have been mass selling their leveraged tokens on Binance.

Others have already complained, citing multi-thousand dollar losses due to the delisting. The CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, has responded to each critique with what appears to be the same message, copied and pasted.

They are not designed for long term holding. They devalue over time when markets (underlying assets) fluctuate back and forth. The main reason for delisting is that too many users don't understand them. — CZ Binance ??? (@cz_binance) March 28, 2020

The CEO cites the lack of user understanding when it comes to such volatile products.

During the latest market crash, many holders of leveraged tokens suffered severe losses. A portion of these losses should also be equated to order book lags on Binance.

In response to the delisting, Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX Exchange, said that Binance was at fault for failing to educate users.

In an update shared with Crypto Briefing, an FTX announcement reads:

“Binance is going to delist Leveraged Tokens next week; you can see their announcement here. Leveraged Tokens are complicated products, and Binance doesn’t want to manage the user education and customer support for them.”

The announcement also says that users who want to continue using FTX’s leveraged tokens should do so by opening an FTX account.

This isn't the first time I've written about mining cryptocurrency with your body, either.

VIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES

The company published a patent yesterday called ""Cryptocurrency system using body activity data"", which while it sounds strange, it sees Microsoft using ""human body activity"" to mine cryptocurrency. Microsoft explains it as ""a brain wave or body heat emitted from the user when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider, such as viewing an advertisement or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process"".

This could lead to a world where you could be paid for watching ads online or on TV, in cryptocurrency. Microsoft's interest new patent would see the crypto mining activity replacing the ""massive computation work"" that is required by normal cryptocurrency systems. The data that is taken from the body activity, would be regarded as Proof of Work ""therefore, a user can solve the computationally difficult problem unconsciously"". Oh, that doesn't sound creepy at all.

How Does This Work?

Microsoft's parent suggests that a server would sent a task to users' devices, with special sensors that would bind the user to a server and other cryptocurrency mining humans. The server would blast a task request to users' devices, and then check through them to see if their body activity meets the conditions/rules set by the system.

If they pass the conditions, then they will receive cryptocurrency as a reward.

If the economy is destroyed from the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, maybe there is a future that Microsoft sees where we all sit down on the couch or on our phones and generate income from watching ads. It's not like that is the basis for countless dystopian novels, TV shows or movies or anything... right?!","The Malta Financial Services Authority, or MFSA, has issued an alert on March 25 about two crypto exchanges that do not have licenses to operate, nor are they regulated in the country.

COINMALEX and Crypto Foxtrades are the exchanges that the country’s financial watchdog alluded to in the statement, as both companies claimed on their websites that they had the necessary regulations and licenses to operate.

Crypto Foxtrades claimed that they had the “Category 3 Investment Services” provider from the Maltese authorities to operate.

The MFSA clarified the following about Crypto Foxtrades in the public warning:

“The MFSA wishes to alert the public, in Malta and abroad, that Crypto Foxtrades is NOT a Maltese registered Company NOR licenced or otherwise authorised by the MFSA to provide the service of an exchange or other financial services which are required to be licenced or otherwise authorised under Maltese law.”

Scheme of “dubious nature”

As for COINMALEX, the financial watchdog adds that the information they have about this crypto exchange suggests that it is a scheme of “dubious nature” and that it could carry a high risk of losing money.

On their official website, COINMALEX claims to offer trust assets management of the highest quality through cryptocurrency trading.

The MFSA advises the following:

“The public should therefore refrain from undertaking any business or transactions with the above-mentioned entity.”

Recent warnings issued by the MFSA

The public warning comes after Malta’s financial watchdog said on February 21 that the major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has never been licensed to operate in the country.

The following day, Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao commented on the MFSA’s statement via Twitter, which he described as “old news” and stated that Binance “has a number of regulated entities around the world, either operated by our partners or by Binance.com directly.”

However, speaking to Cointelegraph, Malta’s Junior Minister for Financial Services and Digital Economy, BartoloClayton, clarified the position that the watchdog has regarding crypto in the country despite the public warning on Binance:","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Complex transactions on Ethereum are defined as those which must interact with a smart contract.

These transactions make up most of DeFi, and reports indicate they are growing.

Without a scalability solution, these operations could bog down Ethereum even further.

Share this article

Slowly but steadily, “complex” smart contract transactions are overtaking standard Ethereum transactions. As these transactions need more gas to execute, the network risks becoming much more expensive as it makes room for DeFi operations.

DeFi Slowly Competing with Value Transfer

According to Ganesh Swami, CEO of Covalent, Ethereum transactions can be classified into three broad categories: ETH, ERC-20, and so-called “complex” transactions. The first two are standard transactions where a user sends Ether or an ERC-20 token.

The third category involves transactions that require users to interact with a smart contract.

Sending ETH from one address to another is a standard ETH transfer, but investing in a yield aggregator like iEarn Finance or taking out a flash loan are defined as complex transactions.

After analyzing Ethereum gas costs for each type of transaction, Swami concluded that complex transactions on Ethereum are slowly overtaking the number of standard ETH transfers.

There appears to be a limit to the amount of gas all three types of transactions consume together, which leads to competition for block space on Ethereum, per Swami.

This competition may put DeFi applications at risk due to their inherent complexity. Swami told Crypto Briefing that:

“Scalability enables all kinds of transactions to grow at their own pace without having to compete/cannibalize each other. There will always be competition for block space. The analogy I like to think about as the CPU markets. Each generation of CPUs introduces more features, more speed, less power consumption, and higher density.”

Last year, DeFi was the catalyst for a spike in complex transactions on Ethereum. The continuation of this trend could come from a mixture of DeFi, DAOs, and maybe even security tokens if favorable regulation was to surface.

The rise in complex transactions is evidence that Ethereum is slowly becoming a hub for innovative applications despite its perceived fragility.

With scalability advancements such as zk-rollups, there could be a lot more room for both regular and complex transactions on Ethereum.","Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies too have lately witnessed a slowdown in sync with other conventional stocks and assets. While the Covid-19 pandemic has probably overruled the Bitcoin halving effect which is due in May, this year, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao aka CZ does not seem to be agreeing with this.

In an interaction with BlockTV, CZ said, “I personally believe that the halving was not priced in” adding that he does not usually make forecasts.

In a tweet, CZ, meanwhile, also said that Bitcoin market cap has the potential to hit $2 Tn, as most of the Bitcoins are not for sell. He tweeted,

As we get used to talk about Trillions, a modest $2 trillion market cap of #bitcoin will put 1 BTC at $100,000. Not such a hard to imagine number now, right? As most BTC are not for sell (HODLers), we only need a small portion of that $2t to buy to reach it.

CoinDCX, Unocoin Announce New Plans

India’s leading crypto platforms CoinDCX and Unocoin have announced new plans. Speaking to Inc42, Sumit Gupta, founder and CEO of CoinDCX informed that CoinDCX has launched its ambitious campaign, TryCrypto, which aims to onboard 50 Mn Indians into crypto.

“The $1.3 Mn investment will spearhead the TryCrypto initiative with funds allocated towards educational initiatives, seminars, and online courses (15%); roadshows and awareness campaigning (25%); meetups, community events, and community engagement (25%); and to product trials (35%).”

CoinDCX is also launching its own crypto learning program, DCXlearn.

Meanwhile, Unocoin is now planning to launch a lending platform for its customers. Cofounder and CEO Sathvik Vishwanath told Inc42, “Unocoin is launching the lending platform where our customers can collateralise Bitcoin and get USDT (a stable token backed by United States Dollars) or get INR to their bank account with up to 50% exposure. We are also looking at reviving the merchant gateway that used to have 2000 merchants in India which were accepting bitcoin as a mode of payment.”

Ban Bitcoin: Entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa

Commenting on the regulatory confusion over cryptocurrencies in India, Vivek Wadhwa, entrepreneur and distinguished fellow, Harvard Law School, Labor and Worklife Program told Inc42,

If I could advise the government on this, I would call for a ban Bitcoin and its kin. India does not need these, there is already too much corruption in the country.

However, accepting the fact that digital currency is the future and need-of-the-hour, Wadhwa added that India’s Unified payments Interface (UPI) technologies are the most advanced in the world. Several companies have successfully built legal and proper payments systems on top of these. He said the government must invest more in UPI payments and other digital payments and encourage people to move to this, rather than crypto.

Italian Bank Banca Sella Offers Bitcoin Trading

In a rare move, one of the leading Italian private banks Banca Sella has now launched a Bitcoin trading service which is currently available on its Hype platform in beta mode.

Over 1.2 Mn users are currently using Hype and hence will be able to conduct Bitcoin transactions. The move has been taken in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic which has seen the highest number of deaths in Italy so far and has badly impacted the country’s economy.

CME Group May Focus On Bitcoin Mining

US-based Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group has been among the very firsts to launch Bitcoin futures contracts and is currently said to be the largest institutional provider of Bitcoin futures contracts.

However now, Dante Federighi, a nominee for CME Group’s upcoming board of directors election and cofounder of the investment managing firm Fortezza Forza RMC Fund has apparently said that CME Group should create more value for its investors and should divert the excess energy to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Federighi has suggested that the company would immediately convert any newly minted cryptocurrencies into fiat which will generate additional revenue for its shareholders.","Existing outside of the realm of traditional finance and with no central point of authority, digital assets have posed several challenges to governments worldwide. Many nations have struggled with how to define and regulate cryptocurrencies, and there is no uniformity because each country has developed its own unique approach.

Data and transparency seem to be some of the best tools on the road to regulatory certainty and institutional demand. While some countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are taking advantage of this to build a better tax and regulatory framework, others don’t deal with crypto quite as well. India, for example, just recently decided to lift its crypto ban and engage with the sector.

Cryptocurrencies are legal in most countries, with Japan being a shining example of progressive legislation. In 2017, the Japanese government became the first country to recognize Bitcoin (BTC) as a currency and to grant official licenses to exchanges, fostering the growth of what was already one of the biggest Bitcoin markets worldwide.

There are more examples of countries with crypto-friendly regulations and tax policies, but not all pro-crypto countries have developed legal frameworks quite as favorable as Portugal has, especially when it comes to taxing retail traders.

Most countries charge the normal capital gains tax for cryptocurrency profits, such as the U.S. or the U.K., and in many cases filing those taxes can be a nightmare. Florian Wimmer, the CEO and co-founder of Blockpit — a company that offers tax calculation and portfolio tracking for cryptocurrencies — told Cointelegraph:

“In most countries crypto is seen as economic goods, like e.g. property and is taxed after existing regulation for such assets. This means that every single transaction is a taxable event. [...] Then there are regulatory differences between certain coins/tokens (especially with securities now) and other ‘special tax events’ like handling hard forks, airdrops, etc. Then you should of course keep track of your assets, and their acquisition time and value, while you move them between your exchange accounts and wallets. I guess you can see where the complexity comes from.”

This is where countries like Portugal have very crypto-friendly laws. Although it’s safe to say that digital assets are still largely misunderstood by regulatory entities and the public, one can speculate that some of these entities in Portugal and other countries are willing to provide a friendly foundation for digital assets to grow.

Taxes in Portugal before 2017

Although crypto taxes in Portugal may now be seen as friendly, allowing retail traders to benefit from a zero-VAT policy wasn’t always the case. In the past, the outlook on Bitcoin and its taxation and regulation was either uncertain or negative. Back in 2013, Banco de Portugal — the country’s central bank — issued a statement warning users of the risks of crypto trading, given the lack of a central authority and “protection fund for depositors/investors.” The statement read:

“Since there is no central entity that guarantees the irrevocability and definitiveness of payments, Bitcoin cannot be considered a safe currency, given that there is no certainty in its acceptance as a payment method.”

At the end of 2016, the Portuguese Tax and Customs Authority released an official document stating that the trading and selling of cryptocurrencies would be subject to value-added tax, declaring:

“Cryptocurrencies are not technically considered ‘currency.’ [...] However, they can be exchanged with gains, for real currencies (be it euros, dollars, or another), with companies specialized for that effect. […] As so, cryptocurrencies can generate different types of taxable returns.”

In the document, regulators mentioned that winnings obtained through the buying or selling of cryptocurrencies were indeed taxable. At the time, the Ministry of Finance also stated that Bitcoin had no legal framework, but that its earnings were still taxable in the same manner as other tradable assets. However, regulatory entities continued to greatly contradict each other during this time.

In 2017, the uncertainty peaked and getting answers regarding the taxation of crypto was not easy. As mentioned in the Portuguese financial publication Jornal de Negócios, the Tax and Customs Authority stated that yes, all trading in Bitcoin is subject to VAT. However, when asked over the phone, the Ministry of Finance stated that the digital currency was not subject to any taxes at all.

This confusion stems from the fact that the Tax and Customs Authority wanted to tax Bitcoin-related gains despite the lack of any sort of fiscal legislation, which seemed to have created a sort-of-confusing loophole in reporting taxes on cryptocurrencies.

Portugal and Bitcoin: A bumpy road to friendly taxes

Now, things are looking much clearer for traders and all those dealing with Bitcoin in Portugal. In December 2017, the Ministry of Finance told Dinheiro Vivo, a Portuguese financial news outlet, that retail trades of Bitcoin would not be taxable and that only income or trades resulting from professional activities would be taxed. A ministry official stated:

“The sale of Bitcoins is not taxable under IRS in relation to the Portuguese tax system, namely within the scope of the category E (capitals) or G (gains), except when, due to its habituality, it constitutes a professional or business activity of the taxpayer, in which case it will be taxed in accordance with category B.”

To put it simply, a casual retail trader doesn't need to pay taxes for these trades. However, if you’re a company trading Bitcoin as a service or for yourself, or if you are an individual who earns your income from trading activities, you need to pay taxes. When it comes to salaries being paid in Bitcoin or crypto, these are fully taxed the same as they would be with any other currency. But not all countries make it as easy to receive salaries in crypto, as Igor Samohin, a product manager at PaymentX, told Cointelegraph:

“When you trade securities or any other financial instruments, you pay taxes. I can assume they do it to popularize crypto, and taxes will come later. That’s good of course. [...] Countries that don’t allow pay salaries in Crypto, are afraid that it's not regulated currencies, and they don’t understand that transactions in Bitcoin, for example, are more transparent than fiat payments with bank cards.”

To further cement certainty, the Tax and Customs Authority issued clear guidelines in January 2019 in response to a query regarding Article 68 of its general tax law. Those guidelines provided many answers to common questions related to dealing with Bitcoin. The document sought to answer important questions, such as which documents to fill out in which cases, how to issue cryptocurrency invoices, rules for initial coin offerings, and much more. Jorge Mesquita, the chief operating officer of Universe Coin — a Portugal-based company providing wallet payment terminals — expanded on the matter:

“Currently the Portuguese Securities Market Commission (CMVM) evaluates each ICO individually, and they consider that ‘a commitment from the issuer to adopt actions that result in an expectation of financial return to the investors must be present in the qualification of transferable securities,’ which we abide by, and there are no laws or regulations specifically addressing token sales, so we haven’t run into any problems.”

But this was not the last time the country would enact favorable legislation in regard to cryptocurrencies. Last year, the Tax and Customs Authority released yet another document that cites a previous 2015 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union, declaring that cryptocurrency payments and mining rewards will not be subject to VAT.

Portugal: A new crypto scene?

Not taxing Bitcoin can look counterintuitive, as it doesn’t really seem to benefit governments in the short term. But driving the growth of cryptocurrency businesses could be a strong incentive. Many already regard Lisbon as somewhat of a startup and tech hub, with important events like the Web Summit being hosted there.

This outlook on cryptocurrencies may be a move to get users interested in trading and to generate more Portugal-based trading venues and other enterprises. Taxing these entities may prove to be more fruitful in the future, and according to Mesquita:

“Portugal is a small country in the European Union, considered to be a good testing ground for tech companies, especially startups. [...] Even at a European level, cryptocurrencies aren’t treated as the disruptive innovation they can be and so, Portuguese authorities have stated that cryptocurrency payments are free of VAT, and crypto mining and trading earnings are not subject to income tax, making Portugal an ideal country for crypto users.”

The future of crypto in Portugal

Despite progressive legislation when it comes to taxes, Portugal has yet to establish a specific regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The activity of issuing and trading digital currencies is still unregulated and unsupervised by the country’s central bank or any other national or European financial authority.

The central bank also encourages all credit, payment and electronic currency institutions to refrain from buying, holding or selling cryptocurrencies due to the numerous risks involved.

Nevertheless, the progressive attitude of the Portuguese government toward retail cryptocurrency trading and miners is making it very attractive for traders and investors. When asked about how the government benefits from these crypto tax breaks, Wimmer said:

“Obviously, they benefit from not having to deal with this complexity themselves too when demanding taxes and controlling people and of course getting people and businesses to relocate to their country and then profit from that in other ways.”

All of the above factors create fertile soil for cryptocurrency infrastructure to blossom, possibly rivaling other pro-crypto countries like Malta. However, the implementation of an appropriate legal framework may still be years away and will depend on how the industry and technology progress in the country.

Guido Santos, the founder and chief technology officer of Genesis Studio — a Portugal-based provider of blockchain-focused consulting, development and integration services — told Cointelegraph: “We're in a country where regulation only moves forward when the technology does.”"
2020-03-29,"Microsoft Patents New Cryptocurrency System Using Body Activity Data

Microsoft has patented a cryptocurrency mining system that leverages human activities, including brain waves and body heat, when performing online tasks such as using search engines, chatbots, and reading ads. “A user can solve the computationally difficult problem unconsciously,” the patent reads.

Crypto System Leveraging Body Activity Data

Microsoft Technology Licensing, the licensing arm of Microsoft Corp., has been granted an international patent for a “cryptocurrency system using body activity data.” The patent was published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on March 26. The application was filed on June 20 last year. “Human body activity associated with a task provided to a user may be used in a mining process of a cryptocurrency system,” the patent reads, adding as an example:

A brain wave or body heat emitted from the user when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider, such as viewing advertisement or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process.

Noting that the method described may “reduce computational energy for the mining process as well as make the mining process faster,” the patent details:

For example, instead of massive computation work required by some conventional cryptocurrency systems, data generated based on the body activity of the user can be a proof-of-work, and therefore, a user can solve the computationally difficult problem unconsciously.

Patent Suggests Alternative Way to Mine Cryptocurrencies

The patent describes a system where a device can verify whether “the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.”

Different types of sensors can be used to “measure or sense body activity or scan human body,” the patent explains. They include “functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanners or sensors, electroencephalography (EEG) sensors, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors, heart rate monitors, thermal sensors, optical sensors, radio frequency (RF) sensors, ultrasonic sensors, cameras, or any other sensor or scanner” that will do the same job.

The system may reward cryptocurrency to an owner or a task operator “for providing services, such as, search engines, chatbots, applications or websites, offering users access for free to paid contents (e.g. video and audio streaming or electric books), or sharing information or data with users,” the patent details.

The idea of mining cryptocurrencies using human body heat has previously been explored by other organizations. For example, Manuel Beltrán, founder of the Dutch Institute of Human Obsolescence, set up an experiment in 2018 to mine cryptocurrencies with a special bodysuit that harvested the human body heat into a sustainable energy source. The electricity generated was then fed to a computer to mine cryptocurrencies.

Markets in the U.S. are beginning to show signs of life thanks to the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing plus the recently enacted $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 23 percent and the S&P 500 index has gained around 20 percent from their respective March 23 bottoms. Yet, a conclusion to the wide-reaching COVID-19 pandemic is far from over.

Australia’s equity benchmark ASX 200 index is off by 31 percent and Japan’s Nikkei 225 has lost 21 percent from their February highs as the COVID-19 outbreak went from bad to worse over a month ago.

Government measures in Australia got a whole lot more stringent overnight. The country’s prime minister announced gatherings were to be restricted even further to a maximum of two people in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 from within its borders. The unprecedented measure were agreed to by the newly created “national cabinet,” comprised of the premiers of all the states and territories plus the prime minister and convened to coordinate a battle plan against the virus.

So far, the ASX has been slow to react. The index is up by about 2.3 percent on the day. However, pressure toward the downside is apparent. Gains may require significant positive day-on-day returns over the course of this week if they are to signal confidence in the country’s latest measures.

Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic, said that despite the turmoil the “corona moment” would be the moment we learned to be truly digital.

“While all market signs point to a long and lean winter, the silver lining is that remote working and especially socializing is clearly the catalyst to mainstream the digital experience,” Chu said.

“From church services to dance parties, group meditation to infant play groups, the digital experience is normalizing for all sectors of society. This experimental phase, driven by a survival instinct, is fundamentally ushering the masses to the “digital-first” future,” Chu added.

In commodities, oil is trading at lows not seen since February 2002. Gold is down half a percent from March 27’s close and is showing signs of extreme volatility amid the uncertainty, currently changing hands for around $1,616 per troy ounce.

Bitcoin struggles to gain higher ground

BTC's lower highs are a cause for concern Source: TradingView

Bitcoin prices’ resistance near $6,900 is presenting a significant hurdle for the world’s bellwether cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency suffered continual losses last week, with prices down $1,000 from that local peak. Bitcoin is currently changing hands for around $5,900.

Further, two long-term moving averages (MAs), the 200-day and 100-day, are beginning to converge once more. That indicates the potential for a deeper drawdown from Feb. 13’s high of around $10,500, reflecting sentiment on current global market conditions.

The last time these two MAs crossed was back in November 2019, when prices fell nearly a quarter to a local bottom of around $6,425 from $8,500.

Elsewhere in crypto, XRP is down 3.6 percent over the weekend. Ether (ETH) is currently trading 4.1 percent lower than March 27’s close of around $131.

Global financial sentiment will need to continue to improve significantly in the coming week if there is any real chance of staving off a deeper recession. In the past week, almost all markets have suffered daily lower highs, taken by technical traders to be a negative signal.","Riot Blockchain is worried COVID-19 may “seriously disrupt” its bitcoin (BTC) mining operations.

The Nasdaq-listed rig builder revealed its concerns in its annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed Wednesday. Such reports always include a “general risks” section detailing worst-case business scenarios. This year, Riot added two pandemic-specific subsections to discuss COVID-19.

Riot Blockchain is getting thrashed by the response to COVID-19, the general risk section shows. Its workers are being quarantined and going into self-isolation while its supply chain is seizing up under border restrictions and factory closures, according to the filing.

It also has the unwanted label of being a “nonessential business.” According to the 10-K, Riot has not been classified as an essential business in any of “the jurisdictions that have decided that issue to date.” That potentially cuts off access to Riot’s offices and mining rigs.

“If we are unable to effectively service our miners, our ability to mine bitcoin will be adversely affected as miners go offline,” Riot wrote.

Riot’s concerns echo issues Chinese mining farms faced nearly two months ago. In early February, PandaMiner Chief Operating Officer Abe Yang told CoinDesk his company had difficulty operating some of its farms due to quarantine controls in certain provinces because they had limited staff repairing machines and running the hardware.

At present, Riot’s Oklahoma City operation features 4,000 Bitmain S17 Pro Antminers purchased over December 2019 for $6.35 million total, according to two press releases issued at the time. Those rigs replaced Riot’s older fleet of about 8,000 S9 models, now offline, the 10-K shows.

The “catastrophic” business ramifications of COVID-19 are hardly unique to Riot Blockchain; nearly every business is facing an existential threat that only four months ago would have sounded absurd.

It’s an open question where all this will lead. Riot admits that the pandemic’s “sweeping nature” makes it next to impossible to predict the long term impact. One thing is certain, though:","Coronavirus might be the biggest story of the decade, but climate change will be the grand narrative of the century.

As energy of any kind becomes of premium value to the planet, and the world’s transport systems come onto the electric grid, how will notoriously energy-hungry processes like bitcoin fare?

In financial services, environmental, social and governance (ESG) is becoming the new buzzword among impact-minded corporations. An example of this was the latest letter from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink promising a fundamental reshaping of finance.

Bitcoin, although it’s also about fundamentally reshaping finance, has earned a bad reputation when it comes to energy use, thanks to the vast number of specially-designed computers needed to carry out its mining process.

Read more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global Warming

How you choose to interpret bitcoin’s energy consumption depends on your perspective. Bitcoin supporters might point out that PlayStation, for instance, uses up about as much power as the Bitcoin network, according to research by Bitwise Asset Management. The reinvention of money, they’ll add, is a much loftier goal than playing FIFA 20.

On the other hand, the Greta Thunberg generation may question what appears to be just another financial trading instrument – but one that consumes as much electricity as Chile, a country with 18 million people.

The recent meltdown in markets caused by coronavirus raises other questions about bitcoin’s place in the world. Bitcoin, sometimes described as “digital gold,” was always seen as a safe haven for investors, un-correlated as it was with the rest of the financial system. But the coronavirus shock saw bitcoin fall even more precipitously than the stock market. Its recent ebbs and flows have mirrored that of the S&P 500.

As economist and author Frances Coppola puts it: “If bitcoin can no longer be used as digital gold, what can it be used for?”

Wall Street’s cold feet

Some would argue the gradual encroachment of institutional money into bitcoin as a high-yielding alternative asset class comes with its own cost: a newfound correlation with the rest of the financial system.

Indeed, there has been an assumption from some quarters of the crypto world that it’s only a matter of time until swathes of institutional investment will flow into bitcoin. This will follow as the network becomes more regulated, they say, and things like dedicated exchange-traded funds (ETFs) emerge.

But with a firm focus on ESG among institutional investors of any real size, that may not happen after all, at least not at anything like the scale once predicted.

“I think bitcoiners are very much hoping in the future that institutional investors will put their money in bitcoin,” said Alex de Vries, blockchain specialist at PwC. “But it’s very unlikely that shareholders of those institutions will allow companies to invest in high-carbon assets.”

It’s not easy to take the temperature of large-scale buyside when it comes to crypto. When CoinDesk asked some of the largest investment firms if ESG concerns might be a factor regarding bitcoin as a hedge, most of them declined to comment.

It was sort of this niche hippie topic for bleeding-heart liberals and there were certain connotations with ESG that it was largely bullshit.

However, one of the largest retirement funds in the U.S., which asked not to be named, said simply: “Things like bitcoin don’t fit into our portfolio.”

Within the confines of crypto, the question of ESG in relation to bitcoin does occasionally come up but it’s relatively rare, said Matt Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise Asset Management.

“I would say it comes up in one out of every 20 serious conversations,” he said.

However, Hougan conceded ESG is certainly the topic du jour, and he expects to hear it mentioned more often.

“I fully agree that ESG has entered a sort of new era in 2020. It’s the combination of Larry Fink’s letter, of the Australia wildfires, the California wildfires, Greta’s popularity. I do think it’s top of mind. I’ve overheard ESG investing conversations in coffee shops here in the U.S., which I’ve never done in the past,” Hougan said.

That said, it’s probably fair to say the bitcoin community, for the most part, is not too concerned about environmental issues.

For example, Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of crypto-focused investment firm CoinShares, pointed out that ESG and environmental sustainability tends to come in cycles; it was a big topic 10 years ago, then it died down and now it’s big again, she said.

“Historically, ESG had sort of been a backwater of investing, where you got sent if you weren’t fit for front office,” said Demirors. “It was sort of this niche hippie topic for bleeding-heart liberals and there were certain connotations with ESG that it was largely bullshit.”

ESG community

ESG warriors perhaps share some similarities with the crypto community: Both are growing and passionate movements, and both could be viewed as extremists by the mainstream financial services sector.

And though some ESG fans see the value in blockchain for being able to track global supply chains, the goodwill does not extend to bitcoin itself.

Lauren Compere, director of shareowner engagement at Boston Common Management, a majority-employee-owned and woman-led investment firm with over $20 billion in assets under management, said millennials and post-millennials want to track how a particular T-shirt is made, for example, or check its provenance using a slavery app.

Read more: Everledger Looks Beyond Blood Diamonds With ESG Supply Chain Collaboration

“I think from an ESG perspective, they are also looking at, ‘How does something like bitcoin fit into the ecosystem?’” said Compere. “What kind of impact does it have on things like climate? Is it a contributor? Is it an enabler?”

Brett Wayman, VP of impact investing at Envestnet, a provider of software to financial advisors, said it’s a question of deciding if the benefit of cryptocurrency as a separate asset class outweighs the negatives of the environmental impacts of Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms.

I think the climate problem will force bitcoin to self-regulate or reconfigure itself.

“Right now I think the environmental impact is pretty extensive. I do think that bitcoin is an interesting investment. But from an energy usage standpoint, my understanding is that it will only become more and more energy-intensive to mine some of these currencies,” said Wayman.

(That likely doesn’t hold for cryptocurrencies based on the less-mining-intensive Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which includes the forthcoming overhaul of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap.)

Martin Vezer, manager of thematic research at Sustainalytics, which is 40 percent owned by Morningstar, said there are clear environmental concerns when a coin relies on mining, which can be quite energy- and carbon-intensive depending on where the electricity is coming from.

“A fundamental question for investors to consider is whether a cryptocurrency is a commodity that actually adds value. In the early trends that we see, a lot of people appear to be buying and selling cryptocurrency as a short-term bet rather than a long-term investment. Sure, this gamble has paid off for some, but others have lost money,” said Vezer.

Responsible investors typically look for long-term opportunities with a clear value proposition rather than a short-term betting opportunity, Vezer added. “They weigh the environmental and social risks associated with an asset before adding it to their portfolio,” he said.

Renewable reputation?

While much of the data is based on estimates, it’s thought that close to 75 percent of bitcoin mining is fuelled by renewable energy.

Bitcoin miners are nomadic and will migrate to the cheapest sources of energy. Over half of all bitcoin mining takes place in China’s Sichuan province, which has excessive hydropower capacity.

The portability of bitcoin mining rigs allow for interesting innovations such as consuming wasted energy from oil wells. In such cases, trapped gas is vented into the atmosphere or burnt off by flare towers because it’s not deemed worthwhile to capture and transport.

Steve Barbour, the founder of Upstream Data, which operates bitcoin mines on oil fields in Canada, has even described bitcoin mining as a “conservation machine.” The vented gas fuels a generator that the mining computers are plugged into. It’s a relatively low capital expenditure for an oil company, said Barbour, especially when presented with the prospect of future BTC returns.

Read more: Yale Researchers Turn to Hyperledger to Track Carbon Emissions

Upstream Data is planning bitcoin mining trials with Canadian Natural Resources, a Toronto Stock Exchange-listed oil and gas producer that reported over $21 billion in revenue last year, Barbour told CoinDesk.

“What we are doing with bitcoin mining reduces venting of methane into the atmosphere,” he said. “It’s an example of how an ESG narrative around bitcoin is at least incomplete.”

However, Martin Wainstein of the Yale Open Climate project, an advocate of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology generally, said he remains skeptical of such “green” endeavors.","Jihan Wu, the co-founder and chief executive of mining rig manufacturer Bitmain, says he’s optimistic that Bitcoin can perform well this year in spite of the coronavirus outbreak.

In a new interview with the Chinese crypto outlet 8BTC, Wu says central banks’ efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic through bailouts and loose monetary policies could drive the price of all financial assets higher.

But Wu says he doesn’t expect the king cryptocurrency to go on a bull run until well after the May 2020 halving.

“I think the bull this time may not come immediately after the halving. There will likely be a delay in time…

As bitcoin’s market cap grows, its volatility decreases and becomes more stable. That means we may not see abrupt spikes in its price.

No matter how high bitcoin goes, one day it will reach the top. Before that, it will see price [with] flatlining growth with lots of twists in the next few years.”

The chief executive of the Bitcoin mining giant also says he doubts Bitcoin will ever act as a safe-haven asset in a volatile global macro environment.

As for Ethereum, Wu is optimistic about the prospects of the second-largest cryptocurrency. Although he believes Ethereum developers are moving at a slow pace, he says the smart contract platform is “untouchable” with first-mover advantages in areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi).","Porn Industry Thrives During Lockdown — These Sites Are Cryptocurrency-Friendly

Porn sites have been experiencing increased traffic as the number of people under lockdown or quarantine rises due to the coronavirus pandemic. Many of these sites accept cryptocurrencies, including Pornhub. The popular porn site currently offers residents of some countries free premium membership for a limited time to help them stay home during the covid-19 outbreak.

Porn Site Sees Surge in Traffic Amid Coronavirus Lockdown

Lockdown and social distancing have increased traffic to adult websites, many of which accept cryptocurrencies. Recently, one of the largest free porn sites, Pornhub, began offering free premium membership to users in countries currently undergoing a coronavirus lockdown or quarantine, including France, Spain, and Italy. Premium membership offers benefits such as exclusive content, no ads, faster streaming, and high-speed downloads. Since last week, users could sign up using the site’s special “stay home” page and enjoy free content for a month. Immediately after the company announced this offer, its site’s traffic spiked. According to the company, more than 120 million people visit its website daily before the spike.

Moreover, the platform recently revealed that about 10% of its performers on Modelhub have opted to be paid in cryptocurrencies. Pornhub began heavily exploring accepting cryptocurrencies after Paypal stopped payouts to thousands of models last year. In January, the company announced that it had added USDT as a payout option. Users can also pay for premium membership with horizen, tron, or verge. Alternatively, they can pay via Pumapay, a crypto payment solution provider.

Cryptocurrency-Friendly Adult Sites

Besides Pornhub, several other large porn sites also accept cryptocurrencies. Among them is Sexlikereal (SLR) which focuses on virtual reality experiences. Subscription to this platform can be paid in over 50 cryptocurrencies through Coingate, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, XRP, ether, nano, and tron.

Similarly, Livejasmin and Manyvids also accept a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Livejasmin specializes in live streaming and webcam shows. Manyvids is a Canadian adult entertainment video hosting, live streaming, and e-commerce company. Other porn sites that accept cryptocurrencies include Naughty America, Chaturbate, and Camsoda.

Meanwhile, some adult film stars are openly pro-cryptocurrencies. Brenna Sparks, for example, has been relentlessly promoting cryptocurrencies to her co-workers and peers throughout the industry.

In the darkest days of humanity, only rare things will have value. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can become the vaccine from the financial crisis.

Due to the coronavirus attack and democracy constant fail across the globe, banks now can dump your data to anyone. The corporations and governments are taking away more rights under the cover of safety measures. However, total exposure to social interaction maps will only make people hide more and trust the government less. In a search for coronavirus vaccine, the government is more than happy to quickly forget your financial rights too.

It doesn’t matter whether they want to track anybody not paying the taxes, or it’s about tracking coronavirus victims. Hundreds of people are escaping home quarantine when there’s an important reason for the surveillance measures. They will definitely escape the surveillance without such reason, and the coronavirus is not here forever.

The banking industry is easy to disrupt thanks to centralization. The development of Bitcoin was decentralized from the beginning. Back in 2009, there was no GitHub repository, and the developers were keeping Bitcoin Core wallet as the RAR archive in the public chat. And of course, on their own PC’s. Later, the client code was attached to GitHub, but still, it got a lot of followers and coders who peer-reviewed. The repository was in development by dozens of people from across the planet. The uniqueness of such a project was in the fact that the people working on it didn’t even know each other.

Qualities of Bitcoin Allow It to Be a Crypto Vaccine from Financial Crisis

Bitcoin has a limited monetary supply, which is 21 million coins. It’s not like the U.S. dollar and the majority of fiat currencies. Bitcoin gains even more scarcity over time, which is a sign of so-called ‘deflationary currency’. The network is generating fewer new coins after years pass. And the fiat monetary system is generating more and more of the paper money. Such behavior leads to a crisis.

During the crisis, only the rare things matter. Like gold, honey, silver, wood, food, toilet paper and… cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin development looks strange compared to the classic development scheme. Usually, the team is sitting in the same office. And the GitHub is a measure of convenience and transparency, not the last hope for efficient communication. But Bitcoin was never about classic solutions.

Many of the 20th century’s classic banking practices are not in the use anymore. For instance, the bank secrecy of the account operations is not here anymore. The majority of the countries have signed different agreements to put a stop on bank secrecy. In the past, nobody could ask the bank about the transaction details, quality and quantity of accounts you have, and so on. Now, banks are dumping the information just like that.

The transparency and privacy of the payment method, as well as coin scarcity, always made people aware of Bitcoin. From one side, blockchain shows off all of the transactions. From the other one, it doesn’t show the names of the senders and the receivers.

Depending on what you need most – transparency or privacy – you can use the blockchain in both directions. A powerful network of miners and nodes not knowing each other will make sure that your transaction is safe. Despite Bitcoin’s transactions became slow and expensive over time, people are ready to use it because it is still better than using a bank wire.

In the Crisis, Best Things Emerge among People

Bitcoin emerged after the crisis of 2008. Some people understood that the banking system will not withstand one more debt hole. This time, it’s the coronavirus crisis, not the debt one. But the governments worldwide are printing fiat papers more and more.

Tyler Winklevoss, one of the pioneers of the crypto industry and Gemini exchange co-founder, claims that the crypto number 1 is the financial vaccine, which could save you from the outcomes of the printing press age.

Bitcoin is the only vaccine in the world that can give you immunity to the money printing disease. — Tyler Winklevoss (@tylerwinklevoss) March 26, 2020

Not only the American dollar, but Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Russian ruble, the Euro, and a hefty of other currencies receive a ‘quantitative easing’ boost. How will the world come out of the coronavirus crisis if money cannot generate the cure?

Sure, people will receive help, in a form of government payouts (like in the U.S). Or maybe they’ll just have the right to avoid paying all the percentage on their credit cards. But the products will cost more over time, making the quantitative easing inefficient. And still, there’s no cure.

The most substantial value is not in the paper. It is not even in the toilet paper. It is in hardcore protection, and survival, in the days of coronavirus attack. So, people who have food, alcohol, shelter, and supplies will win. As per the large corporations, especially the ones working on the car industry, in tourism, and in beauty space… unfortunately, they lose. Nobody to blame, expect the world to turn upside down again and again.

What Could Drain Bitcoin’s Power on a Path towards Adoption?

Bitcoin has a lack of scaling solutions, there is no new, privacy-related code too. And the issue of development centralization is emergent as never.

A lack of scaling solutions means that, even if people will rush to buy Bitcoin, there is no enough space in the block to perform all the transactions. Even when 40% of the network’s transactions are going through SegWit/Lightning, the network’s TPS is very low compared to any other crypto.

The lack of privacy-related code means that the developers are not taking any measures against surveillance software. More and more people are getting to jail thanks to Chainalysis and Crystal. You should be extremely careful when dealing with crypto these days. Exchanges are tracking coins, and if you had some ‘dirty’ one, they freeze payments and even report to police (sometimes). Only when Bitcoin improves privacy, many of its initial fans will come back. As well as the crowds of new adherents.

The issue with code development is that even the OG’s of the industry have absolutely no idea who are the people who contribute code today. The industry is rolling on a special kind of truth generated by the developers, and the public persons, of this space. They are trying to assure the public that Bitcoin has no flaws with scaling. But many of the technical specialists claimed that Bitcoin’s development standards are far from being ordered. For instance, it is hard to join the Bitcoin Core inner circle of the development if you are not familiar with one of them. The good old days when anybody could participate are over.

These are not conspiracy theories, even Andreas Antonopoulos claims that Bitcoin in 2019 is having a lack of competitive privacy model. What will happen in 2020 when Monero, Beam, Grin, Dash and Zcash are all around?

In 2019, cryptocurrency-related fraud and theft have resulted in a loss of around $4.4 billion. Among all crypto fraud and theft incidents in recent years, the most common way used by hackers was to find security errors in the cryptocurrency wallet of their target users.

Keeping the cryptocurrency wallets secure is very important for all those people who are going to use various crypto wallets for the first time and are unaware of security risks related to crypto wallet usage.

As a beginner in cryptoverse, you must understand that if you want to send, receive or simply store your cryptocurrency, you will need a Cryptocurrency wallet. Crypto wallets also help you safeguard your digital currencies from possible crypto hacks. But, that doesn't mean crypto wallets are completely secure for you.

Crypto Wallets Have Risks Too

Many naive crypto wallet users trust the promise of blockchain technology in creating a secure system for users where someone can't hack into your cryptocurrency and steal it. Blockchain is indeed a model of internet security since it is underpinned by a distributed ledger that creates a chain of immutable records.

But, you must know that the security promise offered by revolutionary blockchain tech doesn't automatically apply to your crypto wallets. There is a surprising risk associated with crypto wallets usage and this is not because of blockchain. In most cases, the security risk related to your crypto wallet arises because of your wallet or exchange provider. Wallet providers often track the information you provide to them while signing up.

As competition is continually growing among crypto wallet solution providers, companies seek more information about their customers so they can provide more personalized product offerings. Similar to digital wallets in real-world, tracking software is used by many companies in their crypto wallet solutions today to seek information about crypto wallet users - their search history, email or web activity information so they can identify what customers actually want and can deliver the exact results.

This means the secure private keys generated by users of crypto wallets are also not secure. Combining the information traced by marketing companies and data collected by wallet solution providers, hackers can easily sneak into your crypto wallets.

Hence, it is very important for beginners in the crypto space to take full responsibility for safeguarding their funds stored in the crypto wallet.

To help you achieve this, the article would highlight the key security issues and risks related to crypto wallets usage, how to choose a crypto wallet safely and key measures to safeguard your crypto wallet funds.

But, before moving on to the actionable insights related to how to make you cryptocurrency wallet secure, let’s first try and understand what is a cryptocurrency wallet and how it differs from a digital wallet or eWallet:

Getting the Basics Right

What Is a Cryptocurrency Wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program, designed to store the private and public keys as well as interact with various blockchains, ensuring users can exchange digital currency and monitor their balances easily.

In other words, a crypto wallet allows a particular user to send/receive or exchange bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies with others easily. If you want to send/receive bitcoin or any other altcoin, you simply need a crypto wallet.

How Does It Work?

Now, that you have got the basics covered, let’s understand how crypto wallets work:

Unlike the real-world physical wallet, your cryptocurrency is not stored in the digital wallet in a physical form. Instead, it is digitally stored on the blockchain - a revolutionary,

ground-breaking technology that contains an immutable, circular record of every single transaction incurred on the network, including the total account balances held by each wallet address. The software inside the crypto wallet is directly linked with blockchain and allows you to submit transactions on the blockchain ledger. The wallet is responsible for the generation of public and private keys for you, without which you won’t be able to access or transfer funds.

So, whenever you send bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, you essentially transfer the ownership of your wallet coins to the other wallet address where the coins are being sent. To access and unlock the funds, the recipient wallet owner must have the private key linked to its wallet address and it must also match the public key/address where you have sent the coins. Remember, no actual exchange of real coins is done here and the transaction will only be recorded on the blockchain along with an update in the crypto wallet balance of you and the receiver.

In layman terms, you can consider the public key of your wallet similar to your bank account number with private key functioning as its PIN without which you won't be able to access or transfer funds from your account. Similarly, in the cryptocurrency world, the private key is used to prove ownership of a wallet address as well as sign transactions to send cryptocurrency from your wallet to others. Whereas, your wallet address or public keys are visible on the blockchain network, which enables other users on the network to find your wallet address and send money to you.

What Are the Different Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets?

Crypto wallets can be mainly categorized into two types - hot wallets and cold wallets. The major difference between the two is that the former ones are connected to the internet or are available online whereas the later ones store the user crypto wallet data in offline mode.

Further, these two wallets can be divided into the following categories:

Online/Web Wallets (Hot Wallet)

These wallets are cloud-compatible and are accessible from any internet-connected device from any part of the world. These wallets offer you extreme convenience as you can store your private keys online - which would be secured by a third-party on your behalf. Although, your private keys are at the highest risk of getting stolen online from online due to hacking attacks and theft.

Desktop Wallets (Hot Wallet)

They are generally installed on your computer system or laptop, just like any other software. Although, desktop wallets are at high risk of getting affected by malware or computer virus. You should install strong antivirus and have a firewall to protect your wallet private keys. Popular examples include Jaxx, Electrum, etc.

Mobile Wallets (Hot Wallet)

These wallets run via an app on your mobile and offer extreme convenience as they can be used for instant transfer of payments to anyone, anywhere using virtual currencies stored in your account. Some mobile wallets also have web or desktop versions. Popular wallet examples include Coinomi, Mycelium, etc.

Hardware Wallet (Cold Wallet)

Hardware wallets store user’s private keys on a hardware device like a USB. As users’ private keys are stored in some physical device, they offer the highest level of security and are least vulnerable to online attacks. Many crypto users consider them the safest option to store their digital money. Hardware wallets can be connected to a PC and also compatible with several web interfaces. To send currency from a hardware wallet; you just need to plug your device to an internet-connected PC or device, enter a pin and send currency. Popular examples include Trezor, Ledger Nano S, etc.

Paper Wallet (Cold Wallet)

Similar to hardware wallets, these offer top security and are easy to use. The term paper wallet generally denotes a physical or printed copy that contains your wallet public and private keys. In more technical terms, it refers to a piece of software that is used to securely generate a pair of private and public keys, which are then printed. Using a paper wallet is straightforward for anyone.

How a Crypto Wallet Is Different from a Traditional Digital Wallet/eWallet?

Despite millions of people across the world using cryptocurrency wallets, there is still a misunderstanding when it comes to understanding how they differ from traditional digital wallets:

Let’s understand each in detail:

A Cryptocurrency wallet is essentially a software program that enables users to send, receive or store a myriad of cryptocurrencies or digital currency. It also enables users to monitor their crypto balances. These wallets also store the private and public keys of a user and interact with various blockchain so that users can send or receive cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, a digital wallet or e-wallet is a software-based program or system that securely stores users’ payment-related information in a secure environment and eliminates the need to enter account information manually for users, every time they make online payments.

E-wallet allows you to store payment details like credit card, debit card information, bank account information, etc. for making faster payments. E-wallets can also work as the main interface for using cryptocurrencies for users if they come with built-in features to interact with various blockchains.

Note: Digital wallets also act as the main interface for using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for users if they come with built-in support for crypto storage or exchange.

Here’s the difference:

Unlike digital wallets and traditional “pocket” wallets, a cryptocurrency wallet does not store any currency. All that exists in a crypto wallet is a record of users’ crypto transactions that are stored on the blockchain network - which might be visible or invisible to other users, depending upon the blockchain type - public or private.

Crypto wallets store the public and private keys of users engaged in the crypto exchange. Such a facility is simply available from a typical digital wallet.

Unlike a typical digital wallet, a crypto wallet has an interface that allows it to interact with various blockchain for sending or receiving crypto on behalf of users.

Digital wallets can be linked to a bank’s mobile app or any payments platform like Paypal or Alipay, which is simply unavailable in case of crypto wallets.

Examples of Cryptocurrency Wallet Scams in the Crypto Industry

Now that you are fully aware of the working of Crypto wallets and how they differ from traditional digital wallets, let's look at some of the scams in the crypto industry to give you an idea about the security risks associated with the crypto wallet usage:

Case #1

The most popular example of a crypto wallet hack is last year’s Binance incident. Apparently, the hackers stole $40m worth cryptocurrency from Binance -the world’s biggest digital money exchanges. Binance reported that cryptocurrency theft was made from a single wallet, which was the company’s own Bitcoin hot wallet. Also, cybercriminals stole the API keys, two-factor codes and other information during the Bitcoin attack.

Case #2

The other crypto wallet hack incidents include $10m worth XRP steal made by hackers from GateHub users wallet in June, last year. While providing a briefing about the incident, cryptocurrency wallet service reported cybercriminals were able to breach around 100 XRP Ledger wallets to steal money.

Case #3

A report from Chainalysis at the end of last year highlighted that PlusToken scammers have managed to cash out around $185 million from the total stolen Bitcoin and are also responsible for the steep decline in Bitcoin prices at the end of 2019. Before cashing out money, the hackers made more than 24,000 transfers to 71,000 different Bitcoin addresses using a special kind of wallet that uses a Bitcoin-compatible privacy technology - CoinJoin.

Risks related to Cryptocurrency Wallet Usage

Spoofing

In the case of spoofing, the malware present inside the user system tries to change the sender’s wallet address in an attempt to distract another person to send cryptocurrencies to a wrong wallet address. The crypto wallets with less secure security protocols may often become victims to such hack incidents. Hence, always check the level of security protection a crypto wallet offers to you.

Loss of Funds

As discussed, you need both private and public keys to access your crypto wallet and funds stored inside it. Hence, it is important that you store both keys securely. Keeping private keys in an encrypted form is equally important to minimize the possibility of someone accessing your wallet funds without your permission.

High Transaction Fees

While using crypto wallets, the users also pay to pay transaction charges, which might go up to 50% of the sent amount. Ignoring these things might lead to a big financial loss for you.

Centralized Structure

You must know that the public address of your crypto wallet is visible on the blockchain network (excluding private ones) that can readily be seen by everyone; hence, your wallets are at risk of attacks from hackers.

Reversing Payments

While using crypto wallets for virtual current transfer, always remember to enter the correct public address of their receiver, as transactions once performed on the blockchain cannot be reversed due to its nature. You might lose your money as it will be transferred to a wrong wallet address.

Actionable Insights for How to Secure Your Cryptocurrency Wallet

If you love using crypto wallets, here are some of the important safety measures that you should keep in mind to secure your cryptocurrency wallet and funds stored inside:

Keep your Private Keys Secure

Once someone gets access to private keys or passwords of your crypto wallet, your funds are simply gone. So, always remember to store your private keys safely and make sure no one has access to your private keys or wallet password.

In order to keep your private keys safe, follow these safety tips:

Don't keep your cryptocurrency in an exchange wallet for a prolonged period of time.

Write down your private key in a piece of paper rather than storing it in any electronic device. You should also protect this paper from direct heat to avoid deterioration.

If you are using a hardware wallet, always choose a PIN that is hard to decode for anyone.

Never reveal your crypto holdings publicly under your real name or public address. Some hackers might try to snoop into your crypto wallet to steal your funds even when you keep them in a cold wallet storage option.

Choose a Crypto Wallet Wisely

Always choose a wallet that stores your private keys in an encrypted form online. Crypto wallet solution providers like Corin are offering private key encryption that prevents insider hacking for your crypto wallet. For users concerned about cyber threats, cold wallets are the best solution. You can use cold storage wallets like Trezor or Ledger so that cybercriminals stay away from your funds stored inside a crypto wallet.

Make your You’re using a Secure Internet Connection

Majority of the public networks or wi-fi networks are vulnerable and have security flaws also, which cybercriminals can easily take advantage of for hacking your crypto wallet funds. If you're using a hot wallet to connect to your crypto wallet - avoid connecting to a public network. It is recommended that you use your private or home networks. Also, make sure your private wi-fi uses strong encryption like WPA-2 protocol.

Avoid Phishing - Email and Web

In the crypto world, it is common for hackers to perform phishing attacks through email and Google ads, To avoid becoming part of such phishing scams. Always check the emails that you receive from your crypto wallet solutions providers have their domain spelt correctly and try to avoid logging into their website by clicking on the Google Ads. Remember, once your private key is exposed to a phishing site, your crypto funds are gone.

Cross-check the Wallet Address

Make sure when you connect to an exchange or hot wallet, you're logging into the right address- the one provided by your wallet solution provider. Also, log in to websites only that are using a valid HTTPS certificate. Most legit sites have HTTPS secure. For extra safety, try browser plugins like “HTTPS Everywhere”

Keep an Eye on Auto-updates

It's always recommended to turn off auto-updates while using web apps related to the crypto wallet. The bugs arising in new software updates can cause massive losses for you as a crypto wallet account holder. Wait for 2 or 3 days to track any potential issues in the new release of the crypto wallet app or software. Once the app is tested by other users, you can install it without any risk.

Use Strong Passwords

52% of people use the same passwords for different online services. Hence, when using a digital wallet for crypto storage or exchange, make sure you use strong passwords that can't be guessed by hackers easily. Avoiding putting your personal information like name, DOB, etc. in your wallet password. Also, you can use fingerprint authentication for your crypto wallet app while transferring money to others.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

You should always enable the two-factor authentication functionality if provided by your crypto wallet solution provider. Better you choose crypto wallet solutions that offer this functionality by default. Remember, two-factor authentication is done in different ways by different wallet providers. For example, A Google authenticator app uses a 6 digit code that changes regularly and is unique for every user. Also, whenever possible, use wallet solutions with software or hardware 2FA rather than SMS.

Separate Your Crypto Funds

Spread your total cryptocurrency wealth across multiple wallets - no matter hot or cold to minimize the loss in case of a hack.

Backup your Crypto Wallet Regularly

It is always a good idea to backup your crypto wallet in case you lose the device that is used to access your crypto wallet. Also, make sure the backup is sold in a safe location. Backing up your crypto wallet helps you in the easy restore of your wallet with all-important account details intact.

Now, the Major Question - Are Cryptocurrency Wallets Really Safe for Beginners?

Well, the answer is both a yes and no! If you perform a transaction on the blockchain, it simply can’t be reversed and If the hackers somehow get access to your crypto wallet private keys, it would not be possible for you to do anything in such a case. For this reason, you as a beginner in the crypto sphere might get worried.

But, not be disappointed completely. As blockchain is a new and evolving technology, compared to other techs, researchers and developers are working hard to figure out every possible solution for security loopholes in virtual money transfer on blockchain networks. A lot of firms are coming up with new and advanced options, i.e., private cryptocurrencies, AI-based wallets, etc. to safeguard users’ crypto wallet funds.

Also in most of the big crypto hacks or scams, the online exchanges attacked and reimbursed their victims. So, the chances are always high that you will get your hard-earned money back if you store funds with reputed online wallet solution providers like Binance, Coinbase, etc.

Summing Up …!

2020-03-30,"U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken conducted a user poll, which revealed that traders are expecting Bitcoin to break new highs before 2021. The poll received 400 responses, which erred mostly on the side of bullishness.

Out of the respondents, a mix of mostly cryptocurrency investors and traders, the average Bitcoin price target came in at $22,866. The respondents were also comprised of 84% who managed less than $10 million in capital, 11% managed between $10 million and $50 million, and 6% divided evenly between traders who managed between $50 million to $100 million and traders with more than $100 million.

“The overall market sentiment is slightly bullish, with 44% of participants stating that the cryptocurrency markets are in a bull market, while 22% believe we are in a bear trend and 34% stating they are unsure,” a CoinTelegraph report noted.

“There was little consensus among traders as to what will accelerate crypto’s growth over the next 12 months, with the top answer comprising “adoption” with 19%,” the report added. “Bitcoin’s upcoming halving came second with 15%, followed by political “conflict” with 11%, “fear of missing out” with 11%, and economic “crisis” with 9%.”

On the topic of adoption, the federal government recently floated the idea of a digital dollar in the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by Congress to blunt the economic effects of the coronavirus. According to the actual bill introduced, the digital cash option would represent “a balance expressed as a dollar value consisting of digital ledger entries that are recorded as liabilities in the accounts of any Federal [R]eserve bank; or an electronic unit of value, redeemable by an eligible financial institution (as determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).”

“Member banks with total consolidated assets in excess of $10,000,000,000 shall promptly offer individuals the ability to apply, through online or telephonic means, for a pass-through digital dollar wallets,” the text states.

Bitcoin Price data by YCharts

Respondents also cited the “halving” event to support crypto bulls’ assertion of higher prices in the future. The idea is that less incentives for Bitcoin miners will introduce scarcity to the leading cryptocurrency, which in turn, will drive up prices.

In essence, the halving event could be the digital currency’s form of a stimulus package. However, there’s no guarantee that this can catapult Bitcoin to higher levels, but nonetheless, it gives the bulls some hope.

“There are certainly some events that could help to drive the cryptocurrency’s price higher in the future, such as the “halving,” which will cut Bitcoin’s mining rewards in half and reduce its pace of new coin creation,” Joe Tenebruso wrote in Motley Fool. “But prices could also continue to fall, so there are plenty of risks to consider if you choose to buy today.”

The top cryptocurrency by market value picked up bids near $5,850 during the Asian trading hours and rose around $500 to $6,344 at 07:14 UTC. At press time, the global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, was at $6,290, up 7 percent on the day.

Bitcoin found takers even though stocks in Asia dipped alongside losses in S&P 500 futures, possibly over renewed fears of a prolonged coronavirus-led lockdown across the globe.

President Donald Trump abruptly abandoned his talk of life returning to normal in some parts of the U.S. by Easter and instead extended social distancing rules through April. That forced markets to price in the possibility of a deeper economic slowdown in the world’s largest economy.

European equity markets are also trading in the red at press time, with the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and France’s CAC index reporting 0.5 percent declines.

Bitcoin decoupling?

Bitcoin putting in a positive performance as stocks suffer may bring cheer to investors and analysts who believe the cryptocurrency is a safe haven asset like gold.

However, it’s still too early to say the cryptocurrency has now decoupled from equities. After all, the 90-day correlation between bitcoin’s price and the S&P 500 rose to 0.52 earlier this month, the highest level on record, according to Arcane Research.

Further, with the virus outbreak showing no signs of slowing down, investors may continue to hold cash (U.S. dollar). Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe the economic fallout in the west has only just begun. Meanwhile, central banks and governments across the globe look to have run out of ammo, having already fired their big “bazookas” over the last couple of weeks.

As a result, another liquidity crisis, similar to the one seen a few weeks ago, cannot be ruled out. In that case, bitcoin could again feel the pull of gravity alongside the sell-off in stocks.

Some analysts, however, think bitcoin could soon decouple from the traditional markets as macro traders and institutions have already cashed out their cryptocurrency stashes. “We think the correlation to traditional markets will ease now that most cross-asset-class investors have sold out,” Richard Galvin, CEO of Digital Assets Capital Management, tweeted Monday.

Derivatives markets data does show institutions have likely exited the market. Open interest in bitcoin futures listed across the globe has declined by nearly 50 percent from highs above $5 billion seen in mid-February.

Galvin added that the “highly stimulatory and potentially inflationary central bank and sovereign response” could only bode well for bitcoin.

Meanwhile, Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Kenetic Capital, said the Federal Reserve’s “All You Can Eat” quantitative easing plan should prevent future flight from bitcoin as we saw earlier this month.

The Fed announced an unlimited asset purchase plan last Monday to contain the economic fallout from the virus outbreak. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress approved a $2 trillion fiscal stimulus plan on Friday that was promptly signed into law by President Trump.

“Barring any further cataclysmic shocks to the economy, I expect BTC will rally faster and harder than public markets,” Chu told CoinDesk.

What do the charts say?

The immediate bias remains bearish despite the price bounce from $5,850 to $6,350, as a rising channel breakdown confirmed on Friday is still valid, as seen below.

4-hour chart

A convincing move above the horizontal resistance line of $6,342 is needed to invalidate the breakdown and open the doors for a re-test of resistance at $7,000.

Weekly chart

Bitcoin failed to close above the former support-turned-resistance of $6,425 last week.

The bull’s failure at the key hurdle, coupled with consecutive weekly candles with long upper shadows pointing to “sell on rise” mentality, indicates the path of least resistance is to the downside.

Bitcoin would likely slide back toward $5,000 if the buyers fail to defend the Asian session low of $5,850.

The outlook as per the weekly chart would turn bullish if and when prices find acceptance above $7,000.","Bitcoin fell around 9% Friday through till Sunday and the price has bounced back somewhat at the start of the trading week. The market has been consolidating for a while and seems to be lacking any firm direction at the moment. On the hourly chart below the price seems to be stuck between the black resistance (6,983) and the red support (5,750). A strong breakout could be on the cards but who knows when it will occur.

Ethereum price is trading in the green by 6.15% in the session on Monday.

ETH/USD continues to move within a very tight range, breakout looming via the daily.

The price for the last two weeks has offered little direction, but closing in the green.

Litecoin price is trading in negative territory by 4.15% in the session on Monday.

LTC/USD has offered little in terms of price action since 13 March.

Given the narrow conditions, it suggests a big breakout is in the works for Litecoin.

Despite the global coronavirus pandemic, Japan continues to approve more cryptocurrency exchanges to legally operate in the country. The latest one was approved on Monday, bringing the total number of legal crypto exchanges in Japan to 23.

First Approved Crypto Exchange This Year

Japan’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), registered another cryptocurrency exchange operator on Monday. Japan legalized cryptocurrencies as a means of payment under the amended Payment Services Act back in April 2017 and crypto exchange operators are required to register with the FSA. The agency started registering them in September 2017.

The latest one registered by the FSA was Okcoin Japan, the Japanese subsidiary of Ok Group. Founded in September 2017, the Tokyo-based exchange has been approved to trade BCH, BTC, ETH, ETC, and LTC, according to the FSA’s website. The exchange will soon launch; it is currently accepting pre-registrations for account opening.

Okcoin Japan is also a member of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), a self-regulatory organization approved by the FSA. The agency is closely cooperating and exchanging information with the association. The JVCEA has established some self-regulatory guidelines for crypto exchanges to follow.

All 23 FSA-registered crypto exchanges in Japan are “Class 1” members of the JVCEA. The organization also has “Class 2” members comprising companies that are not yet licensed by the FSA, such as Coinbase, Payward Asia, and Wirex Japan.

23 Approved Crypto Exchanges in Total

Besides Okcoin Japan, there are 22 other registered cryptocurrency exchange operators in the country. In September 2017, 11 of them were registered: Money Partners, Quoine, Bitflyer, Bitbank, SBI VC Trade, GMO Coin, Huobi Japan (formerly Bittrade), Btcbox, Bitpoint Japan, Fisco Cryptocurrency Exchange, and Tech Bureau. Tech Bureau was acquired by Fisco after it was hacked in September 2018. However, the two platforms continue to operate independently and are still listed on the FSA’s website as two separate entities.

On Dec. 1, 2017, DMM Bitcoin, Taotao (formerly Bitarg), Bitgate, and Xtheta were registered. Bitocean followed suit on Dec. 26. In 2018, no crypto exchange operator was registered due to the hack of Coincheck, one of the largest crypto trading platforms in the country. The FSA subsequently tightened its oversight of the industry, conducted on-site inspections of exchanges, and revised its method of approval. After the hack, Coincheck was acquired by Monex Group and was finally registered with the FSA on Jan. 11 last year.

In addition, the agency approved five more crypto exchange operators last year. Rakuten Wallet and Decurret were registered on March 25, LVC on Sept. 6, Lastroots on Nov. 27 and Fxcoin on Dec. 24. LVC is a subsidiary of Line Corp., owner of Japan’s most popular chat app, Line. Soon after it successfully registered with the FSA, the company launched a crypto exchange called Bitmax.

According to Thomas Heller, business director of one of the world’s largest bitcoin mining operations, F2Pool, market dips have made it unprofitable for some bitcoin (BTC) miners with older machines to operate.

“We lost 10 percent of our bitcoin hashrate from our clients, for some of our competitors it was closer to 30 percent,” Heller said, referring predominately to miners across Asia and Europe.

Mining operations in North America have also been impacted. Upstream Data founder Steve Barbour, who operates bitcoin mines on oil fields in Canada, said fewer companies are allocating resources to experiment with bitcoin, at least so far.

“Pretty much every Canadian oil producer is basically telling their staff to do nothing and spend no money, and we’re a service provider for those companies,” Barbour said. “We were growing, month by month. This month is flat and I’m expecting next month to be down.”

Likewise, the California-based Digital Farms is closing up shop until the price of bitcoin resurges and makes mining more profitable.

Meanwhile, the coronavirus crisis is hindering the global hardware supply chain.

One anonymous bitcoin miner in Iran said his operations stalled because the sector hasn’t been able to get new equipment into the country. Leading bitcoin miner manufacturers in China started reporting coronavirus-related delays in late January. Although some global shipments have resumed, other supply chains remain backed up.

Plus, due to the upcoming decrease in mining rewards called the halving, some mining operations are shutting off, at least temporarily until prices make their efforts lucrative again.

Heller estimated Chinese miners still contribute roughly 60 percent of the global hashrate, followed by Russia with 15 to 20 percent and North America with roughly 15 percent. Iran’s hashrate share is difficult to quantify due to a lack of official statistics.

Russian miners haven’t been hit as hard by the coronavirus market dip, partially because the Russian ruble was already in dire straits.

The Russian mining operation Bitriver said at least one client moved operations from China to Bitriver’s Siberian facilities earlier this month. A second Iranian bitcoin miner, whose operations are stalled due to tax conflicts, hypothesized many Iranian mining operations will eventually follow suit and move to Russia if the regulatory climate doesn’t improve in Iran.

Perhaps ironically, the bitcoin mining industry in Iran is dwindling despite domestic demand from retail users. Sources on the ground in Iran, once home to a thriving mining industry, say the Middle Eastern nation is no longer hospitable to crypto entrepreneurs.

An anonymous mining pool manager in Southeast Asia said many Iranian miners are looking to move their operations to Russia or “other places with cheap power” since the Iranian government is now proactively focused on taxing mining operations.

As well-resourced Chinese companies build new setups ahead of the bitcoin halving in May, certain geographies could see an uptick in hashrate share.

“Chinese miners are trying to sell large quantities of older S9s [mining machines],” Heller said. “With potential buyers particularly in Russia, the Commonwealth of Independent States region [post-Soviet republics in Eurasia] and the Middle East.”","HIVE Blockchain Technologies, a Canada-based publicly-traded ether (ETH) mining firm, is diversifying into bitcoin mining operations.

Announcing the news on Monday, HIVE said it is acquiring a 30 megawatts (MW) bitcoin mining facility from Cryptologic Corp for about CA$ 4 million (~US$2.8 million) in Quebec.

HIVE currently has ether mining facilities in Sweden and Iceland. The firm said the acquisition would more than double its total available power capacity globally to approximately 50 MW.

“This is an important strategic acquisition for HIVE that diversifies our business significantly, and we are making it at an opportune time at an attractive valuation for our shareholders,” said Frank Holmes, interim executive chairman of HIVE. “The acquisition provides us with an advanced, operating Bitcoin mining facility ready to transition to next generation mining hardware with access to some of the lowest cost electricity on the planet. The cost of US$95,000 per MW is less than half the industry standard build cost per MW.”

In a separate announcement, Cryptologic Corp said it is selling all the shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary Quebec Inc. to HIVE. The 30 MW facility includes approximately 14,000 Bitmain S9 miners.

HIVE said due to the facility’s low electricity prices, these miners generate positive gross mining margins under current market conditions.

The acquisition remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. It is expected to close on the date that is the later of April 3 and the date that is two business days after the date that the TSX Venture Exchange provides conditional approval of the transaction, per the announcement.



The news comes at a time when bitcoin's mining difficulty, an indicator of competition among bitcoin miners, has seen the second-largest decline in the network’s history.","Microsoft has proposed a system that can mine cryptocurrencies using data collected from humans as they exercise or read an advertisement.

In a patent application filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Thursday, the American computer giant said sensors could detect activity associated with specific tasks – such as time spent viewing ads – and convert it into computer-readable data to solve computational problems, in much the same way as a conventional proof-of-work system.

“Instead of massive computation work required by some conventional cryptocurrency systems, data generated based on the body activity of the user can be a proof-of-work, and therefore, a user can solve the computationally difficult problem unconsciously,” the patent application reads.

The system could use physical exertion to mine cryptocurrencies: sensors could detect when the body is doing a physical task, such as a faster pulse, and use that data to unlock blocks. Scanners connected to the head could even use brainwaves, signals sent out during mental exertion, to mine for cryptocurrencies.

Microsoft says the system could be used to incentivize users to perform certain tasks. Scanners can detect activity from certain kinds of tasks, such as mental concentration when reading an advert, that can verify blocks and reward the user with cryptocurrencies.

In late 2017, a Netherlands-based company explored whether humans produced enough energy to mine cryptocurrencies. Their test results found body heat from 37 people, collected over a couple of hours, produced enough energy for a computer to mine continuously for just over eight days.

Although Microsoft designed the system, it is unclear whether the company is moving forward on actually creating it. It is also not clear whether the protocol would run off a fork of an existing protocol, or based on a whole new blockchain entirely.

Though not included in the final package, Congressional Democrats used the debate to push for the creation of a “digital dollar,” that would be backed by the Federal Reserve, along with accounts for every American at the central bank — a historic step forward in support for widespread digital currency use that has been lauded by progressives and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike.

“A digital dollar would be embraced by the crypto community,” said Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors and noted bitcoin bull. “It’s positive because it’s making the world more comfortable with native digital assets.”

A Fed-backed digital dollar wouldn’t be a cryptocurrency based on decentralized blockchain, the ledger-based technology that underpins traditional digital currencies like bitcoin BTCUSD, -2.50% . It would merely be a digitized form of the fiat dollars that the Fed issues, and with which Americans are the most familiar, essentially antithetical to assets like bitcoin, in the eyes of cryptocurrency purists.

Because of this difference, Lee said, a digital dollar would be a compliment, rather than a competitor to bitcoin. “I think the strength of bitcoin would be more obvious, because its more anonymous” than currency the government can easily track.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee and Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee each introduced legislation last week that would require the Fed to create so-called digital dollars and for member banks of its regional satellites to create accounts whereby Americans could access their digital bucks, free of charge. The Fed would then have to reimburse banks for the cost of maintaining these accounts.

A main reason these electronic bills were proposed last week, during negotiations over the $2.2 trillion stimulus package, are the difficulties that the government will have in getting the $1,200 payments that most Americans are owed according to the legislation, because many lack back accounts and the government lacks a current address to send a physical check.

“The poorest lack access to basic banking because payment mechanisms are highly segregated by income, by design,” wrote Aaron Klein, director of the center on regulation and markets ant the Brookings Institution, noting that one out of every 14 households in America have no bank account.

The impact of this state of affairs could have macroeconomic effects, as it will result in a slow distribution of stimulus funds to those who need it most, blunting its impact in an economy that has ground to a halt as governments across the country race to stop the spread of COVID-19.

“My legislation would allow every American to set up a free bank account so they don’t have to rely on expensive check cashers to access their hard-earned money,” Sen. Brown told the American Banker.

While a digital dollar didn’t make it into the final stimulus legislation, that it concept is now being taken seriously by high-profile lawmakers in Washington is another signpost on the road to a digital-money future, said Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize. “The question is not if a digital dollar will be created but when and how.”

He argued that a central bank digital currency could be a useful supplement to the growing ecosystem of cryptocurrencies, or more specifically, so-called stable coins, and firm’s like his which use a form of blockchain technology to digitize other types of financial assets and make their transfer more efficient. “If you have a digital representation of a security, which is what blockchain solves, and a digital representation of a dollar, that enables efficient settlement of transactions.”","Image: ZDNet

A hacker has hijacked tens of YouTube accounts, renamed them to various Microsoft brands, and is currently broadcasting a cryptocurrency Ponzi scam to tens of thousands of users, posing as a message from the company's former CEO Bill Gates.

The hacks are part of a growing issue on YouTube, where hackers hijack popular accounts to broadcast a classic ""crypto giveaway"" -- where victims are tricked into sending a small sum of cryptocurrency to the scammer in order double their earnings but never get any funds in return.

Such scams were once very common on Twitter, but have now moved to YouTube in recent months as Twitter began cracking down on users posing as verified accounts.

At the time of writing, a hacker appears to have taken over 30+ YouTube profiles from where they are live streaming an old Bill Gates talk on startups that the former Microsoft CEO gave to an audience at Village Global in June 2019, but also asking users to participate in a scammy giveaway.

Image: ZDNet

The cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme is currently live streaming on the YouTube accounts using names such as Microsoft US, Microsoft Europe, Microsoft News, and others. Spokespersons for Microsoft and YouTube denied that hackers breached any of Microsoft's verified official accounts, although some users reported scam streams appearing on non-verified Microsoft accounts.

However, the vast majority of live streams were airing on YouTube channels with high subscriber counts, hijacked from YouTube users and later renamed to appear as legitimate Microsoft accounts, in an attempt to amplify the hack and give it an air of legitimacy.

Some of the Bitcoin addresses listed in the scams had received thousands of US dollars at the time of writing, suggesting the scam had fooled at least some users.

Based on YouTube stream stats, tens of thousands have seen the video feeds.

Microsoft was not the only organization impacted by the mass hijack and defacement incident. The Chaos Computer Club, a famous Germany-based hacking community, has also had its account hijacked to broadcast a similar message. The YouTube account of YouTube's founder was also hacked in the same manner in January. Furthermore, the Microsoft CEO is not the only popular figure to have his name abused in this way. Many past crypto-scams impersonated figures from the cryptocurrency community.

2020-03-31,"While bitcoin (BTC) has climbed sharply from recent lows below $4,000, it’s still on track to end March with a double-digit price loss.

The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $6,440, representing nearly a 68 percent rise from the low of $3,867 registered on March 13. Even so, prices are still down 24 percent on a month-to-date basis.

If that loss is held through Tuesday’s close (00:00 UTC), it would be the biggest monthly percentage decline since November 2018. Back then, the cryptocurrency had tanked by 37 percent, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

It’s also the second straight month in the red for bitcoin after an 8.5 percent decline in February.

The cryptocurrency has registered double-digit losses in just two months out of the last 13. Meanwhile, the bulls have managed to produce gains of over 10 percent in five months over the same period.

Why the drop?

Bitcoin, often touted as a safe haven asset, dropped sharply in March despite the coronavirus-led risk aversion in the traditional markets. That’s likely because investors used the cryptocurrency as a source of liquidity.

When panic sets in the financial markets, investors tend to liquidate assets and hold cash, preferably the U.S. dollar, which is the global reserve currency.

Hence, it’s not surprising the dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, has gained nearly 7 percent this month, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. Gold, too, is reporting a month-to-date gain of over 6 percent.

Looking forward

There is general consensus in the market that bitcoin will regain poise in the second quarter, courtesy of U.S. monetary policies.

While the Fed has recently announced an unlimited easing program that will boost supply, bitcoin is set to undergo its miner’s reward halving in May. The process will reduce the daily issuance, or supply, of coins by 50 percent.

“Bitcoin is going to experience its third block halving in Q2. We’re weeks away from an event that has, historically, led to monumental economic growth for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Brandon Mintz, CEO of the bitcoin ATM provider Bitcoin Depot, told CoinDesk.

Meanwhile, Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, believes buying dips and accumulating is the way to trade in the second quarter, because bitcoin has historically performed well in the months following the halving.

Some

analysts expect the massive monetary and fiscal lifelines launched by the

central banks and governments across the globe to strengthen bitcoin’s appeal

as an inflation hedge and a haven asset.

“The insanity that’s guiding today’s public markets is making bitcoin seem quite civilized in comparison, and while short term confidence in Bitcoin was shaken, its long-term fundamentals as an asset class have been strengthened by the speed and quantum of its recovery,” said Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Kenetic Capital.

“I’m looking forward to continued volatility and the possibility of another move down below $6,000 but ultimately recovery and return to $8,000-$9,000 levels in the second quarter,” Chu added.

Confidence seems to have returned to the bitcoin market, as indicated by the notable drop in exchange deposits over the last 2.5 weeks. The slowdown in inflows to exchanges suggests there are now fewer sellers looking to offload their holdings into the rising market.

The derivatives market, however, is biased bearish. For instance, the futures market is in “backwardation” – a condition where the futures price of a commodity is lower than the spot price today.

“Backwardation in the futures market indicates that traders are expecting a price to decline slightly over the coming months,” Luuk Strijers, COO of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, told CoinDesk.

Strijers added that miners are also generating selling pressure right now, with bytetree.com data showing they are selling more bitcoin than they produce, and are not awaiting the upcoming halving.

However, ByteTree’s founder and chairman, Charles Morris, believes that’s a bullish sign. After all, miners wouldn’t hit their own profitability by selling into a market that lacks the strength to absorb the extra supply and fuel a price crash.

What the charts say

From a technical analysis standpoint, the monthly close is pivotal.

Bitcoin turned lower from $10,500 in February, establishing a second bearish lower high (marked by arrows) on the monthly chart.

The pattern would gain credence if prices settle under the December low of $6,425 on Tuesday’s close. That would boost the probability of a re-test of the 50-month average support at $5,200.

On the higher side, a convincing move above $7,000 is needed to confirm a bullish reversal on the weekly chart, as discussed Monday.","Why did this happen?

However, it may be rather difficult to choose the best cryptocurrencies to invest in especially for beginners. According to CoinMarketCap, there are approximately 5,266 digital coins to choose from though not all of them are worth investing.

To make it easier for you, we have compiled a list of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in April 2020 based on their latest developments, price performance and analysts predictions.

The latest crypto market overview

The coronavirus (Covid-19) has affected the entire financial market. Even the crypto industry could not escape from the outbreak, witnessing the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin shedding 58 per cent and falling from $10,500 to $4,679. Shortly after the sudden decline in BTC price, search engines such as Baidu and Google saw an increased interest in buying Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, said in an interview that he disagrees with the fact that the virus caused the crash, putting the blame mainly on the overall market sentiment and adding that the coin’s fundamentals still look strong.

Luckily, the market started recovering again, and, at the time of writing, BTC traded at $6,298.

Meanwhile, global crypto conferences have either been cancelled or postponed to stop the spread of the pandemic. Consensus 2020, one of the largest events in the crypto industry planned for this May, will now be held virtually, giving attendees from all over the world the opportunity to participate online at no charge.

Apart from the coronavirus, there is a piece of good news about crypto regulation in some countries such as India, Iran, and Venezuela, which at first were against the adoption of crypto but are now finally embracing it. Also, Zimbabwe’s government appears to be interested in legalising digital money to improve its financial sector. Moreover, according to the latest data from Statista, the popularity of cryptocurrencies is rapidly growing in Colombia, making the country the third-largest zone of crypto users.

On the other hand, Facebook's infamous Libra project has seen its members leaving the Libra association and joining its key rival known as Celo’s “Alliance for Prosperity”.

The best cryptocurrencies to invest in April 2020

Now that the markets are anything but stable, you are probably wondering what crypto to invest in today to make it a somewhat safe long-term bet. To answer that question, we have prepared a fundamental analysis of the cryptocurrency market to make a list of the top 5 cryptocurrencies with the most attractive potential.

Bitcoin still retains its position on top of the most popular and profitable digital assets.

Although it suffered a temporary setback when its value dropped from $10,000 in mid-February to $4,000 in mid-March, the coin has still managed to gradually appreciate back to $6,298.

According to a famous cryptocurrency and Bitcoin investor Tyler Winklevoss, the digital asset is expected to gain more in value as people across the globe get over the initial shock of the deadly pandemic.

According to Michaël van de Poppe, a full-time swing trader in cryptocurrencies, the market is not bullish yet as Bitcoin did not touch the $6,900 level. He explained: “I don’t feel that Bitcoin is in any bullish market right now, given that we’ve lost pretty substantial support and we didn’t reclaim anything at all.”

However, BTC seems to have the natural tendency to spike up whenever ""it bottoms out”. Thus, it is expected that the coin will live up to its reputation once again in the coming months, making it the top crypto to invest in April.

Ethereum has always maintained its status as another profitable digital coin for investors. At the time of writing, it traded near the starting point of the $125.00-$131.59 range. Analysts are predicting that it is not going to remain at this level for long, expecting the coin to see another uptrend sooner than later.

Between December 18, 2018, and February 6, 2020, Ether has experienced an almost 100 per cent appreciation. It climbed from $115.95 up to $220.81 per coin within the period, making it a great choice for crypto enthusiasts who have invested in this altcoin at the right time.

There are two major factors that are likely to contribute to this asset’s potential growth, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in April 2020. These are:

Projected ETH2.0 launch.

The crypto industry is expecting Ethereum to launch the 2.0 version in July 2020, with the project’s researcher, Justin Drake, being very optimistic about the event finally happening.

An increasing number of miners are accumulating this coin.

Santiment's founder, Maksim Balashevich, expressed his views saying that the alarming rate at which miners are accumulating the coin is proof of the level of confidence they have in it. This may also continue to push the crypto's value up in the coming months and years.

Unlike most digital currencies that target individuals, Ripple was created as a payment alternative to banks and other large financial institutions. Although Bitcoin remains the number-one digital currency, XRP is another popular investment option among modern traders.

Open a trading account in less than 3 min Create account

Currently, XRP is trading between $0.16640-$0.18019. Analysts are predicting a bull run to $0.21608 if the price goes above $0.17468.

Since 2012, Ripple has served its purpose as a reliable payment method. Several banking institutions around the globe have chosen to utilise its innovative blockchain technology. From Banco Santander (SAN) to SBI Remit, J. P. Morgan (JPM) to Bank of America (BAC), Ripple has taken over some industry’s behemoths.

Isn’t it ironic that the institution that was determined to see the end of digital currencies, Ripple inclusive, is at the forefront of its usage? That is one of the significant reasons why investing in this digital asset may not be a bad idea.

Tron is one of the newest kids on the block. It was created in 2017 and has continued its astronomical appreciation since its launch.

At the time of its launch in September 2017, it was sold for 1 cent and had a market capitalisation above $70m. It quickly attracted many cryptocurrency investors, boosting its price to 6 cents three months later.



In 2018, the project became a huge success, as evidenced by the impressive market cap that ranked it among the top 15 cryptocurrencies in the world.



On March 27, 2020, the price of TRX reached $0.0119. Some analysts anticipated that it could achieve the $0.012 level. At the time of writing, it traded at $0.011.

Recently, Tron has partnered with Metal Pay, a cryptocurrency service provider, which indicates a more frequent purchase of TRX in the United States.

Some investment experts predict that the coin would hit $40 by the year's end. Going by its appreciation history, that may come to pass.

Bitcoin Cash is a member of the Bitcoin family. It is another worthy investment option if you are looking for crypto to add to your portfolio. It was introduced as a Bitcoin fork in 2017 and has since justified its creation.

Bitcoin Cash makes the list of cryptocurrencies to invest in April 2020 and beyond. This is because of its potential to appreciate significantly during this year.

Although the digital currency started at $204 at the beginning of January, it currently stands at $217 while experts forecast a rise to $350 at the end of the year.

Crypto market forecast for April 2020

Cryptocurrency experts around the globe are almost unanimous in their predictions. A lot of them believe that all the major cryptocurrencies will be back on track soon, living up to their bullish forecasts. Meanwhile, the latest crypto market review indicates some positive trends and news that are likely to boost the valuations of digital money too.

Hence, digital asset investors can leverage this potential for the appreciation to invest in the top cryptocurrencies mentioned above.

The bottom line

Over the past few years, the crypto market has experienced multiple ups and downs. For that, when choosing which cryptocurrency to invest in, it is always crucial to consider the latest news, market trends, expert opinion and technical analysis.

In previous fiscal interventions, Bitcoin enjoyed hefty price increases.

Outside of a weaker dollar, the imminent halving in May will also reduce sell pressure on BTC.

Share this article

Bitcoin may be primed to take off as analysts suggest that the dollar is about to lose its strength. A weaker dollar would be a positive sign for risk-assets like Bitcoin, offering a ray of hope in a reticent market.

Leading Indicator Points to a Weaker U.S. Dollar

Data from the Wall Street Journal indicates that dollar reserves are usually a leading indicator for DXY, the index that tracks the price of the dollar relative to other fiat currencies. This data shows an inverse relationship between U.S. dollar reserves held and the strength of the DXY index.

Three-month leading reserves for dollars are estimated to be at their highest level since 2015. Coupled with a new round of quantitative easing, there is reason to believe Bitcoin’s price performance will pick up in the coming months.

When the economy is in a tight spot, as it is now, investors tend to flock to cash as it provides a hedge against crashing asset prices. The dollar is the ultimate form of cash, so much so that other countries prefer to hoard dollars over their native currency.

This creates a strong demand for U.S. dollars.

As investors fled to the dollar, DXY saw a near 9% gain as Coronavirus concerns caused distress to global markets and future economic outlook. However, from its peak on Mar. 20, the index is down 4.45% at the time of writing.

Quantitative easing increases the supply of dollars in the market. In reality, there is no way that companies and individuals combined can provide enough demand to soak up incoming dollar supply.

Moreover, there is clear suppression in the strength of the dollar when the Federal Reserve commits to quantitative easing, as shown in the chart below.

When Moon, Sir?

When the dollar weakens, investors move back to risk assets. Stocks, corporate bonds, and even crypto had positive price performance during the Fed’s first three rounds of quantitative easing.

During the second round, which lasted from November 2010 to mid-2011, Bitcoin appreciated just over 24,560%. From the start to the end of round three, Bitcoin made its then all-time high at $1,177 before winding down to $337. Still, it enjoyed a gain of 4,880% over this period.

Money that flows from the Fed may not directly come to Bitcoin, but it contributes to a weaker dollar and thus propels Bitcoin.

There are several positive catalysts for Bitcoin apart from a weaker U.S. dollar. The halving, which is set to take place in less than two months, will reduce the supply of coins in the market and put less selling stress on price.

To make up for this hit to miners, the difficulty of mining has been automatically reduced by the Bitcoin protocol. Together, all of these factors create the perfect storm for Bitcoin.

A weaker U.S. dollar aids the macro narrative for risk-assets like Bitcoin to do well in the next few months.","The trouble with bitcoin payments these days may be a lack of spenders, not spending opportunities.

On Monday, the Silicon Valley bitcoin startup Lightning Labs announced a new standards proposal that makes it easier for companies to automate small bitcoin (BTC) payments, like ongoing subscriptions.

“We are using this product for our Loop service, it’s already in production,” Lightning Labs engineer Oliver Gugger said of the standards proposal called LSAT. “It’s not all the way there. We’ve just proposed the protocol.”

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

LSAT, an open-source feature, is already being used to serve real customers by the startup Tieron, which offers time-stamping services. Gugger acknowledged this and said he hopes Lightning Labs will help establish an industry-standard across different services, from client-facing options like crypto paywalls to backend functions like recordkeeping.

“We lead by example and hope all these different, fragmented protocols that are already out there can become compatible with each other,” Gugger said, emphasizing such standards could ease the way for companies outside the space looking to accept bitcoin payments. The question of what types of services Lightning Labs would enable is still unclear, due in part to the fact current demand is primarily research at crypto startups.

Seeking users

It remains to be seen how, or if, demand will manifest. It’s already possible to integrate crypto payment processing into an established publishing platform in a proprietary way.

Tieron engineer Buck Perley made a related open-source Lightning tool with LSAT, Boltwall. This could theoretically be used to create a bitcoin paywall for content. But no one has asked for this use case yet, Perley said. Instead, most of Tieron’s clients ask for the startup’s time-stamping product, Chainpoint, which utilizes the Lightning functionality.

“You couldn’t really say Chainpoint is a customer, but there was demand for this kind of tool. And Boltwall made it easier for us to implement an LSAT/Lightning-enabled paywall,” Perley said. “I also have a personal belief that the subscription model so many platforms are trying to fall back on is not sustainable in the long run. Having a couple dozen subscriptions across many different kinds of content distribution platforms just feels problematic to me.”

There are free software tools and paid services available for any site that wants to accept bitcoin for digital content, which the Lightning Network experiment Yalls has been for more than two years. Yet so far only a few outlets, such as Forbes, are experimenting with cryptocurrency payments.

CoinDesk itself experimented with crypto tips nearly four years ago. Currently, there are 47,025 publishers that can indirectly receive Brave’s Basic Attention Tokens (BAT), according to unofficial data site BATGrowth. The Brave option is by far the widely used to date. Still, for CoinDesk at least, it’s attracted a mere pittance.

As of January 2020, CoinDesk readers have contributed 19,213 in BAT tips, currently worth less than $3,000, according to CoinDesk Managing Director Jacob Donnelly. It should be noted that CoinDesk hasn’t completed the steps with Uphold (Brave’s wallet provider) to verify corporate identity, he said, so these funds are not under CoinDesk’s control.

Experimental paywalls

Although they remain niche, a handful of adjacent projects are experimenting with crypto-powered paywalls without LSAT.

Forbes, for example, accepts ether (ETH) for an ad-free reader experience, utilizing subscription services from the crypto startup Unlock. Independent reporter Camila Russo also uses Unlock to accept dai stablecoin payments for her newsletter about Ethereum. Russo said “hundreds” of subscribers, roughly 40 percent of her paid readership, use this option. Even among Ethereum fans, most prefer to pay with a credit or debit card.

“I’m still using Substack to publish my content,” Russo said. “[Unlock] doesn’t provide the actual infrastructure to publish the content, so the value proposition with Substack and Patreon is a little different for now.”

So far, experiments for crypto payments like the ConsenSys spoke Civil aren’t sustainable based on subscriptions alone. (Civil CEO Matthew Iles said the startup isn’t ready yet to publish results from their experiments.) Other crypto payment tools have struggled to garner buy-in from the media industry itself.

For example, the anonymous European engineer behind MicroPay said he took the Lightning tool offline for compliance reasons after just one day. It would download content from behind a paywall and send a PDF in exchange for a few cents worth of bitcoin to the engineer’s personal node. Now he’s exploring ways to get outlets to use it to address the audience demand to “read two to three articles max a month” without registering for a full subscription and submitting personal information.

“MicroPay can be used for other things as well, not just paywalls,” he said. “Any service which asks for micropayments can go through.”

Early days

The reason such tools haven’t found product-market fit yet is all about getting the outlets onboard.

As Unlock CEO Julien Genestoux said, outlets want readers’ emails and personal details because they want to send newsletters, sell tickets to events and find other ways to engage with audiences.

“I just want to say the [crypto] wallet in my browser is my identity,” Genestoux said. “Think of a paywall as a membership. … When I transfer [the Unlock non-fungible token] to someone, now they’re a member. I’m not anymore.”

That type of fluid membership is difficult for traditional outlets to monetize. Plus, offering outlets a tool to accept currencies that few people actually want to spend hasn’t inspired much enthusiasm from publishers. Some publishers are also concerned about any extra compliance hurdles accepting crypto might cause, Genestoux said.

On the other hand, niche publishers such as Hard Times CEO Matt Saincome are curious about currency-agnostic options. His online satire outlet uses Coil, an in-browser app made by former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas. Users can load up their Coil accounts with a few dollars worth of credit, using cryptocurrency or credit cards, then read Hard Times content without ads and eventually gain access to exclusive content.

“I’m actually changing the direction of my business to be more geared towards it,” Saincome said. “It’s great because I don’t have to disrupt my ad revenue in order to try this. … Even if they [users] are paying in XRP, I can get U.S. dollars.”

Saincome said Coil isn’t a significant revenue stream yet, but he expects that to change as cryptocurrency gains more mainstream adoption.

“I wish I was a YouTuber right when YouTube was starting. That’s how I feel about Coil,” he said.

On the other hand, some crypto fans are striking out on their own rather than looking to serve publishers.

For example, BSV-focused developer Brad Jasper has roughly 100 user accounts on his closed beta blogging platform that went live in January, Bit.sv. He said at least 1,000 more crypto fans are on the waiting list. Although Bit.sv only pays creators in BSV, the platform can accept bitcoin, litecoin (LTC) or ether as well.","Here are a few things you can do to minimize your bitcoin and cryptocurrency gains and, in turn, your tax liability.

W2s and 1099s have been sent out and tax season is officially in full swing here in the United States. For those operating in the world of bitcoin or altcoin investing, this time of year can have added stress as reporting gains and losses for your crypto trades can be a cumbersome task. While the reporting can be difficult at times, there are many things you can do to help minimize your bitcoin and other cryptocurrency gains and, in turn, your tax liability. This article discusses a few of these tips and tricks.

Open a Crypto 401(k) or IRA Retirement Account

Retirement accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s are popular vehicles used in the world of investing. These types of investment accounts come with tax incentives and can help shield profits from the tax man. By using a retirement account like a self-directed IRA to purchase cryptocurrencies, you can defer paying tax (sometimes you can even pay none at all).

This is contrary to using a traditional cryptocurrency exchange where the income generated from selling or trading crypto is taxed during that same year. Cryptocurrency IRAs can be an effective tax reduction tool — especially if you believe in the long-term value of cryptocurrencies.

Keep in mind that there is a deadline to open and contribute to your self-directed cryptocurrency IRA. The period in which you can make a contribution for a given tax year is from January 1 of that year until you file your tax return. Contributions cannot be made after your filing deadline (i.e., April 15 of the following year).

Look into Using a Specific Identification Costing Method

After the new IRS cryptocurrency tax guidance came out in October 2019, it clarified that specific identification costing methods could be used when calculating your gains and losses for your cryptocurrency transactions provided that you had records to specifically identify your crypto.

This sounds a lot more complex than it is. Essentially, pre-2019, most bitcoin and crypto investors were using the common First In, First Out (FIFO) calculation method to calculate their gains and losses from their trades (the cryptocurrencies that you bought first are sold first) because the IRS had not yet specified whether specific ID was allowed. Now that the new guidance makes this clear, specific identification is a great way to reduce your gains.

In using this strategy, you want to specifically identify and “sell” the cryptocurrencies that you bought at the highest price first. For active traders, this slight change can lead to huge tax savings.

Cryptocurrency tax calculators are especially good at applying these tax minimization algorithms like Highest In, First Out (HIFO) and Last In, First Out (LIFO).

However, before you can use a specific identification method, you have to be able to specifically identify a unit of cryptocurrency as the IRS outlines:

To specifically identify a unit of cryptocurrency, you must have records of the following information:

The date and time each unit was acquired; Your basis and the fair market value of each unit at the time it was acquired; The date and time each unit was sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of; and The fair market value of each unit when sold, exchanged or disposed of, and the amount of money or the value of property received for each unit.

If you have this data for your transactions, you are able to use specific identification methods like LIFO or HIFO which can drastically lower your cryptocurrency capital gains taxes.

Hold for Longer Than One Year

Similarly to the world of investing in stocks, holding onto a cryptocurrency investment for longer than one year pushes you out to the long-term capital gains tax rates. These are typically much lower than the short-term capital gains tax rates which apply when you have sold or traded out of your investment after holding onto it for less than one year.

Additionally, if you are able to identify your cryptocurrencies specifically, you can take advantage of this strategy further. You can specify that the coins you “sell” are the coins that you have held for longer than one year’s time. This will qualify you for the long-term capital gains rate and will help reduce your overall tax liability!

Invest Your Crypto Capital Gains into a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund

Opportunity Zone Funds became part of the tax code with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The IRS defines an Opportunity Zone as an “economically-distressed community where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment.” Put simply, the communities on the receiving end of these funds benefit from revitalization while investors gain tax benefits from investing.

When an investor sells an asset that produces capital gains, he or she can roll any amount of the gain into an Opportunity Zone Fund within 180 days of the sale. The investor can then defer capital gains taxes on that amount until December 31, 2026, or until the Opportunity Zone Fund investment is sold or exchanged (whichever comes first).

For bitcoin investors who have large amounts of capital gains, rolling these gains into an opportunity fund investment can be a powerful strategy for reducing your tax bill.

Use Cryptocurrency Tax Software

Finally, one of the best ways to fully maximize your tax savings on your crypto investments is to plug all of your trade history into a cryptocurrency tax software. Bitcoin and crypto tax software platforms have built-in tools to analyze and optimize your gains and losses reporting for tax minimization. Importing your trade history is as easy as connecting your cryptocurrency exchange accounts. Once your historical trades are in, these programs will then generate your tax reports with the click of a button.

On a 24-hour basis, bitcoin (BTC) was in the green less than a percent Tuesday afternoon Eastern time and ether (ETH) was up slightly as well. The performance of other cryptocurrencies was mixed.

Notable assets on CoinDesk’s big board include decred (DCR) up 3 percent, XRP (XRP) in the green 2 percent and cardano (ADA) gaining 1 percent.

In the traditional markets, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index closed down slightly, less than a percent. Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day up 1.3 percent. In the U.S., the S&P 500 closed New York’s trading day down 1.6 percent.

But for the full quarter, the Nikkei 225 was down 20 percent, the worst three-month showing for the Tokyo-based index since 2008. The FTSE lost 14 percent for the period, its second-worst quarterly performance ever, beating only the fourth quarter of 1987. The S&P 500 was in the red 18 percent to close out Q1 2020, its worst quarter since 1938.

Cryptocurrencies operate 24/7 and don’t have quarters for closing the books. However, bitcoin, the market bellwether, was down just 10 percent for 2020’s first three months.

Semi-correlated?

Despite its relative resilience, bitcoin still has been trending downward over the course of the first quarter along with traditional markets, undermining the narrative that it is a “non-correlated” asset.

“I think correlation across assets is still quite high, a telltale sign of when macro matters more than micro,” said Vishal Shah, founder of Alpha5, a new derivatives exchange backed by large crypto funds.

Indeed, the current period of turbulence isn’t the first time bitcoin has behaved similarly to mainstream financial investments.

“The lack of correlation to equities was a bit premature to announce. We had periods of high correlation, for example, in 2018, when bitcoin fell along with equities in December of that year,” said Siddhartha Jha, a former Wall Street analyst now working on blockchain-focused startup Arbol.

On the other hand, he said, “we have had other periods of higher correlation to gold,” more befitting bitcoin’s aspirations as a hedge against inflation.

Since 00:00 UTC Tuesday, bitcoin has been trading in a tight range of $6,300-$6,500.

“BitMEX open interest remains low, but Coinbase is reporting great inbound activity. None of the typical signs for a crypto bull-run are there,” Shah said, referring to major derivatives and spot exchanges, respectively.

March has produced the lowest level of outstanding positions on BitMEX in 18 months, although the derivatives exchange’s volume has seen gains the past four days prior to leveling off Monday.

Gold dropped over 2 percent Tuesday as of 20:30 UTC, breaking out of its consolidation pattern on heavy selling volume March 31.

The road ahead

While the coronavirus outbreak has dealt a heavy blow to the world economy, analysts are unsure how long it will take for growth to resume.

“Recessions typically unfold over a longer period of time – at least two consecutive quarters,” said Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director of multi-asset platform eToro.

For the time being expect bitcoin’s role to keep switching for traders – it all depends on how other markets perform, experts say.

“The novel-tech part of bitcoin leads to correlation with Nasdaq, especially as many of the investors have overlaps,” said Arbol’s Jha. “Other times it will go with gold. But if equity markets are crashing, that correlation is going to show up very fast.”

How the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar holds up given massive doses of stimulus from Washington is something else analysts are watching keenly.","SAN FRANCISCO & CARDIFF, Wales--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Civic Technologies, a leading innovator in digital wallet solutions, today announced that Civic Wallet is the first and only non-custodial crypto wallet to offer a $1 million (USD) digital currency guarantee provided by Coincover, the leader in high security, risk prevention and mitigation solutions, insured by Lloyd’s of London underwriters.

Cryptocurrency accounting service provider Blox and tax software developer Sovos conducted a survey of roughly 45 Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) familiar with crypto, finding the majority believe their clients might face penalties for misreporting their tax liabilities from their holdings of assets like bitcoin (BTC). Indeed, many of these respondents believe their clients and other crypto holders likely owe back taxes.

“Crypto clients are still alarmingly unaware of how to handle crypto reporting and tax liabilities,” the report generated by the companies said.

According to the survey, the respondents overwhelmingly believe the U.S. will have the most stringent crackdown on crypto taxes over the next year, followed by China. Zero percent of respondents expect Russia to have the toughest crackdown on crypto taxes.

Known unknowns

Part of the issue for taxpayers might be that these individuals still aren’t sure how to file their taxes. Calculating cost-basis has long been an issue for individuals in the space, and Blox CEO and co-founder Alon Muroch told CoinDesk that many payers might not know if they even have the data they need to properly report their holdings.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

“A lot of the software providers out there [didn’t] realize the gap in data, and they simply offered the cost basis calculation without actually verifying the data itself. So, obviously, don’t you put the incomplete data or the wrong data into a [first-in first-out or last-in first-out] calculation, you’ll get different results every time,” Muroch said.

Some of this stems from a record-keeping issue, said Sharon Yip, founder and president of Crypto Tax Advisors. Yip is one of the CPAs who responded to the survey.

“Taxpayers don’t really keep very good records, so when you start transferring costs all over the place, it’s almost impossible to keep track of everything correctly. It’s going to be very difficult to ask exchanges to issue some kind of tax report and and and make it accurate because they just don’t have enough data,” Yip said.

If an individual is conducting transactions exclusively on a single exchange, that might make it easier. Otherwise, exchanges will be unable to provide cost-basis information for other platforms, Yip said.

According to Wendy Walker, a tax withholding and information reporting expert at Sovos, this lack of access to complete data is actually the largest issue facing crypto investors right now from a tax perspective.

“There’s a lot of spreadsheets, there’s a lot of manual transactions going on and that, of course, is not making anyone feel confident about the returns they’re filing,” she said.

This was an issue raised during a summit held by the IRS earlier this month.

Other issues

Adding to the confusion is the fact that taxpayers might file one of several forms, Walker said. She noted the IRS sent warning letters to crypto investors last year, advising them to use a specific form, form 8949, which they would only be able to use if the exchanges on which they conducted transactions sent a 1099-B form.

“The problem is that if they didn’t use a 1099-B, then what’s happening is when they returned, they were receiving a penalty notice from the IRS because the claims that they put on the 8949 couldn’t be substantiated,” Walker said.

It may help to consult with a professional prior to conducting a single trade, Muroch said."
2020-04-01,"Bitcoin and ether are trending down as traditional markets closed in the red Wednesday.

In the traditional markets, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index closed down 4.5 percent. Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day in the red 2.7 percent. In the U.S., the S&P 500 closed New York’s trading day down 4.4 percent.

Traders continue to have concerns about coronavirus’ impact on the world economy, as the World Health Organization says inflections will surpass one million people causing 50,000 total deaths globally in a matter of days.

After holding steady Tuesday, bitcoin slipped from $6,450 at 00:00 UTC Wednesday to as low as $6,160 around 17:00 UTC on exchanges such as Coinbase. An outstanding question is how long the cryptocurrency will continue to track traditional investments during this period of turmoil.

“Bitcoin tends to have periods of spurious correlation with macro risk, but it is not statistically significant,” said Darius Sit, managing partner at crypto fund QCP Capital. “At the time of market panic even gold was correlated with equities but that is starting to break as well.”

Indeed, gold rallied to start Wednesday, and though it did come under some sell pressure it is up less than a percent on the day as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. EDT).

“Gold is one of the best-performing assets in Q1. Gold rose 2.95 percent, which is a great result compared to other asset classes which faced losses,” said, Nemo Qin, an analyst at brokerage eToro.

Where does crypto go from here? Some think the worst is over after last month’s collapse of bitcoin, which briefly dipped below the $4,000 level March 13.

Despite that bloodbath, the first quarter saw bitcoin perform better than the S&P 500 index even though it was still in the red 10 percent for the period.

“For what it’s worth, we believe the lows are behind us in this new macro regime and that expectations have been heavily subdued,” said Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives exchange Alpha5. “At worst, this should lead to the creation of price troughs not too far from here, and at best, provide sustained fuel for a move higher.”

Another open question is whether the upcoming halving of bitcoin block rewards will have its usual effect of boosting the price. For one thing, the options market is expressing pessimism about the halving, expected to occur in mid-May.

In theory, by reducing the amount new bitcoins released into circulation every 10 minutes or so, the halving should juice the price, assuming demand stays constant. But the unusual turbulence, and the way bitcoin has reacted to it so far, calls that assumption into question.

“It’s still a tiny space with low liquidity all over crypto. I honestly have my eyes on hashrate and think a lot about how the halving effect will look this time,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter trader.

In fact, a large U.S. cryptocurrency miner recently shut off its machines, claiming unprofitability at current price levels.

Despite all this, some traders still have confidence in crypto, expecting it to decouple from traditional markets at some point whenever things settle.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, confirmed that the cryptocurrency behemoth is adding a mining pool to their product basket. This news comes less than two months before Bitcoin’s third halving event. No, this isn’t an April fool’s joke.

Binance Announces Mining Pool

The crypto exchange is already a validator for various Proof of Stake networks. Now they’re adding a mining pool for Proof of Work coins, like Bitcoin.

Binance is adding yet another service to its product line, and in doing so, is signaling its ambition to continue expanding within the cryptocurrency industry. In the last two days, Binance has allegedly struck a deal to acquire CoinMarketCap.

Both moves bring about centralization concerns, as Binance and Coinbase jointly operate a lot of vital infrastructure for the cryptocurrency industry.

Binance has an immediate edge over competitors because of its existing user base of over 15 million accounts. Gradually, Binance is turning into a one-stop-shop for retail investors.

From spot and derivatives trading to staking and mining, and even a debit card, Binance has become one of the most important companies in crypto.

Yes, there is a #BinanceMiningPool coming soon. ? A new addition to our suite of #BinanceFinance products we offer including: Staking, Earn, Savings and Loans.#useBNB https://t.co/hYa48hynX4 — CZ Binance ??? (@cz_binance) April 1, 2020

With the halving just a few months away, Binance, led by an unwavering Bitcoin bull, might be joining the mining game to take advantage of BTC price appreciation that is estimated over the next two years.

BNB stands to gain a lot from Binance’s rapid expansion plans. If the company continues to use a portion of revenue to market buy BNB and burn it, it could lead to strong price appreciation as revenue grows and supply shrinks.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s third halving event will take place in roughly 40 days. This date could come earlier or later, however, based on any changes to BTC’s mining algorithm.","An icy mountain in Norway’s Svalbard – an all but inhabitable Arctic archipelago covered in glaciers and inhabited by polar bears – is an unlikely safe haven for cryptocurrency code, let alone a pillar of modern-day civilization.

But it’s here, 250 meters underground in a forsaken coal mine, that GitHub has chosen to store reams of open-source code. That includes Bitcoin Core, by far the most popular code implementation of bitcoin’s underlying infrastructure and one of the most used repositories on GitHub.

As a part of an archiving program for safeguarding an important part of technological history, a “snapshot” of all this code will be copied onto film reels and stored in a steel container, all done in an effort to keep the data alive and unscathed for 1,000 years.

The team is currently getting this data ready. The official deposit into the mountain is planned for late April, a GitHub spokesperson told CoinDesk.

But, while Bitcoin Core is featured, most cryptocurrency projects stored on GitHub will also be included, including bitcoin’s forward-looking Lightning Network, and the code behind other cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and dogecoin.

Organizations like the non-profit digital library Internet Archive and the future-looking cultural non-profit Long Now Foundation are backing the effort, and historians, anthropologists and other scientists are advising it.

Bitcoin and Ethereum coders are fans of the initiative. “The more backups the merrier,” as ethereum developer Ligi put it to CoinDesk.

“I think it’s likely that at some point in the future the electronic record will be lost. It’s all pretty fragile. Preserving some things on hard copy could definitely help avoid a hole in history,” said Wladimir van der Laan, lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core.

The archive potentially provides a way for people up to 1,000 years from now to figure out what on earth cryptocurrency was or how it evolved – if it manages to last a millennium.

“In one sense, this is a fascinating section of financial history that we should preserve for future study,” Avanti Chief Technology Officer and Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop said.

History's limits

While archiving cryptocurrency code could plug historical holes for historians, there are limits to what storing this information will enable.

Van der Laan pointed out that, from a software engineer’s perspective, the code might not make much sense to coders hundreds of years from now.

“As a developer, I do find the idea of a future historian trying to puzzle together our (what goes for) civilization from reams of clever hacks, spaghetti code and context-specific source code kind of amusing,” van der Laan said.

Jason Teutsch, the founder of Ethereum infrastructure project Truebit and a computer science researcher, argued similarly: Explanations of the code should sit alongside the raw material.

“The social, economic, regulatory and academic records depicting motivations and resources for code development may ultimately become more important than the code itself,” he said.

As a part of the program, GitHub will store a guide to using the archive for those in a future time, including descriptions of “most significant” repositories to provide clearer context.

As a developer who hosts a wiki for futurist technological ideas, Avanti’s Bishop is looking to preserve information even further into the future. In fact, Bishop is awaiting a patent for a way to store information inside of DNA. He notes that the genetic instructions guiding an organism’s growth can preserve information for hundreds of thousands of years.

And while this project could help preserve some history, Bishop argues there’s plenty of other important information out there that should be stored in a similar fashion.

“Beyond GitHub, I think they need to seriously consider archiving Sci-Hub, which has over 70 million scientific articles,” Bishop said. “It’s one of the great feats of human intellect and progress, and it needs to be preserved.”","The first quarter of 2020 will be remembered as a period when the coronavirus-led uncertainty set off a liquidity crisis in financial markets, forcing investors to sell everything, including bitcoin (BTC).

The top cryptocurrency, often touted as a safe haven, fell by 10 percent in the first three months of 2020.

While the cryptocurrency eked out 30 percent gains in January amid the U.S.-Iran tensions, it could not withstand the bearish pressures emanating from the global dash for cash in March.

The broader crypto market also suffered losses in the first quarter, as evidenced from the 5 percent decline in the total market capitalization, according to TradingView.

However, a few cryptocurrencies including the privacy coin dash and link, the native token of decentralized oracle network Chainlink, managed to put in a positive performance. Even the most actively traded cryptocurrencies have thin volumes compared to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, so ascribing market movements to fundamentals remains a tricky exercise in this young, speculative market. However, developments such as evidence of real-world adoption or new business partnerships may have played a role in these coins’ gains.

The following are notable winners and losers of the first quarter among 19 major assets featured in the forthcoming CoinDesk Quarterly Review. The list is curated to exclude cryptocurrencies with less than 12 months of trading history, and daily trading volume of less than $5 million. The list does not include stablecoins. CoinDesk Research will publish the Q1 edition of the Review this month.

Winners

Dash

Quarterly performance: +63 percent

Rank by market capitalization: 19

Market capitalization: $606 million

Current price: $64

Dash (dash), the 19th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, jumped nearly 63 percent to register its best quarterly performance since the final quarter of 2017, according to data source Messari Pro.

Back then, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency had rallied by a staggering 217 percent amid the bull market frenzy in the crypto markets.

The latest quarterly gain is largely the result of January’s stellar 180 percent price rise. While the majority of prominent cryptocurrencies outperformed bitcoin’s 30 percent rise in January, dash went a step further by scoring triple-digit gains, possibly due to increased adoption in Venezuela’s hyperinflated economy.

“Dash established meaningful collaborations with international brands including Burger King in Venezuela and Germany. These collaborations, coupled with lower transaction costs and a faster transaction experience than bitcoin, further promote dash’s narrative of day-to-day usability,” said Nemo Qin, an analyst at the multi-asset investment platform eToro.

The team behind dash has certainly been pushing that narrative. “Venezuela is now the world’s leading market for crypto adoption,” Ernesto Contreras, the chief of the Dash Core Group, declared in a blog post on Jan.11.

Some observers, however, challenged the dash community’s claim of massive adoption, accusing the cryptocurrency’s Venezuelan team of fabricating merchant usage numbers. Peter McCormack, host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, said in February that Dash was exploiting Venezuela with propaganda. Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Group countered skeptics with a detailed post outlining dash’s increasing usage in Venezuela.

Taylor’s assurances, however, did not stop the cryptocurrency from taking a hit in February and March alongside sharp losses in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency fell 23 percent in March, but still ended the quarter with outsized gains.

Link

Quarterly performance: +31.5 percent

Rank by market capitalization: 14

Market capitalization: $2 billion

Current price: $2.24

Link, the 14th largest cryptocurrency, closed the first quarter with 31.5 percent gains, having put in dismal performances in the preceding two quarters.

At one point, in early March, the native cryptocurrency of the Chainlink network was trading at record highs above $5.00, representing a staggering 200 percent year-to-date gain.

“Chainlink is benefitting from the shift in focus from base layer smart contracts like Ethereum to oracles, which began in 2019,” Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, a blockchain technology company, said in early March.

A decentralized oracle network built on top of Ethereum, Chainlink connects smart contracts to real-world data, events and payments. An oracle is a third-party information source, whose sole purpose is to supply data to blockchains. So for example, if two users bet on the outcome of a soccer match, the oracle will tell the smart contract which team won, so it can pay the winning bettor.

Chainlink has made encouraging noises over the last 12 months or so with multiple partnerships that look like the product of relentless business development and go-to-market strategy, as noted by Spencer Noon, head of crypto investments at DTC Capital.

Link chart by messari

Recently, decentralized finance (DeFi) platform bZx integrated Chainlink’s solutions recently following the major hack in February. Meanwhile, Celsius Network, a crypto lending and borrowing platform, announced on Monday that it has entered into a partnership with Chainlink to strengthen the security and reliability of its services.

Losers

VET

Quarterly performance: -39 percent

Rank by market capitalization: 36

Market capitalization: $262 million

Current price: $0.0030

VeChain’s VET token fell by 39 percent in the January-March period, erasing the rise from $0.0035 to $0.0055 seen in the final quarter of 2019.

The first quarter began on a positive note, with the cryptocurrency rising 10 percent in January. The gains, however, were significantly less than the broader market, as indicated by the total market capitalization, which rose by 35 percent.

VET remained on the back foot in February, having underperformed in the first month, and took a beating in March as the broader market collapsed with the sell-off in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency hit a record low of 0.0014 on the Binance exchange on March 13 and ended the month with a 43 percent loss.

VeChain is a blockchain-enabled platform designed to enhance supply chain management processes and has a strong presence in China. The coronavirus outbreak in China in January and February and across Europe and in the U.S. in March hurt VeChain’s business activity. However, no projects were canceled due to the pandemic, according to a VeChain Foundation blog post.

The foundation announced on March 31 about a collaboration with Shanghai Gas (Group) Co., Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shenergy Group Company Limited with registered capital of 4.2 billion renminbi ($57 million), to develop a blockchain-enabled energy project.

NEO

Quarterly performance: -20 percent

Rank by market capitalization: 22

Market capitalization: $631 million

Current price: $6.63

NEO (NEO), which fell 20 percent in the first quarter, is also based in China. The sentiment around “China’s Ethereum” had turned bullish in the final three months of 2019, mainly due to President Xi Jinping’s decision to embrace blockchain technology.","The coronavirus pandemic has touched every corner of the world economy – even the seedy underbelly of internet commerce.

Customers spent fewer bitcoins at darknet markets over the last two months despite the slide in the cryptocurrency’s price, according to data from blockchain surveillance firm Chainalysis.

Darknet markets are websites that facilitate the sale of illegal goods, usually drugs, counterfeit currencies and weapons.

“Historically, darknet markets’ revenue (value of bitcoins sent to dark markets) has had a weak inverse correlation with bitcoin’s price,” according to Chainalysis. That relationship, however, has reversed over the last two months, as seen in the chart below.

Darknet markets' revenue Source: Chainalysis

Bitcoin topped out at $10,500 in mid-February and fell as low as $3,867 on March 13. As prices fell, so did the value of bitcoins sent to darknet markets from $4.1 million to $3.2 million.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

However, the value of bitcoins sent to dark markets had risen from $3.9 million to just over $5 million during the final quarter of 2019. In that same period, the cryptocurrency had declined by nearly 13 percent and hit a low of $6,400 in mid-December.

The latest change in correlation has come amid a health crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, began spreading at a faster rate in Asian countries in February and hit the European and American shores in March.

As a result, traditional markets tanked, triggering a liquidity crisis, which saw investors sell classic haven assets like gold for cash, mainly the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin, too, was treated as a source of liquidity.

Darknet vendors may have panicked due to sudden drop in prices and slowed down sales out of fear that the cryptocurrency could become worthless in a cataclysmic event. Also, darknet customers may have scaled back purchases as, during times of panic, investors tend to hold onto cash.

While the exact reason for the drop in darknet markets’ revenue is not clear, the report by Chainalysis suggests COVID-19 made it harder to sell drugs.

“Recent reports point out that Mexican drug cartels are having a harder time sourcing fentanyl, as China’s Hubei province — a hub of the global fentanyl trade — has been hit hard as the epicenter of the outbreak. Such disruptions to global supply chains could be hampering darknet market vendors’ ability to do business,” the firm said.

Merchant services and gambling providers have also seen drops in revenue over the past few weeks.

The seven-day average of the value of bitcoins sent to merchant services fell from $7 million to $4.5 million in the five weeks to the end of March. Meanwhile, the value of bitcoins sent to gambling services declined from $5 million to $3 million.

Again, the decline seen in these sectors is not surprising, as people tend to save more during recessions.","Source: Bitcoin Lessons

Bitcoin Lessons has officially launched to help educate the public about the history of money and the world of Bitcoin.

The app offers a mobile-based bite-sized learning approach similar to popular language app Duolingo. It is designed for those with an appetite for knowledge and can be used in short bursts to suit busy lives.



Linking to the wider Bitcoin community, Bitcoin Lessons features further reading sections independently recommending the best podcasts, books and articles available to help further understanding of the topic.



Since going live in early March, Bitcoin Lessons has been downloaded by users in 53 countries, offering insight into current consumer appetite to learn about the currency. Strong demand has been seen from Latin American countries which represent a high percentage of total downloads.



The top countries for downloads are currently:

1. Mexico 17%

2. Venezuela 16%

3. United States 13%

4. Spain 7%

5. Colombia 5%

- United Kingdom 5%

Venezuela’s inflation rate has skyrocketed 53 million percent since 2016 with 9 out of 10 people trapped in starvation, which could explain their curiosity for learning about Bitcoin.



The app currently contains 11 lessons - from the history of where Bitcoin came from and how it compares to previous forms of money, to the strengths and weaknesses of Bitcoin and what the future may hold, as well as how to venture into the world of Bitcoin knowledgeable and confident.



The free version of the app offers four lessons and users can also choose to pay to unlock all content and earn Bitcoin as they learn. By acting as an incentive to help people complete their learning, they are rewarded their own Bitcoin as they finish each lesson.



Gareth Stephens, Founder of Bitcoin Lessons has spent the past 13 years building products for global software companies including GBG, where he was Head of Product as it progressed beyond a $1 billion dollar valuation. He has been a Bitcoin enthusiast for many years and has worked full-time in Bitcoin for the past 18 months.



Gareth commented: “Having been a passionate advocate of Bitcoin for many years I, like many, have trawled the web-based resources available to understand how the currency works, how to get started and how to take a more sophisticated approach to holding the currency in the long-term. It’s a minefield, especially for the time-poor. With many predicting that Bitcoin heralds the future of money, it’s vital that it becomes simpler for everyone to understand why.



“We’ve been amazed by the positive reaction to Bitcoin Lessons in our first few weeks and are really encouraged to see the locations where we seem to have hit a chord. So much so, we are now intending to produce translated versions with open access to all content for those in countries that need this knowledge the most.”

The free app is available to download on both iOS and Android.



Access to all 11 lessons is currently being offered free to anyone who is home-schooling children during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Indian State Ministry Discusses Cryptocurrency Plans With Founders of Crypto Bulls Roadshow

An Indian state official recently met with the founders of the “India Crypto Bulls” initiative and discussed cryptocurrency development, investment, and innovation in India. News.Bitcoin.com talked to Kumar Gaurav, one of the founders, to find out more about the meeting.

India Crypto Bulls Founders Meet Rajasthan Official

Amin Pathan, chairman of the Dargah Committee in Ajmer, under the government of India’s Ministry of Minority Affairs, recently met with the founders of the India Crypto Bulls initiative — the team that is organizing a nationwide roadshow in 15 major Indian cities.

News.Bitcoin.com talked to one of the India Crypto Bulls founders, Cashaa CEO Kumar Gaurav, about the meeting. He explained that Pathan is “the president of the Dargah Committee, Ajmer, which is one of the biggest holy pilgrimages of Muslims all over the world. He is exploring blockchain solution to digitize various assets governed by his ministry to finish any corruption due to title unclarity.” Pathan is also chairman of the Rajasthan State Haj Committee (State Minister), former State President BJP Minority Morcha Rajasthan, and the vice president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association.

Pathan discussed his views regarding India’s crypto development, investment, and innovation. He told the India Crypto Bulls founders:

The state is looking to host a conference with participants including Indian administrative service officers who are concerned and relevant with the key affairs relating to bitcoin and other digital asset financial services.

“Moreover, the upcoming conference in the state by Rajasthan minister will also comprise of training sessions on compliance, how cryptocurrency investment can be matured, precautions that an investor has to follow before dealing or planning to invest in cryptocurrency and several other factors,” the team conveyed. “They believed India Crypto Bulls’ roadshow is closely aligned with their vision of hosting upcoming conferences.”

Gaurav Dubey, O1ex CEO and the other founder of India Crypto Bulls, was quoted as saying, “We are sure that India Crypto Bulls will be able to spread the right knowledge on Cryptocurrencies in Rajasthan with tremendous outreach, under his wise guidance.” Cashaa’s CEO further told news.Bitcoin.com:

He [Shri. Pathan] supported the nationwide Indian Crypto Bulls roadshow and will host the event in his city Jaipur, and Udaipur.

India Crypto Bulls is an initiative by Gaurav and Dubey. They had planned to launch a roadshow across about 15 cities in India in early April to prepare the country for the next crypto bull run and educate the public regarding cryptocurrencies. However, due to the current coronavirus pandemic and the directives from the Indian health ministry, the roadshow has been postponed and will be rescheduled for a later date.

Crypto Gaining Traction After Supreme Court Verdict

The cryptocurrency ecosystem in India is rebuilding after the damage done by the April 2018 circular issued by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which banned banks from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban forced several crypto businesses to shut down as a result.

After multiple delays, the Indian supreme court finally ruled that the circular was unconstitutional. The court lifted the ban on March 4. Since then, crypto exchanges have been busy bringing back INR banking support. Several global companies also plan to expand into India and invest in Indian crypto startups. Furthermore, the Indian government is reportedly planning to regulate the crypto space instead of imposing an outright ban as recommended by the interministerial committee (IMC) headed by former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg.

Commenting on his meeting with Shri. Pathan, Gaurav said: “I found Shri. Amin Pathan Ji an inspiration for youth in India and abroad who lost hope from Indian politicians. After meeting Aminji, I feel confident that under his leadership and with the backing of BJP, emerging technologies like blockchain will get the strong support of Indian govt.” Welcoming Pathan onboard the India crypto bulls roadshow, he indicated:

The meeting concluded with a futuristic talk on crypto adoption and development in India. In addition to this, the ministry invited India Crypto Bulls to Rajasthan as a way to emphasize on the crypto discussion.

Key Takeaways The Lightning Network-exclusive application, Fold, may have found a unique bisection of retail users and hardcore maximalists.

Since the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has become an overnight prepper.

Businesses like Fold have seen huge volume since users flood to sites like Amazon for last-minute purchases.

Share this article

Long before last-minute preppers were forming lines around the Costcos of America, Will Reeves of Fold has been serving preppers and penny savers a heavy dose of Bitcoin. And now, amid the pandemic, business has been good. Very good.

Building an On-Ramp for Apocalypse Money

Final Provisions took up just a portion of the Fold team’s time over the course of last year. “It was part of our ‘10% time,’ in which we explore different topics and new ideas,” said Reeves.

The site is rather pessimistic. In between different gifs featuring rioters, downed androids, and flooding subway tunnels, are links to products on Amazon. These aren’t your everyday household items, however.

Instead, viewers are shown a catalog of end-of-the-world essentials. From emergency bags of water, pet cockroaches, to a DIY houseboat building plan, there is a clear target audience in mind. The second item on the list is also a Ledger Nano S cryptocurrency wallet.

Critically, this site was built a year ago, long before countries began tracking cases of Coronavirus. “Even before the pandemic, we saw some of the cracks and stresses that the world was facing,” said Reeves. “And as a Bitcoin company that’s working within a larger community, we saw a lot of overlap with so-called ‘preppers’ and Bitcoin enthusiasts.”

The primary existential threat for most maximalists has been irresponsible monetary policy. One could argue that Bitcoin was wrought out of the carnage that was the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailouts. And after a brief tour of crypto Twitter, it’s not hard to pick up the apocalyptic sentiments.

JUST IN: US Government says that ""Your money is safe at the banks"" and ""The last thing you should be doing is pulling your money out of the banks right now"". That sure sets me at ease. ?pic.twitter.com/7pN8TwLgm2 — Vis (@Vis_in_numeris) March 24, 2020

Alongside building Final Provisions, the team has been head down constructing one of the largest onramps to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. “We decided to lean into Lightning because we saw that Bitcoin could serve a few key roles,” said Reeves. “Payments have been a big portion of our vision, and so, using Lightning Network was a clear choice.”

This vision is a shared one, too. Spun-out of the blockchain venture studio Thesis, Fold raised $2.5 million last year to continue building out the Bitcoin app. Investors included Slow Ventures, Craft Ventures, Goldcrest Capital, Fulgur Ventures, and Meltem Demirrors’ CoinShares.

Fold has followed a simple strategy for getting new users and veteran Bitcoiners to use the app.

Attracting Preppers and Penny-Savers to Bitcoin

To attract the former, the team launched a project called Lightning Pizza. It’s a guide for buying your first Bitcoin on CashApp, transferring that new BTC to the Lightning-enabled BlueWallet, and then using Fold to buy a pizza from Dominos.

For veterans, the sell is much easier.

Sending BTC on Lightning has so far been difficult to trace. When reporting on activity, BitMEX research explained that “there are a significant number of private channels” that cannot be observed. These privacy features have made Lightning Network a viable alternative for Bitcoin maximalists looking to conceal their spending activity.

Whether a user is buying their first Lightning Pizza from Dominos, or a Hazmat suit from Amazon, there are other, more practical reasons for turning to Fold.

When using the Bitcoin app to make purchases, users are eligible for cash back rewards. Compared with traditional rewards, Fold’s are highly competitive.

As fears rose surrounding the Coronavirus pandemic, Reeves said that there were “mass purchasings on Amazon” from Fold users. The list of available retailers is long, with Lowes, Cabela’s & Bass Pro Shops, and Taco Bell being the latest inductees.

And for every purchase made through the application, users can get 4% back in Bitcoin. It can even be connected to a fiat credit or debit card for BTC-based rewards too.

“Part of the issue with some Bitcoin operations is that the rewards are clunky, it’s a taxable event, and it’s just not as attractive as using a credit card,” Reeves said.

To make using Bitcoin even more attractive, Fold has recently launched its “Spin for Sats” program. Each day, users can log into the app and pick up a small amount of BTC. “We were highly influenced by the early days of faucets,” said Reeves. “The Spin for Sats move is similar. Users can go and pick up some satoshis and play around with Bitcoin.”

We created the easiest and fastest way to get bitcoin in the history of bitcoin. One by one we’re going to convert millions ? https://t.co/ZFQO2KEuAz — Fold ? (@fold_app) March 20, 2020

As for building a product at the bleeding edge of Bitcoin, it comes with its challenges. For many, the Lightning Network has yet to claim the title of the go-to payments network for crypto users.

At the time of press, there exist roughly 12,000 active Lightning nodes, an improvement since last month according to data aggregator 1ML. It remains to be seen if easy-to-use tools like Fold will draw more attention to the network.

If not, it may just be for the preppers and tech-savvy penny savers.",
2020-04-02,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose Thursday for the fourth straight session and briefly climbed above $7,000 for the first time in three weeks.

The bellwether cryptocurrency was up 2.5 percent to $6,821 as of 19:22 UTC (3:22 p.m. in New York.) Earlier, the price rallied as high as $7,236 before pulling back.

The four-day increase has helped bitcoin claw back some of its losses during the first three months of the year, when the spreading coronavirus and increasingly dire economic prospects sparked a flight for cash among investors in both traditional and digital-asset markets.

Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, a San Francisco-based hedge fund specializing in cryptocurrencies, said he saw no clear driver of Thursday’s move. Market signals show a growing conviction among bitcoin traders that prices won’t fall below $6,000 in the short term, but rallies above $7,000 appear to be drawing in sellers, he said.

“You have so many people trying to swing trade on crypto,” DiPasquale said in a phone interview.

Traditional financial markets were whipsawed again as Wall Street investors speculated that major oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia might agree on production cuts to help to stabilize prices. Oil jumped 22 percent to $24.77 a barrel, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2.3 percent.

The S&P 500 is still down 22 percent for the year to date, while bitcoin has now trimmed its 2020 losses to just 5.5 percent.

DiPasquale said many bitcoin traders are looking ahead to May’s expected “halving,” when the supply of new units of the cryptocurrency issued by the underlying blockchain network is scheduled to drop by 50 percent. The once-every-four-years-event was coded into the 11-year-old bitcoin’s original programming as a way of minimizing inflation.

The halving comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to inject an estimated $4 trillion of new liquidity into the global financial system to help stabilize markets, roughly equivalent to the total amount of money created on the central bank’s balance sheet since its founding in 1913. Investors including Mike Novogratz, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Galaxy Digital, say such moves could “debase” the value of the dollar.

“That literally is a printing press,” Novogratz told CNBC on Thursday. “I’m getting calls from real big investors we’ve never seen before, saying, `Tell me about this bitcoin.'”

Novogratz said he expects bitcoin’s price to double within the next six months and potentially climb above its previous record near $20,000 by the end of the year.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin has been forked many times.

Bitcoin Cash is the highest-profile and most contentious hard fork.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains by far the most dominant chain.

Share this article

There have been a number of Bitcoin forks over the years. But how many? The total is staggering, with over 50 forks on record.

What Is a Bitcoin Fork?

A Bitcoin fork is a cryptocurrency that split away from Bitcoin at a certain block height. Transaction histories are shared up until the time of the fork, with the new coin then splitting off onto its own blockchain.

There are two kinds of forks: soft forks and hard forks. A soft fork is backwards compatible, meaning it is a software update that is compatible with earlier versions of the blockchain. A hard fork is not backward compatible. Any blocks following a hard fork need to follow the new rules to be considered valid.

The Bitcoin network itself has undergone a number of soft forks, with software updates including preventing duplicate identification hashes and introducing lock times for individual transaction outputs.

Namecoin, created in 2011, was the first fork of the Bitcoin software. Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic (BXC) were earlier forks of the Bitcoin network reference client, released in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Most cryptocurrency projects that are well-known off-shoots of Bitcoin often followed contentious debates around the direction of the code. Bitcoin Cash was the first high-profile hard fork of Bitcoin and was created in mid-2017. It is regarded as a contentious fork, meaning it occurred because there were competing visions about the future development of the network.

A List of Bitcoin Forks

Most hard forks of Bitcoin occurred between late 2017 and early 2018. The period was remarkable because it coincided with the ICO frenzy. The rate at which new tokens were created made it difficult to keep up with the changes.

Bitcoin saw its first four hard forks on the same day of Aug. 1, 2017.

The Bitcoin Cash Fork

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) came into existence at block height 478,559. It was a divisive and contentious split, led by those who believed in increased block sizes. The new protocol increased block sizes to 8MB. Technically, Bitcoin Clashic and Bytether were created a block before it. Following at block height 498,888 on the same day, Oil BTC was created.

The Bitcoin Gold Fork

Bitcoin Gold (BTG) was the next high-profile project to fork from Bitcoin. The coin split away at block height 491,407 on Oct. 10, 2017. The aim of Bitcoin Gold was to create a new version of Bitcoin that would “democratize” mining by changing Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm.

The next month, Bitcore (BTX) and Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) were created. Bitcoin Diamond was designed to build a network more resistant to attacks and to enhance network capacity.

December 2017 Bitcoin Hard Forks

In the month of December of 2017, almost 20 new coins were created through hard forks from Bitcoin:

Bitcoin Silver (BTSI)

Bitcoin Nano (BTN)

BitcoinX (BCX)

Super Bitcoin (SBTC)

Bitcoin Hot (BTH)

UnitedBitcoin (UB)

Bitcoin World (BTW)

Bitcoin Stake (BTCS)

Lightning Bitcoin (LBTC)

Bitcoin Faith (BTF)

Bitcoin New (BTN)

Bitcoin Top (BTT)

Bitcoin File (BIFI)

Bitcoin God (GOD)

Quantum Bitcoin (QBTC)

Bitcoin SegWit2X x11 (B2X)

Bitcoin Uranium (BUM)

BitcoinBoy (BCB)

Bitcoin Ore (BCO)

Many of these late 2017 coins are no longer in circulation and some were considered a scam at the time of their creation. However, projects like Super Bitcoin remain trading on 12 active markets.

Bitcoin Forks of Early 2018

As the heat cooled on crypto markets in the beginning of 2018, forks continued. In the first few months of the 2018 bear market:

Bitcoin All (BTA)

Bitcoin Private (BTCP)

Bitcoin Pizza (BPA)

Bitcoin Rhodium (BTR)

Bitcoin Smart (BCS)

BitVote (BTV)

Bitcoin Interest (BCI)

Bitcoin Atom (BCA)

Bitcoin Lite (BTCL) were created.

Bitcoin Private was forked from ZClassic and Bitcoin. It supports zk-SNARKs, masking the details of the sender and recipient of a transaction.

This list is not exhaustive. As Bitcoin is open source code, any developer can fork it and create a new cryptocurrency. According to research from BitMEX, there were a total of 44 forks in the mid-2017 to early-2018 period. Only Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Private saw significant trading volume.

Forks of Forks

A number of Bitcoin forks have undergone another subsequent fork. The highest profile of these was Bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s Vision). BSV forked from BCH at the end of 2018, creating listings of BCHABC and BCHSV, Both sides battled in the hash wars to determine which coin would dominate.

The Bitcoin Cash split was also over the issue of block size, with the SV team favoring even larger blocks. Bitcoin SV claims to be the closest Bitcoin-named blockchain to Satoshi’s “original vision” of peer-to-peer electronic cash, or so its creators claim.

Bitcoin has forked a number of times. Sometimes it has arisen from genuine ideological or technological differences. Other times, it has been rather uncontentious, with a group of developers seeking the marketing power of the Bitcoin name.

Which Forks are Worth Claiming?

All told, there have likely been over 50 Bitcoin forks. More could still be created over time. Today, there is a total of nine Bitcoin forks that see any trading volume at all. The forks worth claiming, at current prices:

Bitcoin Cash (BCH): $219

Bitcoin SV (BSV): $166

Bitcoin Gold (BTG): $7.2

Bitcoin HD (BHD): $5.1

Bitcoin Rhodium (XRC): $4.1

Of those, only Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Diamond see significant trading volume.","Why did this happen?

Announced Thursday, Thesis will shortly debut TBTC, a trustless platform for making bitcoin-backed tBTC tokens on Ethereum. The private keys guarding the BTC are stored using Keep, the firm’s system for storing secrets in a usable fashion on the world computer. Few secrets are more useful and valuable than bitcoin private keys.

That said, a vocal cohort of bitcoin partisans has been very publicly skeptical of DeFi, but TBTC’s creator doesn’t think that represents the broader view. After all, more people hold bitcoin than ever before.

“The silent majority of most bitcoin and ETH people aren’t maximalists,” Matt Luongo told CoinDesk in a phone call.

Luongo is the CEO and founder of Thesis, a blockchain development studio. The idea for Keep arose out of building bitcoin rewards app Fold, which needed ways to store data in public, privately. While not committing to a precise timeline, Luongo said both Keep and TBTC will go live at the same time – in a matter of “weeks not months.”

The new funding round was led by Paradigm Capital, with participation from Fenbushi Capital, Collaborative Fund and others. In December 2018, Keep had a prior round that included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital and Draper Associates.

“Decentralized financial applications on Ethereum have seen clear demand,” Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam said in a statement. “Bitcoin is the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Building a bridge that allows Bitcoin to interact with DeFi makes a lot of sense, and tBTC is a credible attempt to do exactly that.”

Luongo is himself extremely long BTC, but he’s not one of those bitcoin diehards who dismisses DeFi.

“I think the whole Bitcoin-Ethereum cultural split has outlived its usefulness,” he said.

What's different about tBTC

Bitcoin is already on Ethereum, most notably with wBTC, an ERC-20 token created by BitGo.

Naturally, wBTC builds on its creator’s strengths. BitGo serves as the custodian and lets anyone check its BTC balances against outstanding wBTC. But having a centralized, identifiable custodian could potentially introduce censorship risks in the eyes of some users.

Conversely, TBTC is an application built to allow trustless storage of the bitcoin backing tBTC tokens. To mint one tBTC, a user contacts the Keep network, which designates a wallet for storing the bitcoin. The keys for that wallet are held in a multi-sig structure across several nodes on the Keep network that have staked KEEP tokens.

This is just what Keep was built for, Luongo explained. “It let’s you operate with private material and choose people to hold it randomly,” he said.

The chosen nodes collateralize the BTC with ETH at 150 percent of the value of the underlying BTC. Then the tBTC token gets minted to the bitcoin owner’s wallet.

That token can be used in DeFi apps that accept it (more on that later). Anytime they want to unlock their bitcoin, the tBTC creator simply needs to return an equal amount of tBTC to the smart contract, which will burn the tBTC and return the bitcoin to a wallet the user controls.

BTC’s DeFi advantages

Interestingly, Luongo said, ETH is likely to work better for collateral for BTC than a stablecoin, because the two cryptos tend to be fairly correlated. So if BTC price makes a big move, ETH will probably make a similar move, making it less likely for the ETH collateral to get liquidated.

There’s very little reason to have bitcoin on Ethereum if there’s nothing to do with it, though, so the product will only work well if DeFi applications adopt tBTC. In part, Luongo explained, that’s why Thesis sought a fresh round of funding.

“As TBTC is the first app on Keep we want to make sure it lands,” Luongo said.

Stani Kulechov runs Aave (formerly ETHLend), the number four application on DeFi, according to DeFi Pulse. Aave has a half-million dollars worth of wBTC on the application, which is fairly small compared to other tokens its users stake.

“I think DeFi is still alien to Bitcoin holders,” Kulechov told CoinDesk in an email.

That said, he also believes that the yields found in DeFi are attracting more and more hodlers. His company has been watching tBTC along with other projects working to get BTC onto Ethereum, such as Ren and pTokens.","The National Internet Finance Association of China (NIFA), a major Chinese financial watchdog, warned investors of rising risks in crypto investments.

While manipulation is a longstanding concern for crypto investors, NIFA’s warning is notable for also pushing back on the narrative of digital currency as a safe haven during a time of global turmoil.

NIFA, a self-regulatory organization affiliated with China’s central bank, said Thursday that foreign-based crypto exchanges have faked trading volume, according to its own data analysis. It also noted some trading platforms compared digital currencies to safe haven assets like gold and silver, but a recent tumble in the crypto market caused significant losses for investors.

“In our sampling analysis based on trading data from some of the exchanges, the daily trading turnover rate for more than 40 coins is over 100 percent, while more than 70 coins’ rate exceeds 50 percent,” NIFA said. “Despite the relatively low price and small market value, there have been massive trading volumes.”

The trading platforms have created the “false prosperity” in the crypto trading market by tempering statistics and using robots to increase trading volume. Some platforms have completely made up trading volume by copying other exchanges’ data, NIFA claimed.

The authority also accuses the trading platforms of misguiding investors by claiming virtual currencies are even safer than gold and silver to mitigate the volatility in the international financial market.

“After tricking investors into investing in crypto, some exchanges will manipulate the market through a range of trading techniques to take the investors’ assets,” NIFA said.

For example, exchanges can stop investors from trading by shutting off their systems, freezing assets or staging a system breakdown. Some investors would not be able to close a position and suffer a lot of losses, especially for those that trade with high leverage.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, but its real supply is much lower.

Coins have been erased or lost for various reasons over the years.

Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s anonymous creator, accounts for almost all BTC lost.

There can only be 19.5 million Bitcoins at max; the current real supply is 16.8 million Bitcoin.

Share this article

Bitcoin’s scarcity is a vital aspect of its value proposition. The project’s anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed the network with a capped supply just shy of 21 million BTC. But after accounting for coins that are lost forever, how many Bitcoins are actually accessible?

How to Lose Bitcoin

The theoretical limit on Bitcoin’s supply is 21 million coins. But the real supply of Bitcoin is much lower than this limit.

Unlike cash in a bank account, when the private key or seed phrase for a Bitcoin wallet is lost, those coins are gone forever. An online banking or ATM pin can be reset because the bank has ultimate control of all accounts.

Bitcoin is self-custodial. This means that if a user loses their coins, it is impossible to retrieve them. This is not the case if the coins are stored using a third-party custodian, like an exchange or other value-add service.

Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, meant for it to be designed this way. They are believed to be the earliest BTC miner, contributing massively to the total amount of lost Bitcoins.

Back in the early days of Bitcoin, before it had a price or liquid exchanges, it was an activity for hobbyists. People mined BTC on their personal computers as the difficulty was extremely low. The network was infantile, and some may have even deleted their private keys on purpose, thinking this “magic internet money” would never gain value.

Tracking Real Supply

CoinMetrics, a data firm covering the crypto space, ran the numbers to estimate the total amount of Bitcoin that has been locked away forever. To do this, the firm undertook a rigorous UTXO, or Unspent Transaction Outputs, analysis and looked at coins that have been dormant since July 2010.

Their research concluded that as of November 2019, over 1.5 million Bitcoins have been effectively burnt. In the world of crypto, the term “burnt” is another of saying that tokens are lost forever and no longer contribute to a network’s contributing supply.

Surprisingly, there were five factors that contributed to this number.

Firstly, when Satoshi mined the first Bitcoin block, the first 50 BTC mined were never included in a UTXO set. That means these coins never existed, though the transaction for mining them was real.

Second, there are two sets of identical digital signatures for four different transactions where a miner receives their block reward.

At blocks 91,722 and 91,880 the signature was the same, erasing the reward given at block 91,772 as it came first. The same incident was replicated at blocks 91,812 and 91,842. One hundred Bitcoins were erased as a result of this bug.

Third, there were two blocks at which miners didn’t claim their block reward and another where the miner didn’t claim their transaction fee reward. A total of 20.5 BTC was lost this way.

Fourth, some amount of BTC was sent to burner addresses. All but one, which was for Counterparty, were bogus addresses, burning a total of 2,214 BTC.

The final reason for lost Bitcoins is related to “zombie coins.” These are coins that haven’t been moved in nearly 10 years; they account for a majority of mined coins that are no longer a part of circulating supply. The only data point here is 1.496 million BTC that were mined by Satoshi and never touched.

In fact, none of Satoshi’s addresses have ever shown any transaction activity.

How Many Bitcoins Are There?

Since 1.5 million Bitcoins are almost guaranteed to be lost, we can estimate today’s real supply with some degree of accuracy.

In total, a maximum of 19.5 million Bitcoins can ever exist, despite claims of a total cap of 21 million.

CoinGecko data shows that 18.294 Bitcoins have been mined so far. So the number of Bitcoins that exist today is just shy of 16.8 million.

There are some other factors that come into play. For starters, we cannot accurately predict how many thousands, or millions, of Bitcoins have been lost in the last decade.

Further, Bitcoins stolen from exchanges like Mt. Gox and Bitfinex have hardly been moved. The proprietors of the PlusToken Ponzi scheme are the exception, offloading chunks of their loot on Huobi.

This estimation doesn’t offer a precise count for how many coins lost, but it helps establish the lower limit of total coins lost, as well as the upper limit for total supply.","Credit: CC0 Public Domain

Cryptocurrencies have been treated as a financial terra incognita—they have enjoyed growing interest but also raised concerns due to their virtuality. The use of statistical methods utilizing correlation matrices to analyze the hundred most-traded virtual currencies shows that the cryptocurrency market in the last two years is less and less different from the mature global currency market (Forex) and becomes independent of it. It means cryptocurrencies can be considered a serious and full-fledged financial instrument.

The concept of cryptocurrency has settled in general public for some time. This financial instrument has both enthusiastic supporters and implacable opponents. What does this term mean? Simply put, a cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual means of payment that exists only in a computer system and therefore has no physical equivalents in the form of banknotes or coins. More technically, it is a type of decentralized register consisting of independent devices, based on blockchain technology, using cryptographic solutions and storing assets information in contractual units. All transactions carried out in the world of cryptocurrencies are anonymous, but each of them is publicly available.

Cryptocurrencies have emerged relatively recently. The first of them—Bitcoin—was proposed in 2008 by a person or group of people nicknamed Satoshi Nakamoto. This event coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis. According to its creators, the Bitcoin was supposed to provide a tool for transactions via the Internet without the participation of a monetary authority—the central bank in the case of standard currency. The first transaction using bitcoins—the purchase of 2 pizzas for a nowadays staggering amount of 10,000 bitcoins—was made in 2010. In the same year, the first Bitcoin exchange market started its operation. Since then, there has been a spectacular development of the cryptocurrency market up to a level reaching a peak capitalization of 800 billion USD. Currently, about 5200 virtual currencies, in particular Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), are traded on various exchange markets.

The cryptocurrency market is unique in terms of research capabilities due to its spectacular development in a reasonably short period and almost unlimited data availability. This allows statistical analyses to be carried out at various stages of development and to track its evolution and trends. These studies are conducted by a team of scientists led by Professor Stanislaw Drozdz from the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Krakow and the Cracow University of Technology. The group decided to tackle the problem of the existence of dependencies and their evolution within a basket of 100 virtual currencies representing about 95% of the capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency market, taking into account 1278 days from 1 October 2015 to 31 March 2019.

In their studies, based on previous analyses, researchers used correlation matrix formalism derived from statistical physics. In general, calculations with such matrices make it possible to determine if a particular pattern exists in the data set. An example of a perfect two-dimensional correlation is a straight line, and the complete lack of it is symbolized by points scattered randomly on the plane. The determinant of the correlation matrix is a measure of collinearity, i.e. the compliance of variables representing the system. The closer it is to 1, the lower the degree of interdependence of these variables, while the closer to 0, the more significant the correlation. The research focused on the distribution of matrix elements and deviations of the distribution of eigenvalues of the correlation matrix from the so-called Wishart model distribution for random matrices, which corresponds to the situation of a complete lack of correlations.

It turned out that the value of the main eigenvalue, which indicates the degree of correlation, significantly depends on the choice of the base currency—says the co-author of the article Marcin Watorek. In general, the base currency is the more important concerning the market value, the smaller the eigenvalue (which, however, must be higher than the values generated for a random background). This is a very important result for assessing the role of a specific cryptocurrency on the global market of these financial instruments.

Researchers conducted analyses comparing the characteristics of the exchange rate fluctuations of cryptocurrencies in relation to each other, to the USD exchange rate and the so-called fictitious currency, artificially generated from a random distribution, introduced as a reference for research purposes. The results obtained for the cryptocurrency market are similar to the corresponding measurements from the stock and traditional currency market—for example, the Forex market. This similarity applies both to the variability dynamics of applicable exchange rates and the fact that the dominant feature of this dynamics is behaviour indistinguishable from chaos. In the initial phase of the analyzed period, it was the USD and Bitcoin that played the role of the main base currencies for cryptocurrency trading. While approaching today, one can observe gradual independence of the virtual currency market from USD. Currently, only Bitcoin is the natural base currency for other cryptocurrencies.

Furthermore, starting from mid-2017, the correlation patterns of exchange rate fluctuations of cryptocurrencies expressed in USD are beginning to imitate more clearly the models generated in a situation when these rates are shown in a fictitious currency whose variability is entirely random, and therefore independent of the cryptocurrency market. At the same time, historically the first and strongest cryptocurrency—Bitcoin and also Ethereum, turn out to be, among virtual currencies, the USD and EUR equivalents of the Forex market. These results indicate that cryptocurrencies are becoming a fully mature, integral, self-contained and independent of the Forex market, and therefore an alternative to it. It seems that we are just witnessing the finalization of the transformation from paper to digital civilization.

Our research on internal correlations on the cryptocurrency market indicates that this market has reached the level of maturity allowing it to be treated as equivalent to regular financial markets, and in particular the global currency exchange market, which is Forex—explains Stanislaw Drozdz. We witness the emergence of an integrated and independent market in which cryptocurrencies are exchanged with each other without the need to use, for example, the USD, as was the case in the initial phase of cryptocurrency trading.

The work of the Krakow team has shown that despite existing economic connections, cryptocurrencies cease to be significantly correlated with traditional financial instruments such as currencies, stock markets or commodities. Apart from being a new medium of brokerage in trade—an alternative to traditional currencies—they create new possibilities for diversifying investment portfolios. The described analyses certainly have the potential to reduce the degree of distrust of investors towards this visionary and futuristic financial instrument.

Last month’s crash in cryptocurrency prices has prompted manufacturers to sell inventories at a discount, in some cases as steep as 20 percent, over the past few weeks. Both the newest models and slightly older machines have been marked down.

Complicating the matter is the imminent bitcoin (BTC) halving in May that will reduce the network’s mining reward by half, causing most miners to be less profitable if bitcoin’s price doesn’t increase significantly by then.

For instance, DJ Miner, an overseas distributor for Shenzhen, China-based MicroBT, was advertising about $2,500 per unit of the manufacturer’s flagship WhatsMiner M30S early last month. After bitcoin’s March 12 crash – the worst sell-off in seven years – the price is now cut by 20 percent to $2,000 per unit.

The WhatsMiner M20S, a less advanced but popular model that boosted MicroBT’s market share against major rival Bitmain in 2019, is also seeing a 20 percent price cut from $1,679 to now $1,340, DJ Miner’s website shows. Pangolinminers, another distributor for MicroBT shows similar pricing rollbacks on its website.

Similarly, while Bitmain is advertising $1,567 for its AntMiner S17+ with a computing power of 67 terahashes per second, various resellers are posting quotes on WeChat seen by CoinDesk at around $1,300 per unit.

The Beijing-based mining giant has previously announced the pricing for its latest flagship AntMiner S19 Pro at about $2,900 per unit but the shipment won’t take place until May and so far is only available for investors inside China.

Efficient market

It is important to note that most specialized bitcoin computers, known as ASICs, had already been dropping in price since the fourth quarter of last year, as the manufacturers adjusted their strategies in line with bitcoin’s price swing.

These machines are priced assuming it would take the buyer on average 15 months to make back their equipment investment. Holding the payback period relatively constant, manufacturers would adjust the prices of their equipment according to bitcoin’s market price and the level of competition on the network – the two factors that determine how much revenue a miner can generate in a day.

Miner pricing data compiled by research startup TokenInsight shows that, for example, the Whatsminer M20S and the AntMiner S17 Pro were priced at around $2,400 and $3,000, respectively, in mid-October 2019. The price for both had dropped to around $1,500 as of March 10.

“ASIC miners have experienced a relatively large market devaluation since Q4 2019. However, the miner market has found some level of price floor during Q1 2020 despite the recent crypto market downturn,” said TokenInsight analyst Johnson Xu. “Some experienced miners are currently looking to purchase some secondhand ASICs at a significant discount … based on their carefully structured model.”

Blockware Solutions, a reseller of bitcoin ASIC miners in North America that also operates mining facilities, said in a recent research report that the market crash in March, together with the coming halving, has led to a significant decrease of bitcoin’s mining computing power – which in the long run, could be an encouraging sign for the market’s efficiency.

“If bitcoin remains at lower price levels for two to four months, post-halving, many miners operating at a loss will be forced to shut off,” Blockware said. “After all the miners that are operating at a loss shut off, the miners that survive experience significant margin relief. We will witness a network in short-term chaos, but difficulty adjustments will reinstate stability once the inefficient miners shut off.”

The firm believes after the Bitcoin network experiences sustained favorable competition adjustments, the “likelihood of a bottom in bitcoin’s price is enhanced.”","A survey released on April 2 and conducted by peer-to-peer Bitcoin (BTC) marketplace Paxful revealed growing positive sentiment in terms of cryptocurrency adoption in India.

Paxful's survey of investors between the ages of 18–55 revealed that 75% of them had invested in cryptocurrencies.

Prior to the Reserve Bank of India's crypto ban lifting, Paxful said that trade volume in the P2P marketplace in January exceeded $3 million, taking into account that 93.8% of respondents invested in cryptos before the ban.

According to the study, 78.5% of respondents prefer to use cryptocurrencies to transfer money quickly and easily, since they believe that the traditional banking system is corrupt, while 64.8% believe that it is a way to achieve financial freedom.

Growing cryptocurrency adoption in India

Speaking with Cointelegraph, Paxful’s CEO Ray Youssef said that, now that crypto business can receive banking series in the country, the cryptocurrency space will see significant growth:

“Momentum will rise either way. Even when the cryptocurrency banking ban was in place, the Indian crypto community was actively trading and investing. It is good that they are heavily calling on regulation, with the barriers lifted, the momentum has multiplied manifold with million-dollar investments and support.”

Youseff also explained that the growing mobile technology revolution in India has caused an older segment of the population to know and learn about the cryptocurrency market.

Future is bright for the Indian market

The report ensures that the future of cryptocurrencies in India looks “bright,” as 43.50% of respondents look forward to an increase in jobs and the ability to take on entrepreneurial endeavors thanks to the crypto market. Youssef commented on the growing trend shown by the survey:"
2020-04-03,"Trading activity for bitcoin (BTC) futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has picked up pace as bitcoin has extended its recent rally to levels above $7,200.

CME traded $347 million worth of futures contracts Thursday – the highest since March 16. On that day, futures witnessed a trading volume of $414 million, according to data provided by research firm Skew.

Thursday’s spike in trading volumes marked a 294

percent rise from the preceding day’s tally of $88 million.

Open interest or open positions on futures ticked higher to $170 million on Thursday to hit the highest level since March 11. While open interest denotes the number of contracts that are open or active, volumes represent the number of contracts traded during a specific period.

Institutional interest in the derivatives space, which began heating up in the fourth quarter of 2019, surged in the first six weeks of this year. For instance, daily trading volume for bitcoin futures on CME rose from $176 million on Jan. 2 to a record high of $1.1 billion on Feb. 18.

By March 6, however, volumes had dropped to $88

million. Open interest also declined from the record high of $338 million to

$113 million in the five weeks to March 20.

Other exchanges also saw a similar drop in the

activity. The aggregate or total open interest in futures listed across the

globe fell below $2 billion in March, having hit highs above $5 billion in

mid-February, according to Skew data.

The sudden slowdown in the activity coincided with the global dash for fiat, primarily U.S. dollars, triggered by the coronavirus-led slide in the global equity markets. Institutions likely took a break from the crypto derivatives market amid the crisis.

As CME is again witnessing higher numbers, activity on other exchanges, too, is picking up, as evidenced by the rise in aggregate daily volumes to $19 billion, the highest since March 23.

Rally return

The volume numbers have improved alongside a recovery in bitcoin’s price. The top cryptocurrency by market value rose above $7,200 on Thursday – a level last seen on March 12, when bitcoin’s price had collapsed by nearly 40 percent, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

At press time, bitcoin is trading near $6,950, representing a 2.4 percent gain on the day.

From a fundamental perspective, the rally from lows under $4,000 seen in March could continue as on-chain metrics have recently bounced out of, or are currently sitting in, zones that have historically signaled bottoms, blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode noted in its weekly newsletter.

Technical charts, too, are biased bullish.

Daily chart

Bitcoin closed above the upper edge of a pennant pattern Thursday, signaling a continuation of the rally and opening the doors for $8,000 – a level last seen on March 12.

The cryptocurrency bounced up from the upper end of the pennant (former hurdle-turned-support) early Friday, reinforcing the breakout. As a result, bitcoin may soon test the resistance of Thursday’s high near $7,200.

However, if buyers fail to keep prices above $7,000 for the second day in a row, a pullback to $6,200 could be seen. The cryptocurrency has already failed three times in the last two weeks to establish a foothold above $7,000.","Top crypto exchange Binance has hinted that it plans to launch Bitcoin (BTC) options trading.

Two tweets — via the exchange’s official handle and CEO Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”) — posted on April 3 revealed “testflight leaks” and a screenshot of an apparent prototype for trading BTC/Tether (USDT) options contracts:

“Notice anything new”?

Binance’s performative social media “leak” revealed options trading support as one of the items on a “what to test” list, which included other products that have previously been officially announced, such as the Binance Card issued by Visa.

As a popular derivative that enables traders to hedge against asset price swings in either direction, an options contract offers the chance to purchase either a right to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) a given asset at a specified “strike price.” This strike price is determined on or before the contract’s expiration date.

In response to a request from Cointelegraph, a spokesperson from Binance declined to comment.

Bitcoin options rolling out in 2019–2020

In October 2019, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group said it was expecting to see high demand in Asia for its own forthcoming options product for Bitcoin futures, first announced in September.

In December, Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx launched Bitcoin options trading for a select group of traders ahead of public launch in January 2020.","Nationwide Lockdown: Indian Cryptocurrency Exchanges See Signups and Trade Volumes Increase

India is currently under a nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak. News.Bitcoin.com talked to executives of local cryptocurrency exchanges to find out the impact of the lockdown on cryptocurrency trading. They revealed that more people are actually trading cryptocurrencies on their platforms since the lockdown began.

More People Trading Cryptos Since the Lockdown

The Indian crypto community has been rebuilding ever since the supreme court lifted the RBI ban. Then, in response to the covid-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on March 25 a 21-day nationwide lockdown — the period which ends on April 14.

Nischal Shetty, CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx, shared with news.Bitcoin.com about the impact of the lockdown on cryptocurrency trading on his platform. He said, “we’ve seen a spike in the number of people trading on Wazirx ever since the lockdown,” adding:

Signups have increased greatly since the banking restriction was lifted but a further 25% increase in signups since the lockdown.

Another Indian crypto exchange, Coindcx, is seeing a similar trend. CEO Sumit Gupta shared with news.Bitcoin.com that his exchange witnessed 10 times growth in the first week after the supreme court lifted the RBI ban. As for the effect of the nationwide lockdown, he said: “Post the lockdown situation, we are witnessing the continuation of signup growth and the rate of growth is consistent on a daily basis.” Gupta continued to share that “the number of daily trading volumes and user activity (crypto and INR) deposits on the Coindcx platform are also consistent with respect to before lockdown,” asserting:

This shows that crypto is still largely uncorrelated compared to traditional asset classes which are significantly affected due to these crises.

During the supreme court hearing against the banking restriction imposed by the central bank, it was reiterated that cryptocurrency is not illegal in India. Moreover, the Indian government is said to be discussing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in India with the central bank instead of an outright ban.

Attracting New Crypto Investors

Since the supreme court ruled in favor of cryptocurrency against the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a growing number of Indians have become interested in cryptocurrency trading. Referring to the nationwide lockdown, Shetty opined:

Since people have more time on hand, they’re spending time researching online and coming across crypto-related articles. That leads them to finally on Wazirx in order to buy their first crypto.

Just before the nationwide lockdown announcement, Wazirx and global cryptocurrency exchange Binance launched a $50 million blockchain fund that aims to invest in startups and projects in the Indian crypto ecosystem. Binance acquired Wazirx in November last year and recently announced its acquisition of Coinmarketcap. Meanwhile, Coindcx scored funding from several major venture capitalists, including Bain Capital, Polychain Capital, and Bitmex owner HDR Global Trading.

Maybe you have been caught up in the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency and have treated the digital coin like a massive investment opportunity? Or, maybe you have heard about the wonders of Bitcoin but are still struggling to fully understand what it is, and why it is so important. Today, you are in luck.

For those of you interested in Bitcoin and have flirted with the idea of using or investing in the cryptocurrency, we are going to break down everything you need to know about the revolutionary digital currency so that you can make your decision.

Since the cryptocurrency’s unprecedented run in 2017 peaking at nearly $20,000 per coin, Bitcoin has been highly debated among financial experts, researchers, economists, and entrepreneurs. Since then the cryptocurrency has floated around $5,000- $10,000 per coin, with investors eagerly waiting for the crypto to make another run again with some arguing the cryptocurrency could eventually reach as high as $100,000 per coin or even more. However, the value of Bitcoin goes far beyond just monetary. Bitcoin is changing the way we conduct transactions across the world.

As stated by Pieter Wuille, “Bitcoin enables certain uses that are very unique. I think it offers possibilities that no other currency allows. For example the ability to spend a coin that only occurs when two separate parties agree to spend the coin; with a third party that couldn’t run away with the coin itself.” However, we are getting ahead of yourself. Let’s look at the basics of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency

You have definitely heard the term cryptocurrency thrown around in conversation, but what exactly is a cryptocurrency? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, one of the first and obviously the most notable. In short, a cryptocurrency can be described as what others may call a digital or virtual currency that is secured via the process of cryptography, making the currency impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. One of the most important, and for some the most exciting, features of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is the fact that it is not controlled by or even issued by a central authority.

Decentralized networks like these are based on blockchain technology, something we will discuss later, making a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin immune to any government interference or manipulation. There are many other cryptocurrencies out there, that include but are not limited to, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Tether. Yet, some have gone on to call Bitcoin the father of all cryptocurrencies.

We do not really know who created Bitcoin

The inventor of Bitcoin is a mystery. All that we do know is that the person or persons who created Bitcoin in 2009 goes by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Originally proposed by Nakamoto in 2008, the idea behind the cryptocurrency was to create a payment system based on mathematical proof. As described by Coindesk, “...the idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way”.

Though there have been claims that Satoshi Nakamoto has been found, to this day no one really knows who Satoshi Nakamoto really is or where he might be from. Nevertheless, it is believed Satoshi Nakamoto is very wealthy as some believe that he has mined as much as 1,000,000 Bitcoins.

The first Bitcoin purchase was used to get some pizza

In fact, May 22 is celebrated as the official Bitcoin Pizza Day. Now, in the early days, Bitcoin was not worth much. In May of 2010, about 10,000 BTC was worth about $41.On the 22nd of May, 10 years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz used those 10,000 BTC to buy two Papa Johns Pizzas. Currently, at the moment, 10,000 Bitcoin is worth about $52 million. Nowadays, you can use Bitcoin in more places around the world, to buy cups of coffee, to book hotels, eat at restaurants, etc. Places like Overstock.com, Expedia.com, and Dish all accept Bitcoin. Take a look around your local area, there might be a place that accepts Bitcoin.

There is a limited supply of Bitcoin

Traditional fiat currencies like euros, dollars, or pounds have an unlimited supply meaning central banks around the world can issue as many as they want, with each currency interplaying off each other’s value in this increasingly globalized world. However, Bitcoin is very different.

Now a small fraction of Bitcoin can enter the market at any given moment, but the overall supply of the crypto will top out at 21 million. In short, the supply of Bitcoin is controlled by its complex algorithm. For those investors out there, this makes Bitcoin a very appealing asset as economic theory dictates that if demand grows and supply stays the same the overall value will increase over time. Some suspect that the final Bitcoin will be mined around the year 2140. Currently there are about 16.7 million Bitcoin units in circulation.

There are specific properties of Bitcoin that make it extremely appealing.

First and foremost, Bitcoin is fast, meaning if you need to complete a transaction across borders the entire process can take minutes compared to days or maybe weeks using traditional fiat currency. This makes the crypto extremely appealing, almost revolutionary in most cases. Secondly, Bitcoin is a secure means of conducting transactions. Cryptocurrency funds are locked in a public key cryptography system.

This cryptography system protects your Bitcoins. Next, another one of the major appeals of Bitcoin is the fact that your transactions or account are not connected to your identity. There are ways to track and analyze the flow of Bitcoin transactions, but it is almost impossible to figure out who conducted the transaction. Finally, Bitcoin transactions can not be reversed by anybody, person, entity, bank, or government. Once a Bitcoin transaction is completed, it's final. This prevents the Bitcoin network from being messed with.

Cryptocurrencies What Do Bitcoin and Tulip Mania Have in Common?

One of the more interesting inventions to come out of Bitcoin is the blockchain or what is also known as distributed ledger technology. As defined by Blockgeeks, “a blockchain is a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain)”.

A blockchain network is not owned by a central authority and the ledger cannot be tampered with. Anyone and everyone can see the transactions on the digital ledger. Think of it as a public library of transactions. Blockchain technology does not stop at Bitcoin and can be used in multiple industries.

Bitcoins are mined, but it is not as easy as you think

The process of earning bitcoin in exchange for running the verification process to validate bitcoin transactions is called Bitcoin Mining. Compared to when Bitcoin first entered the market, it is not that easy to mine a single Bitcoin, due to the number of miners in the market. The mining process requires computing rigs that use very expensive hardware. In most cases, it is better for you to go to a Bitcoin exchange and purchase a Bitcoin, rather than mining. Even more so, the computing power needed to mine cryptos is not the best thing for the environment.

As mentioned in an article in Entrepreneur, Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than 159 countries, including Ireland and most countries in Africa. If you are looking to start mining, we recommend looking at other methods of acquiring the crypto as recent data points to Bitcoin mining as being unprofitable.

Bitcoin is hotly debated

Bitcoin is hotly debated by financial experts, CEOs, entrepreneurs, government officials, and leaders. Here are what some of them think about Bitcoin.

Pro Bitcoin

“I do believe Bitcoin is going to be digital gold. That means it’s the only one of the coins out there that gets to be a legal pyramid scheme. Just like gold is. ... We have a business that we think can break even next year, if not make money. We’re not nervous; we’re frustrated that our investors have lost money. We’ve got plenty of cash to run the business for a long time.” - Mike Novogratz - Chairman, CEO and founder, Galaxy Digital Holdings, a cryptocurrency merchant bank; and former macro manager, Fortress Investment Group

“We need better cross-border payments ... because it’s good for development, it’s good for financial inclusion. “So Bitcoin can help us, it can pay us a service by forcing us to upgrade our systems. That’s a positive lesson.” The international community still needs to understand and “control these gateways between the shadow-currency universe and the regular financial system.” - Benoit Coeure - European Central Bank Executive Board member

“When bitcoin currency is converted from currency into cash, that interface has to remain under some regulatory safeguards. I think the fact that within the bitcoin universe an algorithm replaces the functions of [the government] … is actually pretty cool.” - Al Gore - American politician and environmentalist.

“We have seen historical instances where such a rush into certain investments has benefited our economy and those investors who backed the right ventures,” he said in testimony before the Senate banking committee. “But when our laws are not followed, the risks to all investors are high and numerous –- including risks caused by or related to poor, incorrect or non-existent disclosure, volatility, manipulation, fraud, and theft.” - Jay Clayton - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman

Against Bitcoin

“The main feature of cryptocurrencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The Government's ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way.” - Bill Gates, Microsoft Co-Founder

“Bitcoin is an interesting idea, but I think their mechanism for regulating the currency supply is fundamentally flawed. Because the Bitcoin supply doesn't increase in proportion to the growth or use of Bitcoins, there is a deflationary effect, creating an incentive for people to hoard Bitcoins rather than spend them. Gresham's Law in economics suggests that for a complementary currency to be successful, it needs to have an inflationary effect that exceeds inflation in the national currency.” - Robert Lons, Co-founder of BitcoinWebHosting.net

“Blockchain technology could change our world more than people imagine. Bitcoin, however, could be a bubble.” - Jack Ma, Alibaba Group Holding Founder and Chairman

“Communication volumes associated with processing transactions “could bring the internet to a halt ... The quest for decentralized trust has quickly become an environmental disaster” because of the electricity requirements, and “a cryptocurrency can simply stop functioning, resulting in a complete loss of value.” - Bank for International Settlements.

Bitcoin’s Future

At the moment, 1 Bitcoin is approximately $6,000 falling dozens of percentage points in the wake of a very hectic past couple of weeks due to the coronavirus and turbulent markets. Bitcoin is still very young, making it a polarizing topic for inventors and for everyday people. Even more, so countless hacks and illicit activity surrounding Bitcoin has called the crypto into question. Nevertheless, the general ideas behind Bitcoin make it revolutionary with some of its alternatives improving on its formula. For the average investor or curious speculator, the chance of missing out on “getting rich” off the next Bitcoin run is unbearable.

What do you think? Will Bitcoin have a long future? Or, will a better alternative take over in the coming years? Leave your answers below in the comments.","Cryptocurrency prices have always been roller coasters, and some rides are scarier than others. However, there may not be much difference in price volatility between the top two coins in the coming months, a key metric indicates.

The spread between the three-month at-the-money implied volatility for ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC), a measure of expected relative volatility between the two, declined to 8.9 percent Friday, according to the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. It was the lowest level since Dec. 5.

Implied volatility is the market’s expectation of how risky or volatile an asset would be over a specific period. It is computed using the prices of an option and the underlying asset and other inputs such as time to expiration.

The compression of this spread implies that cryptocurrencies’ fortunes are tied more strongly than before to each other. But the force driving them together could be the turmoil in the mainstream financial markets, due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

“The market is macro-driven and does not expect a lot of ‘dispersion’ between the different coins and anticipates a convergence of ether and bitcoin price volatility,” said Emmanuel Goh, CEO of Skew.

Volatility essentially represents uncertainty and has a positive impact on option prices. The higher the uncertainty, the stronger the hedging demand is for both call (bullish bet) and put (bearish bet) options.

However, it does not tell us anything about the direction of the next move. High implied volatility simply means the underlying asset has the potential for big price swings in either direction.

Ether-bitcoin volatility spread Source: Skew

The ether-bitcoin implied volatility differential topped out at a record high of 33 percent on Feb. 22 and has been falling ever since.

“Option-implied volatilities are driven by the net buying pressure for options and historical volatility,” said Lukk Strijers, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Deribit.

Trading places

Ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies were outperforming bitcoin in February. Bitcoin’s dominance rate, or share of total market capitalization, had declined to a seven-month low of 62.58 percent on Feb. 24.

Hence, it’s no surprise that, in February, markets were anticipating a higher ether price volatility compared to bitcoin.

“The increase in investor interest in ether led to a rise in ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread,” Strijers said.

The situation changed in March, as macro factors became the focal point, diverting attention from altcoins to bitcoin – a safe haven from global turbulence, at least according to its proponents, and a benchmark for crypto markets.

However, instead of rising, bitcoin fell sharply in tandem with stocks, as the demand for cash, mainly U.S. dollars, surged amid the coronavirus-led uncertainty in the financial markets.

The bellwether cryptocurrency tanked by nearly 40 percent on March 13.

“The massive drop resulted in a relatively larger increase in bitcoin’s implied volatility versus ether’s implied volatility, causing the spread to narrow,” Strijers told CoinDesk.

In this way, the ether-bitcoin implied volatility differential’s drop to multi-month lows is indicative of a macro-driven market.

Another reason bitcoin faces heightened volatility over the next three months, as suggested by the ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread, is the cryptocurrency’s next mining reward halving, expected in May.

A lot has been said about the potential impact on bitcoin’s price of the upcoming 50 percent emission cut. Most experts are of the opinion that the drop in the pace of supply expansion will bode well for the price. As a result, investor interest in bitcoin is likely to remain high compared to ether.","The National Internet Finance Association of China (NIFA), a self-regulatory organization set up by the People’s Bank of China, has said that overseas crypto exchanges fake trading volumes.

According to its own analysis published Thursday, NIFA said foreign-based crypto exchanges use “robot programs to brush and tamper with data to create the illusion of ‘prosperity’ in the virtual currency trading market.”

“In our sampling analysis based on trading data from some of the exchanges, the daily trading turnover rate for more than 40 coins is over 100%, while more than 70 coins’ rate exceeds 50%. Despite the relatively low price and small market value, there have been massive trading volumes,” said NIFA.



Crypto market manipulation has been a longstanding concern. Last year, Bitwise said roughly 95% of reported trading volume in bitcoin is fake. The Block conducted its own research on the subject at the time and found that about 86% of reported crypto trading volume is likely fake.

NIFA further said that crypto exchanges use “various gimmicks” to gain consumer attention. For instance, some platforms have begun to “hype” the concept of “virtual currency is a safe-haven asset beyond gold and silver,” but that’s not true, according to NIFA.

Indeed, The Block conducted research last week and found that bitcoin, so far in this bear market, has significantly underperformed gold.

Notably, NIFA also said that operating entities of crypto exchanges are “relatively hidden.” Their office and business development areas are often different, and consumers are unable to determine the identity of these operators, according to the watchdog.

Due to these concerns, the watchdog has advised consumers to not engage in crypto trading activities.

Crypto exchanges are effectively banned in China since 2017, but as long as their servers are outside China and transactions are conducted peer-to-peer (P2P), they can do business in the country.

Binance, for instance, offers P2P trading for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) against the Chinese yuan (CNY) since last October.","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former Texas pastor and his wife for allegedly defrauding hundreds of investors through an alkaline water-backed cryptocurrency, TeshuaCoin.

Larry Donnell and Shuwana Leonard were charged Friday with defrauding investors by allegedly stealing nearly $500,000 in the sale of bogus stock certificates and shilling an alkaline water-backed cryptocurrency and a non-existent bitcoin mining operation.

The Leonards are accused of specifically targeting the African-American community in this alleged scheme. Their companies, Teshua Business Group and Teshuater, are also named as defendants.

The Leonards allegedly attempted to sell phony stock in their alkaline water bottle company, Teshuater, which they said would yield “short-term investment returns of up to 3,000 percent” according to the complaint. This raised $291,044.07.

Larry Leonard is also accused of shilling Teshuater’s “fully functioning cryptocurrency,” TeshuaCoin.

The complaint says he compared TeshuaCoin’s usability to bitcoin (BTC) and touted its “unique” attribute – it was backed by Teshuater’s bottled alkaline water. The SEC alleges TeshuaCoin was not actually backed by Teshuater. Leonard allegedly raised $170,395.20 out of his target $20 million through this scheme.

Leonard allegedly stole an additional $25,544.96 from investors in Teshuater’s non-existent bitcoin mine. The SEC said he failed to disclose the speculative nature of bitcoin mining and never actually invested the stolen funds in the mine.","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) used bitcoin wallet activity and an old exchange account as key evidence to arrest a Russian rapper on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering.

In an affidavit unsealed earlier this week, FBI special agent Samantha Shelnick said she and her team had used the digital paper trail to uncover a major money-laundering operation, run by a shadowy criminal organization known as QQAAZZ. The rapper, Maksim Boiko, is believed to be closely connected to the leaders of the gang.

QQAAZZ received and laundered money for cybercriminals by changing fiat currency into crypto. The group had signed up for multiple exchanges, including Coinbase and Bitstamp, with the username “Atrofi95.” As these exchanges have KYC (know your customer) checks, FBI officials linked the accounts back to an email account controlled by an Aleksejs Trofimovics who, as the affidavit claims, regularly communicated with phone numbers associated with Boiko.

Boiko’s phones, used to communicate with Trofimovics, included multiple screenshots of bitcoin wallet addresses and transactions of up to $35,000. On further investigation, many of these pictures were found in conversations between Boiko and other suspected QQAAZZ members.

Suspicions were first raised for officials after Boiko and his wife tried to enter the U.S. with getting on for $20,000 in cash in January of this year. There were also multiple pictures on his phone, stretching back to 2015, showing him posing with large bundles of money. At the time, Boiko said the money came from revenue collected from rental properties in Russia, as well as investments he had made in bitcoin.

Per the FBI complaint, filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania, Shelnick said the agency also found multiple conversations between suspected cybercriminals and someone by the name of “gangass.”

They linked this pseudonym to Boiko via an account on BTC-e, a crypto exchange shut down in 2017 on suspicion that it was used to facilitate money laundering. Boiko had registered with an email containing his rap name, “Plinofficial,” and the moniker “gangass” as the username.

Boiko, who now stands accused of conspiracy to commit money laundering, has continued to release music under the label Smells Weed Music. He was still active on Twitter earlier this week. On Monday he said: “In Miami, zombie land is real. Everything is closed altogether.”

If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years imprisonment.","Source: Adobe/mino21

USD 5.5bn fintech Revolut has decided to open crypto trading feature to their ""standard"" customers earlier than planned, thus helping crypto adoption and securing another revenue stream during the global financial and economic turmoil, triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The crypto trading feature is not new for Revolut, but it was previously available only for its Premium and Metal customers.

The company, that employs 2,000 people, claims it has more than 10 million customers, mostly in Europe. Revolut does not disclose how many Premium and Metal users they have, but starting this May they'll enjoy the crypto trading feature for a smaller fee than Standard users - they'll pay 67% more.

Though it was planned for later in the year, Revolut reacted now to the ongoing pandemic, to the global economic crisis, and a number of potentially controversial tools many governments decided on using to try to mitigate the effects - including the quantitative easing program, which prompted hyperinflation fears. The company said in a letter to users that it decided to enable regular clients trading in crypto as well, thus giving them ""the opportunity to explore different ways of diversifying, including through crypto.""

Revolut supports five cryptoassets: Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP. Clients can use any fiat currency Revolut supports to buy crypto, and they can change back into fiat, all through the Exchange section within the app.

Revolut rate is derived from the partner crypto exchange, in this case Bitstamp, plus a 1.5% markup, to account for volatility, they write, adding that there are no additional fees for using the service. But the letter adds that the flat fee for Standard users will increase to 2.5% in May.

However, the company does not allow its users to transfer cryptoassets outside of the Revolut platform e.g. to an external wallet, as it ""holds cryptocurrencies on behalf of those wishing to gain exposure."" According to the company, it ""securely holds the private keys of all users in a pooled cryptocurrency wallet.""

This is also not a new grievance as many have been expressing it online for a couple of years now, claiming that those buying crypto through Revolut don't have any crypto as they don't have an address or a key, others saying that Revolut has no proof that they're actually buying or holding crypto on a user's behalf, and some even claimed that they lost thousands of dollars once Revolut decided to suspend their accounts.

Finally, Standard users will also gain access to Revolut's gold feature later this month, with a flat fee of 1.50% per trade, while Premium and Metal users keep their much lower flat fee of 0.25% per trade.

In February, the company announced it raised USD 500 million in a Series D round, valuing the company at USD 5.5 billion. It raised USD 836 million in total. Revolut claims that the total number of users has grown by 169% in 2019, while daily active customers grew by 380% last year."
2020-04-04,"There’s no doubt that Ethereum is an integral piece of the crypto market, with the massive amount of Dapps and platforms being built upon its blockchain accounting for important infrastructure within the industry.

Ethereum’s importance has only increased in recent times alongside the growing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) trend that has swept through the industry, attracting billions of dollars from investors and users.

Now, one analyst is noting that he believes Ethereum has become Bitcoin’s backbone, with its immense value and functionality making it more important than ever to BTC’s success.

Ethereum sees rapid fundamental growth despite market turbulence

Ethereum, like all major cryptocurrencies, has been subjected to immense volatility in recent times, with most of this turbulence favoring sellers.

The crypto has declined significantly from its February highs of $290 and has now remained caught within the mid-$100 region as its bulls struggle to maintain the momentum catalyzed by its drop below $100 a few weeks ago.

In spite of this bearish price action, ETH is fundamentally strong, as there is still nearly $700 million locked in DeFi loans, with this number climbing from recent lows of under $500 million.

Furthermore, data from the research and analytics platform IntoTheBlock also shows an uptick in daily active addresses, which started climbing heavily in late-March in tandem with a decline in zero-balance addresses.

This on-chain data seems to indicate growing activity amongst active investors, which may signal that they are currently engaged in accumulation.

ETH’s immense functionality may make it an integral part of Bitcoin’s future

One popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter known as Bitcoin Jack recently mused an interesting possibility when it comes to Ethereum’s importance within the crypto ecosystem, noting that its functionality makes it a “backbone” for Bitcoin’s growth and success. Jack said:

“Unpopular opinion: ETH has become the backbone to BTC. The amount of value already captured in ETH and the functionality provided to the ecosystem is impossible to ignore. Stablecoins (and DeFi) are becoming more important than ever. Big money understands this.”

It is an absolute fact that the ecosystems that are growing around Ethereum are important to the entire crypto industry’s growth, and if the world does look at ETH’s adoption and utility as a signal for that which Bitcoin may soon see, it could ultimately help catalyze further growth and adoption for BTC.

The lawsuits focus on the selling of cryptocurrency tokens, which are claimed to be unregistered securities.

One company has already settled with the SEC over an ICO.

In a coordinated strike against some of the best-known companies in crypto, a US law firm issued a barrage of class-action lawsuits aimed at Binance, Block.one, Bitmex, Tron and several others. The lawsuits allege that the firms bilked investors by selling unlawful securities in the form of digital tokens.

First spotted by the website Offshore Alert, the 11 suits were filed on Friday by the New York “litigation boutique” firm Roche Cyrulnik Freedman. The suits named 42 defendants in more than a dozen countries, including the British Virgin Islands, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Estonia, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malta, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, US, and Vietnam.

One of the lawsuits was served on Binance. Image: Shutterstock.

Offshore Alert called the event crypto’s own “Red Wedding,” in reference to a coordinated massacre that took place in the popular HBO series Game of Thrones.

Roche Cyrulnik Freedman was notably the same law firm behind the Bitfinex market manipulation suit in October 2019. The firm also represents the Kleiman estate in its billion-dollar lawsuit against self-professed Bitcoin inventor Craig Wright.

The lawsuits, all filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, have one theme in common: They all allege that the token issuers took advantage of the market’s lack of understanding and awareness of how cryptocurrencies worked. And they sold these alleged illegal securities to US citizens.

The suits assert that the companies pitched their tokens as so-called utility tokens, which they claimed did not need to be registered as securities. Some of the companies compared their tokens to Bitcoin and Ether (the native token of Ethereum), which are not considered securities. It wasn’t apparent to the investors that these tokens needed to be registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the lawsuits said.

A spokesperson for Block.One said, ""We are aware of the opportunistic complaints filed against several blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. We have not been served with any claims but are well prepared to address anything that may arise."" Binance declined to comment.

KuCoin, Quantstamp, Bibox, KayDex (Kyber Network) , Status, BProtocol (Bancor Network), and Civic were among the several other companies targetted in the suits. Also named in the suits were key company executives, including Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer and CTO Dan Larimer, Civic CEO Vinny Lingham, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as ""CZ.""

Plaintiffs included Chase Williams, Alexander Clifford, William Zhang and Eric Lee.

The lawsuits claim that tokens issued by the defendants fail the Howey Test, a check for determining whether an asset is a security under US federal law. One of the key tenets of the test is that an investment contract exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.

The cases are seeking damages to be determined at trial. Below is a quick summary of what we see as the four largest suits.

The lawsuit against Binance

The filing against Binance claims that the cryptocurrency exchange sold securities without a license. The suit lists 12 tokens including EOS, Bancor token (BNT) and Status token (SNT).

Binance and the issuers wrongfully engaged in millions of transactions—including the solicitation, offer, and sale of securities—without registering the tokens as securities, and without Binance registering with the SEC as an exchange or broker-dealer, it states.

The lawsuit goes through each token one by one and argues why it meets the definition of a security.

The class-action, filed on behalf of Binance users who purchased these tokens, estimates that the number of class members is in the tens of thousands. It seeks to recover damages for purchases of the tokens on Binance within the last three years.

The lawsuit against Tron

The lawsuit against Tron Foundation, the company behind cryptocurrency platform Tron, with offices in Singapore, San Francisco, and Beijing, alleges that from June 2017 to the present, the defendants (founder Justin Sun, CTO Zhiquiang Chen, and the Tron Foundation) “promoted, offered, and sold"" Tron's securities, otherwise known as TRX tokens, throughout the US in violation of securities laws.

Tron sold TRX in an initial coin offering, while Tron kept 35% of the TRX tokens for itself, according to the lawsuit.

Although TRX was a security, Tron did not register it as a security with the SEC and did not qualify for an exemption from registration requirements, the plaintiffs allege.

Further, the Tron whitepaper expressly stated that “TRX was not a security,” so that investors reasonably understood that at issuance it was not subject to US securities laws, according to court documents.

The lawsuit also notes that Sun, who founded the company, promoted Tron’s offerings as similar to and “better than” Ethereum. In multiple tweets, he touted Tron as being “better than” ETH, which, unlike TRX, is not a security.

Sun has named himself the “Ethereum killer” and further promoted Tron over Ethereum by announcing on Twitter that he wanted to create a fund to “rescue” developers working on Ethereum—and EOS—“from the collapse of their platform,” the lawsuit reads.

Plaintiffs in the case are seeking to recover what they paid for the TRX tokens with interest or the equivalent in monetary damages plus interest from the date of purchase.

The lawsuit against Block.one

This lawsuit claims that Block.one promoted, offered and sold the EOS token in the US. It refers to the $24 million settlement between Block.one and the SEC over this issue.

It claims that Dan Larimer, the company's CTO, appeared at the crypto conference Consensus in New York in May 2017 to promote EOS and that the token was even advertised on a billboard in Times Square.

The #EOS logo on the big screen over Times Square pic.twitter.com/Qs7H8v3d8t — Phil Mesnier (@PhilMesnier) May 22, 2017

The lawsuit claims to represent those who purchased EOS tokens in the ICO and those who purchased them via crypto exchanges

The lawsuit against BitMEX

The lawsuit filed against HDR Global Trading (the Seychelles-registered company that owns and operates the BitMEX cryptocurrency trading platform) claims that the firm sold securities—namely derivative products that reference the tokens EOS and SNT—without registering as a securities exchange.

“BitMEX offered these security futures products using statements posted on the Internet and distributed throughout the world, including throughout the United States, and the security futures products were offered and sold to Plaintiffs and the general public in the United States,” it states.

On this point, the lawsuit uses language similar to the other suits. But it makes further claims about price manipulation. It asserts that BitMEX traded against its own customers, via its trading desk, which was only revealed to exist in 2018.

""BitMEX acts like a casino with loaded dice, manipulating both its systems and the market its customers use for its own substantial financial gain,"" the lawsuit said.

On March 12, when the price of Bitcoin dropped 20%, BitMEX went offline for a short period of time. The lawsuit claims, “As a result of the outage, BitMEX did not dip into its Insurance Fund, but rather liquated [sic] $800 million of its customers’ highly leveraged positions for its own profit.”

We have reached out to the companies mentioned in this article and will update it if we hear back.

A cryptographer has posted an article discussing how he cracked an encrypted zip file to recover a lost hoard of Bitcoin keys. This story underscores the need to keep keys safe, and always remember passwords.

Bitcoin Private Keys Found By Cracking INFOZIP

The author, Mike Stay, has a Ph.D. in computer science and an extensive background in cryptography dating to the 1990s. He discusses how he was contacted and hired to crack an encrypted zip file from a man that read a paper he had written on the subject almost twenty years ago. The file contained the private keys to USD $300k worth of Bitcoins purchased in 2016, yet the man had forgotten the password.

He states:

Back in January of 2016, he had bought around $10K or $15K of Bitcoin and put the keys in an encrypted zip file. Now they were worth upwards of $300K and he couldn’t remember the password. Luckily, he still had the original laptop and knew exactly when the encryption took place. Because InfoZip seeds its entropy using the timestamp, that promised to reduce the work enormously—”only” 10 quintillion—and made it quite feasible, a matter of a couple of months on a medium GPU farm. We made a contract and I got to work.

Stay notes that he was able to re-learn his earlier skills, and with some help crack the zip file within a matter of days.

It is important to note that at no time did Stay crack the code to the keys themselves, nor did he compromise any other element of the Bitcoin protocol. Rather, he merely found the password to an encrypted zip file which could have contained any information.

Act Raises Security Concerns

Experts agree that the encryption behind Bitcoin and most other top altcoins is extremely secure, and attempts to crack private keys using presently-available techniques would be futile. Nevertheless, there remains a risk of theft or loss if such keys are not stored properly.

Unfortunately, all too often crypto investors store keys and passwords in unencrypted files, or they follow other lax procedures that put their coins at risk. Sometimes, as outlined in Stay’s story, they do not keep track of passwords. It is well known that almost all cryptocurrency theft and loss is due to user error.

It is impossible to know how many Bitcoins are now irretrievably lost. By some estimates, it is as high as 25% of all present in existence. Perhaps the most speculated upon are the more than one million Bitcoins known to be owned by Satoshi Nakamoto. These have remained unmoved for more than ten years. Craig Wright’s claims notwithstanding, one commonly believed theory is that Satoshi, whoever he is, can no longer access them.

Thus, it is crucially important to follow proper security guidelines when storing cryptocurrency. Passwords must be stored safely, and files encrypted using the latest techniques. Whereas there is no way to guarantee total security, improper personal handling is a very easy way to lose access to funds.

Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro has announced that he is airdropping cryptocurrency to every doctor in his country as a token of appreciation for their work to combat the coronavirus outbreak. The national cryptocurrency, the petro, will be distributed via the Homeland card (Carnet de la Patria).

Petro Airdrop to All Venezuelan Doctors

The president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, is airdropping the country’s cryptocurrency, the petro (PTR), to all doctors in Venezuela as a special bonus for their work to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The Twitter account for the Homeland card (Carnet de la Patria) announced on Wednesday:

Thanks to President Nicolas Maduro, the delivery of the special bonus for all doctors of the country has begun in the amount of 1 petro through the Carnet de la Patria.

Carnet de la Patria is the Venezuelan identity document that includes a unique personalized QR code; it was created in 2016 by the Venezuelan government.

Venezolana de Televisión, a state-run TV station based in Caracas, noted that “through the Homeland platform, this benefit will be delivered to all those doctors as part of the recognition and thanks for the support to carry out the noble work of protecting the health of the Venezuelan people in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic that plagues humanity.”

This is not the first time Maduro airdrops the petro to Venezuelan citizens. Last year, he airdropped it to retirees and pensioners and claimed in January this year that almost 6 million families in the country had used the cryptocurrency as a payment method.

How Much Is a Petro Worth?

According to the Venezuelan government’s official exchange rate, at the time of this writing, one petro can be exchanged for 0.00874729 BTC, 58.92 U.S. dollars, 4,989,701 bolivars, 54.23 euros, or 417.23 yuan.

However, the petro can be purchased on the open market at a fraction of the price set by the Venezuelan government, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. Venezuelans can use the Petroapp, provided by the government, to manage their petros and other cryptocurrencies: BTC, LTC, and DASH. The app also lets them exchange, buy, or transfer the petro, as well as use it to pay for goods and services.

Maduro’s Trouble With US Government

Maduro and a number of high-ranking Venezuelan officials have been charged by the U.S. government with “narco-terrorism, corruption, drug trafficking and other criminal charges,” the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced last week.

Several of the Venezuelan government officials charged allegedly partnered with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), Colombia’s largest rebel group, to “flood” the U.S. with cocaine, the DOJ claims.

Furthermore, the U.S. Department of State is offering rewards of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro. A $10 million bounty has also been placed on a few other high-ranking Venezuelan officials. Meanwhile, last month, Maduro ordered bank closures amid the coronavirus scare.

In this regard, Binance — the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange — has recently reached an agreement to acquire CoinMarketCap, one of the most prominent crypto data websites.

The official announcement was made by both companies on April 2, with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao telling Cointelegraph that CMC and Binance have from the very start been working to make the crypto ecosystem more accessible to people all over the world. Additionally, he also believes that this latest deal will help the two companies build on each other’s strengths, as well as make the industry more transparent and approachable.

Zhao further pointed out that his team had been in discussions with CMC for a few months and that he could not comment on the financial aspect of the deal since it has been legally secured using a non-disclosure agreement. With that being said, it is rumored that the buyout is worth an astonishing $400 million.

What to make of it all?

Providing his thoughts on the matter, Eric Benz, the CEO of Changelly, a crypto exchange, told Cointelegraph that having known the CoinMarketCap team for many years now, he is confident that this deal will benefit both parties. In his view, the timing of the agreement for Binance couldn’t have been better, as the impact of the coronavirus is being felt across many different industries. He added:

“If there was any acquisition to be made in this crypto climate, then CMC was it. Binance has done a wonderful job to make this happen and also wish them the utmost success in making this platform even better for its users. On the one hand, it might appear to be a one-sided deal, but on the other, it shows just how important crypto market data is, and this is merely the beginning of the merger and acquisition phase of crypto.”

A similar outlook is shared by Mike Alfred, the CEO and co-founder of Digital Assets Data, a fintech firm, who told Cointelegraph that Binance is among the strongest and most respected companies currently operating within the crypto ecosystem, and thus it came as no surprise that they are acting decisively during a period when many firms have become quite limited in their overall operational and financial capacities. Alfred further opined:

“The deal is highly strategic on multiple levels and will put Binance in an even more powerful position relative to other exchanges when BTC heads back towards all-time highs.”

Will the acquisition skew CMC’s operations?

Ever since the aforementioned news became mainstream, Binance has stated on several occasions that CMC will continue to operate as an independent business entity. In fact, CZ has claimed that the acquisition will not change CMC's independence from external stakeholders, suggesting that his company’s actions will not have any sort of impact on the data platform’s rankings whatsoever.

However, in the short term, CMC will face minor internal restructuring, as the company’s founder and current CEO, Brandon Chez, will step down to be replaced by CMC’s current chief strategy officer, Carylyne Chan — who will serve as the interim CEO.

According to David Wachsman, the founder and CEO of Wachsman, a blockchain PR firm, CMC’s new CEO, Carylyne Chan, has earned a global reputation as an executive who values transparency and fairness above all else. Moreover, from a commercial perspective, Wachsman told Cointelegraph that any skewing of results — on Binance’s behalf — would inevitably result in a deleterious effect on CMC's traffic, including the usage of the firm’s proprietary data in price oracles. Wachsman further added:

“Binance’s acquisition of CoinMarketCap is a clear signal that major crypto media sites and trusted digital asset data companies –– those with strong numbers and a sticky user base –– have marketable equity value. Because of the executive team’s integrity and because the value of the CoinMarketCap property is based on trust in that data, I am convinced that CMC will stay the course as an independent organization.”

Similarly, Erick Pinos, the American ecosystem lead at Ontology, a public blockchain project and distributed trust collaboration platform, told Cointelegraph that similar company acquisitions made by Binance in the past have until now continued to operate as separate entities.

However, he did concede that most of these projects have ended up integrating one or more of Binance’s native offerings into their core service portfolio — Trust Wallet, for example, is a multi-token wallet that added Binance’s DEX after it was bought out by the crypto giant. Pinos further stated:

“I would imagine there will be more links throughout CMC to Binance, perhaps encouraging users to sign up for Binance to trade the tokens they are looking at. If CMC’s rankings became partial to Binance, it would quickly be detected by the community. I think it’s likely that we will see Binance carry out subtle and small integrations over a longer period of time.”

How does the buyout affect CMC and Binance?

From a purely monetary perspective, the deal seems to make sense for CMC since the platform already has a steady revenue-generating business with its advertisements and paid API plans.

Providing his technical insights on this issue, Jason Wu, the founder and CEO of DeFiner.org, a decentralized lending platform, told Cointelegraph that Binance is constantly looking for ways to penetrate the United States market. In this regard, he pointed out that in February 2020, CoinMarketCap registered 5.19 million visits from American users, which is roughly 14.1% of the company’s web traffic, while Binance only had 8% of its web traffic come from the U.S. — roughly translating to around 1.9 million web hits. He added: “Acquiring CMC will help Binance grow its U.S. user base. For CMC, this acquisition will help them grow in other regions as well.”

Additionally, Wachsman believes that CoinMarketCap now has an enviable array of options when it comes to becoming increasingly commercialized. For starters, as an online advertising platform, it is still a good option for those looking to get their message across to crypto enthusiasts in a multitude of regions. Moreover, Wachsman highlighted that financial support from Binance may only increase CMC’s attractiveness as well as turn the data platform into a major generator of leads for new registrants.

Lastly, enumerating the reasons why Binance went ahead and bought CMC amid such uncertain times, Piers Ridyard, the CEO of Radix DLT, a high-throughput protocol, told Cointelegraph that Binance acquired CMC primarily because of two key factors: namely customer acquisition and data flow. He added:

“While Binance will increase CMC’s brand equity as much as it can over the coming years, they will do that because of the huge benefit they reap in user acquisition and better data about the whole market. Another way of thinking about it is this vs. 10 years of Google Ad spending for Binance. $40M per year in ad spending is probably substantially cheap vs. their new cost per acquisition if Binance and the CMC team keep building the CMC brand.”

Furthermore, Ridyard believes that CZ has a long-term plan in mind with respect to this acquisition, and as time passes, he will most likely use this opportunity to squeeze a number of his company’s core competitors out of the market. Also, he expects to see the industry continue on its current path of consolidation, wherein cash-rich buyers will continue to “snap up good strategic plays at cheaper prices.” Ridyard closed out by saying:

“The CMC acquisition is likely firstly a data play — giving Binance some massively key insights into the market beyond its own user base. Beyond that, I think that CMC’s user-facing operations will be unchanged; for exchanges, the story might shift substantially in the next couple of years.”

What Lies Ahead?

Even though a huge portion of the global crypto community seems to believe that this latest acquisition by Binance is a sign of the crypto industry becoming stronger, Evgen Verzun, the founder of HyperSphere.AI, a decentralized cloud, told Cointelegraph that the deal is just a mere reflection of the coronavirus-induced economic crisis that is forcing investors and businesses to find new ways to save their money.

The aforementioned comment seems to be in line with recent reports that suggested that CoinMarketCap had been facing quite a few financial constraints since 2019 — even forcing the company to carry out its day-to-day operations with minimal monetary resources. For example, in October 2019, Chan stated that CMC was going to continue with its policy of “bootstrapping and scaling” in the foreseeable future.","Could Cryptocurrencies Ever Be Anything More Than the Creation of Money Out of Thin Air?

Something many people cannot seem to wrap their heads around is the concept of cryptocurrencies - how are cryptocurrencies created? What makes them valuable? To understand this, let’s take a brief look back at the history of money.

A cow for 100 cowrie shells?

It all started with barter trading in the past, where people transfer value through direct exchange of goods and services with each other. With the growth of civilisation and rise of the institution, we see the transition from the barter system to the monetary system.

Here, value is not transferred directly but rather through a medium of exchange. Fiat money, for example, marks the shift to a centralised legal tender backed by institutions such as the bank or the government.

Digital payment revolution

The rise of the digital age and globalisation has brought about the online payment revolution, with more technological disruptions being witnessed in the last 10 years than the previous 35 years in the payment landscape. We see the shift to a cashless system with the wide array of digital payment options and infrastructure available - from debit and credit cards payment, internet banking (iBanking), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system to mobile payment wallets.

Growth for the eCommerce industry has also been promising with an anticipated 276.9% increase in worldwide eCommerce sales from 2014 to 2021. This has led to an accelerated demand for the cashless system while physical money is on the decline, paving the way for digital currencies to take on a much larger role in the global economy.

Emerging technology - artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT)

Technological advancements in the areas of AI and IoT have also expedited the fintech revolution, expanding ways in which payment could be made. It has enabled the growth of contactless payments on phones and wearables such as WeChat Pay on leading mobile chat, Wechat and Apple Pay, Apple’s popular payment solution which is also accessible on its smartwatch. Through AI, Amazon has envisioned to create a more ‘naturalistic’ payments journey via innovations such as its Echo smart speaker which allows customers to make purchases online via voice command.

Money is nothing but a form of social construct

As history shows, there is no intrinsic value of money. Rather, money is a form of social construct - where the value is set by the masses and determined through a shared consensus. Money has evolved through the ages, based on societal needs and demand at any point in time.

Cryptocurrencies - the next frontier?

""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""

Was the secret message imbued within Bitcoin’s Genesis Block raw data. It alluded to the headline in January 3rd, 2009 edition of The Times, a London-based newspaper, which reported the British government’s failure to stimulate the economy following the 2008 financial crisis.

Satoshi’s deliberate effort to include this message in the genesis block speaks to his ultimate mission with cryptocurrency and rejection of the centralized fiat system.

Cryptocurrencies, as decentralised currencies where every transaction can be traced on a distributed digital ledger, can thus be seen as fighting against money being created out of thin air rather than being money created out of thin air.

Backed by the decentralised and distributed nature of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies could offer a much more reliable and powerful transaction method that could disrupt traditional payment infrastructure.

Enabling quick, transparent and traceable payment like never before

Fundamental to the current payment ecosystem is the trust users have to place in the governing body, such as banks or payment systems. Often, users have no way of tracking their transactions and have to wait days for cross-border transactions to pass through.

Although current payment solutions such as SWIFT network which enables banks to send money to one another have helped improve issues surrounding transaction speed and traceability, there are still limitations to this system.

For one, SWIFT is a closed network which only member banks can utilise. As a centralised network, SWIFT is also susceptible to breaches - just last year, Banco de Chile, Chile’s second-largest bank lost about $10 million due to fraudulent SWIFT wire transfers while the theft of more than $100 million via fraudulent SWIFT transfers has been linked to a North Korea hacker gang.

On the other hand, Blockchain technology with its decentralised and distributed nature has the added advantages of ensuring inclusivity and security with its permissionless distributed ledger accessible by any and everyone.

With data no longer held by a centralised body but instead held by every individual node, blockchain technology has democratised trust.

More than just money

Through the use of cryptography, a form of data encryption, cryptocurrencies have birthed a new class of money - programmable money. Novel cryptography protocols have enabled cryptocurrencies to go beyond their role as merely a medium of exchange, enabling them to further value add to the current payment ecosystem.

Bitcoin first brought peer-to-peer transactions to the people while Ethereum, another cryptocurrency has introduced the next generation platform touted as the “world’s computer”.

Smart contracts, a transaction protocol developed for automated proofing and execution of conditions of a contract between different parties is an example of a powerful feature enabled by blockchain technology.

It shifts the control from an unreliable central body to the system of codes where transactions are immutable and irrevocable, helping to improve security and preventing fraud in transactions.

Making waves in the payments landscape

The adoption rate of cryptocurrencies as an alternative payment method has also been gaining traction in the past few years. Notable mainstream companies have adopted the use of cryptocurrencies such as Samsung integrating a cryptocurrency wallet for its flagship phone, the Galaxy S10 and supporting four decentralized apps (dApps) at launch.

Korea’s biggest messaging application Kakao is also offering a crypto wallet for 44 million users. Cryptocurrency payment service providers such as Bitpay and Coingate have also help speed up the adoption of cryptocurrencies as a payment method by offering companies a simple and seamless integration solution.

For example, Bitpay has partnered with popular mainstream companies such as Microsoft, Shopify and Virgin Galactic to support selected cryptocurrencies as a payment method on their platform.

A Deloitte study has estimated a 40% to 80% reduction in transaction costs business-to-business and person-to-person payments with blockchain, and a reduction of transaction speed from two to three days to an average of four to six seconds. This further highlights the benefits of adopting this technology for the masses.

Other than just being a supplementary payment method, blockchain technology is also reinventing the payment ecosystem as the world’s first programmable money.

By eliminating the middleman, blockchain technology has removed excessive silos while encouraging interoperability in the ecosystem. With the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, demand for cryptocurrency related infrastructure such as bitcoin ATMs, POS systems such as Pundi X and hardware wallets such as ledger wallets have also increased exponentially.

Despite growing acceptance, challenges still remain, with a recent survey by Kaspersky Labs suggesting that cryptocurrency-based payments are still one of the least popular methods for conducting online payments.

To succeed, blockchain technology needs to integrate and co-exist alongside the current payments infrastructure.

Ultimately, adoption is still key - whether cryptocurrencies will become a prominent part of the payment ecosystem is still yet to be determined but the future does indeed look bright.

2020-04-05,"Key Takeaways In the early days, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were used to buy drugs.

Illicit activity as a percentage of total activity has fallen dramatically over the past few years.

Bitcoin does not offer the anonymity some might think.

Share this article

Contrary to public perception, the drug trade is hardly a driving force behind Bitcoin adoption. BTC’s use in illegal activity is quickly dwindling as the asset enters the mainstream.

The Early Days of Bitcoin

Bitcoin was created in 2008 as an electronic peer-to-peer payment system. There is some evidence that in the earlier days of Bitcoin, one compelling use case was for buying drugs, weapons, and other illicit substances on the dark web.

The dark web consists of internet sites that are not cataloged by search engines and that are only accessible using a Tor browser. Some of the sites on the dark web are marketplaces for illegal goods and controlled substances.

Silk Road was a high-profile online marketplace for drugs, guns, assassination contracts, and stolen credit cards, among other things. It operated between 2011 and 2013, and was shut down after it was seized by the FBI.

Bitcoin’s Dark Past

Silk road offered anonymity to surfers and participants in the marketplace, but they still needed a way to exchange money. Ross Ulbricht, the site’s founder, provided a payment service using Bitcoin. He created an escrow service between buyers and sellers and took a commission from every transaction.

The Bitcoin-based site saw over a million transactions in its brief history. According to analysis from crypto sleuthing firm Chainalysis, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been used extensively in dark net environments. Since 2014, Bitcoin spending on illicit purchases grew from around $250 million, to peak at almost $1 billion in 2017.

Times Are Changing

Since the bull market of 2017, the use of Bitcoin for illegal purposes as a percentage of its total use has dwindled. Chainalysis has found that the percentage of Bitcoin transactions involved in criminal activity fell from 30% in 2012 to 1% in 2017.

Using Bitcoin to buy drugs leaves a trail of evidence that law enforcement agencies are becoming more skillful at examining. In 2017, the U.S. Justice Department sold almost 150,000 Bitcoin seized from Silk Road, for around $48 million. That sale followed two prior auctions in 2014 and 2015.

The fall in the use of Bitcoin for illicit purposes as a percentage of total activity is a function of two forces. Firstly, Bitcoin is not as effective at hiding a user’s identity as some might think. And secondly, Bitcoin is gradually climbing as a mainstream method of making purchases and investing.

Bitcoin transactions occur on a decentralized, public blockchain, making all activity traceable. With a large, permanent record of publicly viewable transactions, analysis firms and law enforcement can trace Bitcoin transactions to specific addresses.

Those transactions can only be traced to Bitcoin addresses, which can be created without any links to a real person’s ID. But as exchanges and other crypto services increasingly impose KYC rules on their users, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly less useful as a way to transact anonymously. Even if proceeds from crime can be transmitted in crypto, it is becoming more difficult to turn those funds into cash.

Mixing services have been seen as a way for users involved in illicit activity to hide their transactions from authorities. However, an Elliptic study published in 2018 found:

“While most types of conversion services have received some bitcoins from illicit activity, the vast majority of the funds they receive do not appear to be illicit.”

And compared to cash, the level of criminality involved with cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being the most significant by far, is minuscule. The United Nations found that somewhere between $800 billion and $2 trillion worth of fiat is laundered annually to cloak criminal activity. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is worth less than $200 billion at press time.

So Is Bitcoin Used To Buy Drugs?

Bitcoin is no doubt still used to buy drugs online. But it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to use for illicit purposes and expect to remain anonymous. Blockchain tracking and tracing capabilities have improved markedly since 2008. Any transaction found to have involved the purchase of narcotics is permanently time-stamped into history.

And as Bitcoin becomes more attractive to legacy institutions like hedge funds and pension funds as an investment vehicle, its use in crime will likely continue to fall both as a percentage of total activity and because that use case will only become less viable.

Digital investment company Grayscale recorded inflows of around $600 million in 2019, signaling that interest in Bitcoin as an investment is surging. Conservative institutional money will likely have the impact of squeezing illicit activity from the market as well as render it proportionally insignificant.

The company famously ran the #dropgold campaign to highlight the benefits of digital assets to investors. It is no coincidence that institutional demand for Bitcoin has coincided with the emergence of KYC/AML requirements at crypto exchanges and the rise of crypto sleuthing companies. Both factors are poised to dampen crypto criminality and make it very much a thing of the past.

While it is, of course, possible to buy drugs with Bitcoin, when it comes to crime, cash remains king.","Bitcoin trading volumes across The Block 22 exchanges saw a significant uptick during the first quarter of 2020.

The volumes reached over $154 billion in the quarter – a 61% increase over the previous quarter figure of $96 billion, according to research conducted by The Block's Steven Zheng.

The quarterly average price of bitcoin, however, increased only about 4% on a quarter-on-quarter basis.





Despite an increase in trading volumes, the value transacted on the bitcoin network saw a relatively minor rise of 11% in Q1 2020 when compared to the previous quarter. During the first quarter, users transacted over $178 billion in BTC, at an average of $1.98 billion a day.

On the M&A side, crypto-native acquirers took 56 percent of the deal flow, compared to 42 percent in 2018. The total number of M&A deals flagged by the report dropped from 189 in 2018 to 114 last year, while the value of M&A deals dropped by a whopping 76 percent from $1.9 billion to $451 million.

Larger companies were able to eat up ones that provided services that were ancillary to their own, PwC Global Crypto Lead Henri Arslanian told CoinDesk in an interview.

“I think we should expect some of the big players to get bigger, but not by buying direct competitors,” Arslanian said. “Not by becoming vertically bigger but by becoming horizontally bigger. Unicorns are becoming more like octopuses where they have their hands in various areas of the crypto ecosystem.”

Meanwhile, the declines on the fundraising side of the report weren’t quite as stark. Post-seed rounds took up eight percentage points more of overall fundraising deals in 2019, a sign of the sector’s maturation.

“I think that’s something we should expect to see as well, as the industry matures, there will be enough deal flow and there will be enough exits as well to allow many of the crypto VCs to be successful,” he said.

Fundraising overall decreased by 40 percent to $2.24 billion and the number of deals dropped by 122. Equity fundraising decreased by less, showing only an 18 percent drop. The rise of bitcoin in the second and third quarter of 2019 didn’t stave off the funding drop, and the industry should assume going into 2020 that the global economic downturn will further affect funding deals, the report said.

Last year did see a doubling of corporate venture capital involvement, taking up 6 percent of the deals. As clear regulatory frameworks in Europe and Asia begin to develop, more institutional players are taking notice. Family offices with long-term investment strategies that Arslanian advises continue to show more interest in crypto over time, he said.

The type of companies receiving investment also changed year-to-year. In 2018, most VC funding went to blockchain infrastructure projects while crypto compliance and regulatory companies saw the most investment in 2019.

Deal flow is also moving away from the Americas and towards Asia and Europe, which increased their deal share by eight and six percentage points, respectively. Last year was the first year most of the crypto fundraising and M&A deals happened outside of the U.S.

Companies looking for new institutional clients are flocking to Hong Kong while firms looking for a retail audience are considering Singapore’s new regulatory framework, Arslanian added.

“We’ve definitely seen a number of the large players from the U.S. and from Europe really look at Asia not only from an expansion perspective but also as a point of fundraising from strategic investors,” he said.","March observed some of the highest volumes in crypto exchange history. Image: Shutterstock

In brief March was a record month for crypto exchanges.

Binance and FTX represented 22% of the derivatives market share.

Binance traded $63.6 billion within the month.

Last month’s cataclysmic crypto market collapse made March a record-breaking month for several leading exchanges, with one exchange trading $11.8 million in a single minute.

Exchanges hit an all-time high daily volume of $75.9 billion on March 12-13, according to a report by cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoCompare, published Saturday. Top tier exchanges such as Binance and BitMEX accounted for $21.6bn, or 28.5% of the total volume.

The skyrocketing earnings show how exchanges, which make their money from transaction fees and are generally immune to downturns in price, benefit even when the markets are in freefall.

Bitcoin’s crash in early March, which witnessed the entire cryptocurrency market wipe $25 billion from its total market cap, prompted a flurry of panicked trading. Whether the price went up or down, the exchanges reaped the rewards.

Crypto exchange Bitfinex saw the highest volume throughout the first hour of the collapse. According to the report, between 10.40 am, and 11 am on March 12, Bitfinex accounted for 40% of all top tier exchange volume, trading a remarkable $11.8 million in a single minute.

Binance meanwhile became the largest Top Tier exchange by volume in March, according to the report, trading $63.6 billion—an increase of 19.2%.

Derivatives exchanges offering lucrative—albeit high-risk—incentives to traders also saw a significant uptick. Volumes on OKEx, BitMEX, Huobi, and Binance totaled $600 million, while Binance and FTX saw their volumes increase by 94 percent and 27 percent.

On futures trading exchange BitMEX, meanwhile, well over $750 million in Bitcoin long positions were liquidated in a single stroke, as a result of the “flash crash.”

Crypto exchanges didn't just benefit from higher volumes. Last month, as reported by Decrypt, several exchanges reported a considerable uptick in user sign-ups as well, with many citing the coronavirus outbreak as the probable cause.","Where to Buy Bitcoin in India: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Lower Their Fees

Since the supreme court lifted the RBI ban, more people have been looking to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in India. Responding to community feedback, a number of cryptocurrency exchanges have lowered their fees as the Indian crypto sector continues to grow.

Indian Crypto Exchanges Cutting Fees

The Indian crypto sector has been growing ever since the Supreme Court of India lifted the banking ban imposed by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). More people are now interested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and local crypto exchanges are seeing increased trade volumes and signups, even during the nationwide lockdown.

One of the main factors why a user chooses one cryptocurrency exchange over another is the fee structure. Due to popular demand on social media, a number of crypto trading platforms have lowered their fees. Below are some popular bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges in India, as well as the fees they are charging.

Wazirx, a popular crypto exchange in the country, charges 0.1% when paid through WRX, CEO Nischal Shetty told news.Bitcoin.com. “We lowered our USDT fees to make it zero fees for transfer to Binance,” he detailed. “So effectively maximum users in India now enjoy 0 fee USDT transfer from Wazirx to Binance and for other withdrawals, the fee has been lowered to 1.5 USDT.” The CEO further shared, “We’re planning to lower withdrawal fees for other tokens as well over time.” Wazirx’s fees can be found here.

Zebpay, formerly one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in India, recently relaunched in the country. The exchange announced that starting Friday it is waiving “the normal 1.5% netbanking fee through April 10.” Furthermore, “users can trade BTC-USDT, ETH-USDT, XRP-USDT, ETH-BTC & TUSD-USDT with no trading fees this month.” The exchange currently charges a withdrawal fee of 0.00049 BTC. Zebpay’s fees can be found here.

Other Indian Exchanges With Competitive Fees

Some cryptocurrency trading platforms have already been focusing on offering competitive fees to their users. Popular Indian crypto exchange Coindcx charges 0.0005 BTC for withdrawals. CEO Sumit Gupta shared with news.Bitcoin.com: “We have been competitive since [the] start as a policy as we believe in crypto adoption. As we have been maintaining the best price, compared to some competitors, we didn’t have to bring the fees down.” Coindcx’s fees can be found here.

Unocoin, one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges in India, charges a fee of 0.7% to buy or sell bitcoin. Users can upgrade to a gold membership and the fee will drop to 0.5%. Unocoin’s fees can be found here.

Other well known cryptocurrency exchanges in India include Cashaa, Pocketbits, Giottus, and Bitbns. London-based banking platform Cashaa launched its Indian operations in October last year; its fees can be found here. Pocketbits advertises 0% trading fees and a BTC withdrawal fee of 0.0003 BTC; its fees can be found here. Giottus offers a BTC withdrawal fee of 0.0001 BTC, and the platform’s fee schedule can be found here. Bitbns charges a BTC withdrawal fee of 0.0005 BTC; its fees can be found here.

Furthermore, Indians can also use peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Localbitcoins and Paxful to buy and sell bitcoins directly from sellers in INR. They can also use local.Bitcoin.com to buy and sell BCH. India currently has no direct cryptocurrency regulation but the government is reportedly discussing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies with the central bank.

The result which was released on April 1, 2020, is but a few weeks after the encouraging dismissal of a previous RBI directive on cryptocurrency trading on one of Asia’s leading economic powerhouses.

How India Feels about Digital Currencies

And it was all about sentiment.

After polling Indians of between 18 and 55 years, of which 75% had crypto holdings, the platform sought to find the position of crypto as a driver of the Indian economy, and which industry will drive crypto adoption the most.

In addition, the survey wanted to know the opinion of crypto holders in the country and their sentiment towards digital currencies.

The results were astounding.

Crypto as a Vehicle of Financial Inclusion

75.8 percent of those surveyed revealed that they used cryptocurrencies to easily and fairly transfer money.

Another 64.8 percent believed that holding cryptocurrencies was a path towards financial freedom. However, what was interesting is that 51 percent of those who took part in the survey strongly believed that cryptocurrencies are agents of financial inclusion.

In a world where not everyone can access services from traditional financial providers, the peer-to-peer nature of leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, for example, enable not only a cheap and fairway of transferring value across geographies but the lack of banks in the equation, most of who are expensive makes it possible for those in the periphery to send and receive funds.

Paxful Survey: KYC and AML Indispensable

The benefits of cryptocurrencies were also highlighted.

Paxful notes that a “bulk of survey respondents believing heaBTCUSDvily in the benefits of crypto.”

Still, they believe that the aspect of regulation and specifically the implementation of KYC and AML will play a big role in driving adoption.

“Indians see crypto enterprises thriving due to the lift of the ban at 64.8% with the retail sector following at 52.2%. They are also heavily calling on regulation with 75.60% of respondents believing that KYC and regulatory frameworks (58.60%) are most important to the continued success of digital assets.”

Update 2: ScreenRant reports that (according to an alleged developer of the game who wishes to remain anonymous) the crypto currency was never a part of the game, and the developers would not have been capable of doing so.

“The statement about crypto-currency was all buzz words. The head of planet entertainment knows very little about these things… he just put some fancy language to get potential investors who like that stuff. As for the crashes/ overheating. That would be because the game is made in unity. By many people working on their first game… it’s not the best product but it made it through several vigorous reviews by nintendo and Sony. There is no way crypto-mining stuff could get through those tests. I doubt anyone at 1p would even be able to make such a thing.”

The claim of the head of Planet Entertainment not being knowledgeable in the blockchain technology his company was pushing is rather shocking. Moreso considering the pedigree of the individuals involved with the company.

The “several vigorous reviews by nintendo and Sony” would seem to indicate the game was planned for PlayStation 4 at some point.

Regarding how the Cooking Mama IP was being used, the source claims “There is a legal battle between the publisher, planet entertainment and the ip holder, office create.” It should be noted Office Create are now known as Cooking Mama Limited, changing their name in May 2009.

The dispute came about as “planet entertainment released the game against a request by office create to keep polishing the game, or perhaps even canceling it.” The lack of communication between the publisher and developer was said to be “pretty standard.”

The business relationship between Cooking Mama Limited (still referred to as Office Create by the source) broke down, and when they discovered the game had been published without their consent, they contacted Nintendo to pull the game from the Nintendo e-Shop and stop production of physical copies.

“At one point the japanese official create clients came to oversee development. An argument started and the clients were told to go home if they weren’t being ‘constuctive’. Once they found out that planet entertainment released the game, they used their nintendo contacts to pull it from the e-shop and stop production of cartridges. Overall, everyone at 1p loves the cooking mama franchise and did their best to make the best product considering the interference from the higher ups. I think the game is far from perfect, but would have done fine without the publishers stumbling so constantly…”

The source was asked if the game had been released without any of the development team knowing in advance. They stated that the last they knew, the game was launching in March. The source also revealed that Planet Entertainment is suing Cooking Mama Limited.

“It’s hard to say. We were told the game was coming out in March. That’s all anyone knew. The boss at 1p, tobi, keeps that kind of thing to herself mostly stating she doesn’t want to stress us with the details… Advertising was blocked by office create too. There were youtube ads, websites, and even tik tok ads that never came out.” “As I understand planet entertainment is sueing office create having it removed for money lost. It’s hard to say if it will ever be released properly.”

If all of the above is true, our new conclusion would be that Planet Entertainment were producing a Cooking Mama game, but not to the satisfaction of the IP holder. When communication broke down, Planet Entertainment still released the game against the developer’s wishes.

Planet Entertainment seemingly attempted to court investors using blockchain terminology, even if it was never intended to be in the game.

As such, there is more doubt cast over Planet Entertainment. What else have they lied about? Why are they silent at this time?

We will continue to investigate.

Update: The game’s developer, 1st Playable, have replied to requests for clarity made by users on Twitter.

They state they were frustrated by the situation with the game’s distribution, and denied any claims of “cryptocurrency or data collection or blockchain or anything else shady in the code.”

Regarding the earlier press release from Planet Digital containing the mention of block chains and crypto currency based terminology, they state that they presume it was hypothetical. They also state it was never discussed with them, and “were entertained to hear about [it] in late 2019.”

They also state they were “not directly involved with the eshop issue,” and refute claims of the game having any issues with causing the Nintendo Switch to overheat or quickly drain its battery.

You can find their replies archived here [1, 2], and below.

“Yes! As per the box and the credits. We’re proud of the game, and frustrated as everyone with the distribution situation. But copies are out there and we’re loving the shares!” “As the developers we can say with certainty there is no cryptocurrency or data collection or blockchain or anything else shady in the code. The Nintendo Switch is a very safe platform, with none of the data and privacy issues associated with some mobile and PC games.” “This is a release from Feb 2019, and we presume hypothetical like most releases about blockchain are. Blockchain was never brought up to us developers, and we were entertained to hear about in late 2019. Not happening anytime soon.” “Those are all rumors. The game is fine. We’ve playing it for months, the team just got our retail copies and they work as expected. There’s no technical issues with the game, and although we’re not directly involved with the eshop issue we are hoping it will get sorted out soon.”

We have reached out to them for additional information.

Original Story:

Serious yet bizarre claims have been leveled at Cooking Mama: CookStar, stating the game uses the Nintendo Switch as a crypto currency mining machine.

The claims are also backed by bizarre behavior surrounding the game’s launch and publicity.

The Rumor

The rumor came from a singular tweet, of a screencapture from a Discord message.

The message appears to have a screenshot of yet another Discord user, allegedly “Cybershroom“. In summation, they claim that the publisher (Planet Entertainment) did not receive permission to produce the game from the owners (Cooking Mama Limited). The company’s headquarters also said to be a residential home.

They further claim a press release described the game as having “blockchain-based DRM”. The game does not launch unless you are online, and when you do “Switch network traffic skyrockets, battery life craters, and the thing overheats in about half an hour.”

Another user “UHOHBRO”, claims this is so the game can be used in crypto currency mining. In basic terms, crypto currency mining allows users to generate virtual currency, in exchange for their computer being used to transfer data.

Doing so without a user’s consent is illegal, usually due to involving hacking, or not disclosing the true purpose of a program and its risks.

Is it True?

Relying on the testimony of an anonymous message on the internet would usually be laughable. Even illicit attempts to use a computer for crypto mining would usually focus on more powerful systems, and a more stable internet connection (such as home computers). More processing means more “mining”.

However, some claims appear to be true. Cybershroom replied to our inquiries, stating that the image “was an out of context screencap of me just dumping info from a [sic] original 4chan thread.”

Across August 2019, numerous smaller outlets and Twitter users noted a press release the company launched [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. One of these people (Twitter user Daan Koopman) provided an archive of the webpage the press release was on. This same archive was also shown to us by Cybershroom on Twitter.

The press release states that the game will be “one of the first three games in Planet Digital’s portfolio that is funded by digital preferred shares. Planet Digital will democratize game funding for investors, who for the first time ever can own equity in a portfolio of console games.”

The President of Planet Digital Partners, Steve Grossman, also used some rather confusing terms to describe how blockchain technology itself would help generate profit for investors.

“Gaming is a $135 billion dollar industry with little opportunity to invest outside of the large public game publishers. We are using blockchain to add new innovative gameplay that investors can now have equity in. Putting aspects of Cooking Mama on-chain will take the user experience to a whole new level, reinvigorate a popular game franchise that many grew up with and give investors an opportunity to make handsome returns, through a digital preferred share offering.”

The blockchain would also allegedly enable the following.

“Unique Blockchain Private-Keys – Each purchased copy of the game will have unique IDs which will be managed directly through the game’s internal wallet storage. Players will be able to focus on Cooking Mama’s user experience rather than cryptographic key management.

While this may be biased with hindsight, it appears the press release is confirming that investors will be able to make profit via crypto currency, especially with terms such as “internal wallet storage.”

Combined with the phrase “Players will be able to focus on Cooking Mama’s user experience rather than cryptographic key management,” it seems the game is designed to be played, without players having to focus on managing the crypto currency wallet (such as passwords and verification).

The news most likely went unnoticed due to the aforementioned websites being focused on crypto currency, blockchain technologies, or websites with smaller communities. The press release itself was does not appear to have been shared on press release websites such as GamesPress.

The press release also states the company is based in Cincinnati, Ohio. It also appears to be an office, rather than residential areas. The staff page (as of this time of writing) now leads to a 404 error.

The press release states “Planet Digital Partners represents an all-star team of video game industry leaders including the former PlayStation Europe President, the founder of Take 2/Grand Theft Auto, the former CEO of Guitar Hero and hit-maker developers of Halo, Quake, and NBA Playgrounds. Brands including Bass Pro Shops, Cooking Mama and Cabela’s.”

One of the four people listed out of 12 employees on the company’s LinkedIn profile (which lists the company as being based in Fairfield, Connecticut) is Chris Deering- “president of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe from 1995 to 2005 and of Sony Electronics Europe from 2003 to 2005” [Wikipedia].

The LinkedIn profiles of Dean Simcock, nor Michael Stiegelmeyer would seem to indicate involvement with Guitar Hero, Halo, Quake, or NBA Playgrounds.

“The founder of Take 2/Grand Theft Auto” most likely refers to Kelly Sumner. Even so Ryan Brant would be technically more accurate as he founded Take-Two Interactive, while Sumner became CEO of Take Two.

An article by BlockChain Gamers confirm Sumner’s involvement, along with Planet Entertainment’s goals to “democratize the process of video game publishing, development and investment.” Another article by Breaker Mag explains Grossman’s proposal to use blockchain for the Bass Pro series (such as fish being finite).

As an aside, Sumner and Brant were sued by Take-Two Interactive in 2010 for fraud and insider trading. In the case summery, Sumner was one of 15 alleged of selling “some of their own stock while in possession of inside information” of a “backdating scheme”. However, the case was ultimately dismissed.

11 of the 12 employees were listed in an article by TechRaptor in January 2019. These include David Rosenbaum, Matt Karch, Andrey Iones, Michael Maloney, Jeff Hilbert, Edward Williams, and Patrick Baron. All names involved seem to be major figures with in the video game or blockchain-based industries.

The Planet Entertainment website (as of this time of writing) does not list the press release, or any trace of the game on their website [1, 2]. Even the game’s news page is entirely blank. Their official Twitter profile has also remained dormant since February 2019.

The announcement of the game was also strange. The game was (and still is, as of this time of writing) listed on Amazon Germany, and the Koch Media Shop [1, 2]- around August 2019 (judging by the Gematsu article’s publication date).

The game was also shown to be on PlayStation 4. Neither box mentions online DRM [1, 2], though curiously the PlayStation 4 version of the game shows Ravenscourt on the logo (a division of Koch Media), rather than Entertainment Planet.

A seemingly official Twitter account for the game made no mention of a PlayStation 4 version of the game, and also had very limited activity (only three posts in March 2020).

The game’s Facebook, and Instagram profiles also made little to no activity. Neither they, nor the game’s official website make any mention of the game being on PlayStation 4, or any form of always-online DRM.

The official twitter accounts [1, 2] and websites [1, 2] for Cooking Mama (Japanese and English) also make no mention of the game as of this time of writing.

The game’s announcement trailer leaked on February 19th. To our knowledge, this game was never officially shown by Nintendo in trailers or Nintendo Directs. An official account later uploaded the video on March 27th.

The game was listed by GameStop, though the PlayStation 4 version was taken down. This is supported by the 4Chan thread, where a user claimed “the pre-order for the game was dropped minutes after I saved the image.”

The image in question was of the PlayStation 4 box art. According to images taken by Wario64 (a Twitter account dedicated to video game news), the PlayStation 4 version states the game requires an internet connection on the box. Planet Entertainment is also on the box again, rather than Ravenscourt.

Around March 2020, people began to raise the alarm about how strange everything surrounding the game was, especially the original press release [1, 2, 3].

One YouTuber (Purple Pocket Pirate, who we shall refer to as P3) states that when he tried to access the game’s official website (on March 11th or prior), it lead to a GoDaddy page, offering the domain for sale (as the website was not active a week before the game’ then March release date).

P3 also highlights the videos on the official Planet Digital Partner’s YouTube account seem designed for investors, and have incredibly few views and subscribers considering who is involved.

He also highlights an interview Kelly Sumner gave to CNBC Africa, where he mentions using blockchain technology being used for Cooking Mama in February 2019, along with Cabela’s The Hunt, Bass Pro, and seven others.

P3 also takes issue with how the company appeared to have formed around 2019, yet the official website for the company was seemingly founded in 2018.

According to a later video by P3, YouTuber GameTim (with a series focused on recreating recipes from the Cooking Mama series in real life) had played the game on March 25th.

In the video focusing on the “rainbow grilled cheese” recipe, GameTim states that not only had a copy of the game early, but that he even “got to help out with development” of the game.

This is not elaborated in the video, nor the name of the developer or publisher who would have sent him the game (with YouTube having stricter terms of service in recent years, about reviewers not disclaiming when they were given a product).

P3 contacted GameTim. GameTim explained he had played a production build of the game, from a development kit.

“Planet entertainment reached out to me last May to help consult on it, mostly on a content and gameplay level (recipes, controls, look/feel, etc). It was really cool getting to work with that team, especially with a producer that has been with the franchise for over a decade.”

Considering the game is Japanese, and none of the staff shown have been involved with Cooking Mama Limited or any publisher of any game- it only raises more questions. Other than that, GameTim had no other new information. The video description also has an Amazon affiliate link, where the game can be purchased in the US.

A source (with no affiliation with any of the involved parties) also contacted us, explaining the game had seemingly been sold and distributed physically.

They claim that physical copies of the game can start, even when offline. They propose the physical editions of the game had the always online “feature” removed.

One of the aforementioned Twitter users who raised the alarm (DoesItPlay), states a physical version does exist, with another Twitter user sending them photos, along with other users.

There are also claims that those who have hacked the game found no crypto mining codes within, along with claims that the game works without an internet connection.

As of this time of writing, the official listing for the game on Nintendo.com now leads to an error page. IGN (citing Reddit and Twitter users) report the game was briefly available digitally, before being taken down. IGN also notes those selling the game on Amazon are third-party sellers.

GoNintendo (citing another Reddit post) report that the game was briefly made available digitally on March 26th. In another post, the user made no mention of any lag.

IGN also state they “tried to work out if Planet Entertainment could be the development arm of Planet Digital Partners, and looked up its listed company headquarters – it’s just a sizeable house in rural Connecticut.” However, they do not cite the Connecticut address, nor have we been able to find it.

The Verdict

This has to be one of the strangest cases we have ever seen, more akin to something during earlier times when the industry was less regulated and documented.

It appears that Planet Entertainment or Planet Digital Partner somehow managed to fly completely under everyone’s radar despite the people involved. While not a titanic franchise, a new Cooking Mama game from people that important should have made waves.

If the allegations of crypto mining are true, it seems those features were hastily removed, and the game was then unceremoniously dumped onto stores and anyone who would take it. Though claims of the game causing the console to overheat are bizzare.

If there was a scam in place, it begs why those involved did not use a more powerful system like the PlayStation 4, or better yet, home PCs. Or use a franchise that had a dedicated fan base (like Pro Bass fishing), but with more believable use of constant online play (rather than a puzzle or party-like game such as Cooking Mama).

Even falsely using someone else’s IP is bonkers, considering it puts more eyes on you. A cheap battle royale game made quickly, and advertised through YouTubers or other “influencers” would generate less bad press (until the crypto mining was discovered).

The sheer incompetence of all involved (in the scam’s concept and execution) is what raises so much doubt. Yet, attempting to sabotage a company with false claims is also nonsensical, considering how “cancel culture” tends to focus on crimes and abusive behavior.

If this game was damaging, its amazing Nintendo would not warn others and issue a recall (to protect itself), or if the game is now safe, sell and promote it officially. It is also amazing to think anyone would believe Nintendo would not check software it distributes does not utilize malware or violates the law.

Combined with the unclear mission statement of Planet Entertainment (or Planet Digital Partner), and how Koch Media are involved, we are left spinning our wheels. We have no idea what Mama’s been cooking with, but something is off.

Image: YouTube (thumbnail), Bitcoin.org","In brief -The Tor Project receives about 20% of its individual donations via cryptocurrency. -Stellar is matching Lumens (XLM) donations for six non-profits throughout April. -The company will match up to 1.9M XLM in total, alongside its own donations.

The Tor Project, the nonprofit organization behind the privacy-centric Tor Browser, receives approximately 20% of its individual donations via cryptocurrency.

Sarah Stevenson, the organization’s fundraising director, shared the statistic on Twitter on Friday while retweeting a charity matching campaign by Stellar and its Lumens (XLM) currency.

Thanks again to @StellarOrg for sponsoring this match to @torproject! We are seeing a boost in donations via other cryptocurrencies as well! Currently cryptocurrency donations make up 20% of our contributions from individuals. You rock! https://t.co/AQn7choEIt https://t.co/lw2nhxvv0U — Sarah Stevenson (@elkakai) April 3, 2020

The Tor Browser is a web browser designed to safeguard its users’ anonymity, and also serves as an entryway to the dark web. Cryptocurrency is often used for anonymous purchases on the dark web, including for illicit items and services.

The Tor Project has accepted Bitcoin donations for years and added support for other cryptocurrencies in March 2019. Now it accepts a number of cryptocurrencies for donations, such as Ethereum, Zcash, Litecoin, Monero, and Stellar. The organization’s website also has a BTCPay Server tool for quick donations, plus Tor accepts credit card and PayPal donations.

Stellar’s TOR campaign

Throughout April, Stellar is matching donations made in XLM to six non-profit organizations: UNICEF France, The Tor Project, Heifer International, Watsi, Freedom of the Press, and Women Who Code.

Stellar launched the campaign in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and has committed to matching a total of up to 1.9 million XLM (about $75,600 USD) in donations made directly to each organization.

Additionally, any donations made to Stellar’s Lumenthropy website will be divided equally amongst the organizations. Stellar has also donated 100,000 XLM (about $4,200 USD) to each of the six organizations in addition to its matching campaign.

Decrypt recently explored how increased cryptocurrency support will affect charities, with crypto donations reportedly totaling hundreds of millions of dollars over the past few years."
2020-04-06,"In the recent market turmoil, bitcoin (BTC) did not act like the uncorrelated asset many thought it was. Nor did gold.

As things calmed down a bit (or as we got used to the new volatility), gold resumed its upward climb. But there are problems. It turns out that gold is not as fungible as we assumed.

Surging demand combined with refinery closures and shipping restrictions has created a shortage of gold coins and the small gold bars most popular with retail investors. And if you do manage to source one, you’ll pay a premium to the spot price.

According to Bloomberg, spot gold traded at $1,580/oz on Wednesday, while gold coins sold for $1,786/oz and 1oz gold bars for $1,729/oz.

Gold bars and coins normally sell at a premium to spot, but the premium is apparently now more than twice its usual level in some formats, and many dealers have a waitlist. Even the kilobar, a heavier lift (geddit?) for retail investors than the smaller coins and 1oz bars, is at a much higher markup than usual.

Even larger denominations used for futures settlement are experiencing supply issues. Unusually, the London Bullion Market Authority (LBMA) and COMEX, associations based in London and New York, respectively, that jointly establish the global gold price through the trading of unallocated gold- and cash-settled futures, this week put out a joint statement reassuring the market of their gold stocks. Yet, stories have surfaced of COMEX not being able to settle some of its futures contracts with the standard 100oz gold bar and needing to import 400oz gold bars from London. Last week, the CME Group (parent of COMEX) announced a new gold futures contract with settlement in either 100-ounce, 400-ounce or 1-kilo bars. Yet according to BullionStar, as of Friday there were no 400oz gold bars in New York. There’s so much going on here that we could write a book, but for now it’s worth keeping an eye open for disruption in physical settlement of gold futures. It’s also worth remembering that the bitcoin market may have its problems, but actual delivery is not one of them.

Quarterly figures

The end of the first quarter of 2020 this week gives us some nice packaging to wrap around relative performance figures, and an opportunity to look at where the market might go from here.

BTC’s fall was part of a broad market rout, with sharp falls in most traditional asset classes.

As the above chart hints, BTC’s correlation to equities rose sharply, while its correlation to gold fell.

On a longer time frame, however, the BTC/Gold relationship is stronger than that of bitcoin and equities, and we expect this to become the norm again as markets settle into a new outlook.

Half gone

Unless you’ve been living under a rock recently (which would be forgivable given what’s going on), you’ll have heard of the bitcoin “halving” (or “halvening”). If you’re familiar with bitcoin technology, you’ll know what it is; if you’re not, well, buckle up.

The halving is a fascinating insight into how decentralized incentives can maintain a system of programmatic monetary policy with a hard cap. For a quick introduction, here’s our explainer (with video!). If you want more detail, over 30 charts and some in-depth miner commentary, as well as a look at what the impact on the price could be, download our free report.

Inside, you’ll see how bitcoin’s technology and its market have an intertwined relationship unlike any other asset class. Its value stems from the resilience of its protocol, which no single entity controls. In the increasingly fragile fiat system, with rules that change according to convenience, this will attract attention even if just for intellectual curiosity. The halving will hone that attention, as it highlights just how novel bitcoin’s technology is. What’s more, it is happening at a time when fiat currency supply breaks all bounds of control. The juxtaposition is stark, and raises important questions about what constitutes value and how much we should sacrifice fundamentals for convenience. While bitcoin’s previous two halvings preceded a strong price rally, we can’t count on this one having the same effect. The bitcoin market is markedly different than it was four years ago, with a different level of institutional involvement, a more sophisticated market structure and a greater relevance in macro trends. The reduction of selling pressure from a lesser flow of new supply may play a part, as might the narrative around the halving and the extra mainstream attention it brings.

Narratives shape sentiment which influences prices, although investors may prefer to wait for fundamentals to become more clear. But if ever there was a time when it was appropriate to focus investor attention on an alternative supply mechanism for a potential store of value, for whatever reason, it is now.

Chain links

Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world in terms of volume, has bought CoinMarketCap, the most popular crypto data site in the sector, in terms of traffic. TAKEAWAY: In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao gave the data site’s large number of users as one of the main drivers of the deal. This hints at a renewed push into the retail crypto investment market, and a possible consolidation in the crypto market sector, with exchanges buying ancillary businesses to broaden their service and reach. It remains to be seen how this changes both CoinMarketCap’s and Binance’s offering and target market – and whether other exchanges follow suit with similar acquisitions.

Binance was also in the news for delisting leveraged tokens issued by derivatives platform FTX, which replicated a long or short position with 3x leverage. TAKEAWAY: The reason Binance gave is that users weren’t reading the small print and didn’t seem to realize that these instruments could lose them a lot of money if not handled correctly. On the other hand, FTX, in which Binance has an undisclosed stake, has not experienced similar issues. This could be because of Binance’s heavily retail user base, while FTX users are probably more sophisticated. Either way, this is an interested example of self-regulation – these tokens were profitable for the exchange in that they generated a significant amount of volume, but, you know, “protecting users comes first.”

Options market data shows a 4 percent chance of bitcoin hitting all-time highs this year, and a 16% chance of ending the year above $10,000. TAKEAWAY: Call and put spreads can be used to calculate the market’s expectations of prices at expiry, but, like all prices, they react to information and are likely to continue to move up or down as expiries near and as traditional market directions become more clear.

As interest rates drop to zero, how will stablecoin issuers cover their costs? TAKEAWAY: Dollar-backed stablecoin issuers have been making a tidy profit on the interest they earn on the deposited dollars. If that gets totally taken off the table, will they resort to raising fees? Will that impact stablecoin demand, which has been rising as more investors park excess cash in stablecoins rather than fiat currency?

Cryptocurrency exchange data firm Kaiko broke down the March 12-13 bitcoin price movements to highlight the role of liquidity in volatility. TAKEAWAY: Analyses like these help to understand the role of market depth (size of bid and ask orders) in volatility – if bids and asks can be just wiped off the board in a sharp price movement, the movement will become even sharper in the absence of support levels. On March 12-13, market depth got decimated and spreads widened significantly, which exacerbated the price slippage, volatility and sharp decline.

Analytics firm Glassnode highlights metrics that show bitcoin network activity is recovering after the crash. TAKEAWAY: I love network metrics – to think that we can get an almost-real-time look at what is actually happening under an asset’s hood in terms of movement, accumulation and adoption… The increase of active addresses and number of small transactions suggests that panic is subsiding. And a historical comparison of more esoteric metrics such as net unrealized profit (NUPL) and market value vs realized value (MVRV) hint that the bitcoin price has reached a bottom.

Coinbase points the finger at leverage in the crypto sector as the main culprit of the March 12 crash. TAKEAWAY: I agree – many accounts claimed that it was due to a fire-sale of any liquid asset to raise liquidity for margin calls elsewhere. While there may have been some of that, we haven’t seen much evidence. And if it were the case, it would imply a much greater crypto presence than we had realized of large institutional investors. Also, it does not make intuitive sense that institutions would exit a highly volatile asset on the way down, knowing it would be difficult to get back in at a similar price, unless they really had no other more liquid and less volatile assets in their portfolio – an unlikely scenario. Leverage in bitcoin derivatives is relatively steep, especially on the larger exchanges, which leaves traders more vulnerable to margin calls than in other assets. And the sharp drop in open interest shows how much the crash affected the leveraged derivatives market.

After the rout of mid-March, several exchanges have reported a sharp uptick in new user signups. Kraken, for instance, saw an 83% increase in signups, Luno had 50% more active users, and peer-to-peer crypto exchange Paxful doubled its signup rate. TAKEAWAY: Is this a sign of people wanting to hedge against the fragility of the fiat system? Or is it a sign of lockdown boredom, in which anything with sanitary risk holds appeal?

Amid market turmoil and talk in traditional markets of circuit breakers, short-selling bans and even total market shutdowns, there have been some mutterings about applying similar measures to crypto markets. TAKEAWAY: They will forever be just mutterings, though – crypto markets can’t close, no matter what, and that’s a good thing.","Crypto markets are recovering strongly today as total capitalization surges above US$200 billion [$AU325 billion] for the first time since the big crash last month. Ethereum is in the driving seat with a 20% surge, but what has caused the big push?

Over the past 24 hours, almost $20 billion has entered the cryptocurrency space as market cap surged to $210 billion.

It is the highest they have been since March 12 when Bitcoin dumped 50% and the rest of the digital lemmings followed.

Ethereum has been in the driving seat for this recovery with an epic pump of almost 20% from $145 to top out over $170 a few hours ago.

Yet again, ETH has led a market revival as its big brother only managed to gain 7% over the same period. Nonetheless, Bitcoin is now above crucial resistance as it taps $7,300.

Ethereum has managed to recover over 60% since its dump to $105 during the big market crash last month.

At these prices, it was seen to be massively undervalued still over 90% down from its peak over two years ago.

Even at current levels, ETH prices are almost 88% down, so further buying pressure could materialize as DeFi markets also start to recover.","A flood of class-action lawsuits were filed in New York Friday, taking aim at a number of major cryptocurrency projects.

First reported by Offshore Alert, at least 10 complaints were filed in the Southern District of New York on April 3, alleging the firms had sold crypto tokens to U.S. investors that were in fact unregistered securities.

Among those targeted in the suits are cryptocurrency exchanges Binance (see complaint) and BitMEX operator HDR Global Trading, as well as notable blockchain projects like Tron (see complaint), Civic, Block.One, Kyber Network and Status. Bibox, Quantstamp, Bancor and Kucoin are also named in individual complaints.

The actions, which also name executives from the firms including Binance’s CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and Civic’s Vinny Lingham, were brought by “litigation boutique” Roche Cyrulnik Freedman on behalf of the plaintiffs. The law firm is also currently representing the Kleiman estate in a lawsuit against Craig Wright over a trove of bitcoin worth billions.

The complaint against Binance states:

""Binance and the Issuers wrongfully engaged in millions of transactions—including the solicitation, offer, and sale of securities—without registering the Tokens as securities, and without Binance registering with the SEC as an exchange or broker-dealer. As a result, investors were not informed of the significant risks inherent in these investments, as federal and state securities laws require.""

The suits have been brought on behalf of several individuals, including Chase Williams, Alexander Clifford and Eric Lee, as well as William Zhang in the case of Civic. As class actions, they are also brought “on behalf of all others similarly situated.”

In making their case, the plaintiffs raise the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s action against EOS maker Block.One over its over $4 billion ICO in 2018. The firm agreed to pay penalties of $24 million for conducting an unregistered securities sale in September of last year.

The plaintiffs draw comparison between tokens issued by the companies accused in the complaints and Block.One’s sale of EOS.

The Binance filing states:

""The creation of EOS tokens thus occurred through a centralized process, in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum. This would not have been apparent at issuance, however, to a reasonable investor. Rather, it was only after the passage of time and disclosure of additional information about the issuer’s intent, process of management, and success in allowing decentralization to arise that a reasonable purchaser could know that he or she had acquired a security.""

Other filings make similar claims of similarities between Block.One’s ICO and tokens issued by defendants.

The reason the lawsuits have been brought en masse may be due to the statute of limitations in the U.S., which rules that a case over fraud must be brought within two years from a crime being discovered.

Fintech attorney Richard B. Levin told Decrypt that the complaints are likely to go to trial.","“It’s exactly why bitcoin (BTC) was created,” Michael Novogratz, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Galaxy Digital, told CNBC last week.

It’s a common refrain heard these days from bitcoin bulls: The U.S. dollar and other currencies will eventually be debased by the injections of trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related aid and monetary stimulus by governments and central banks. That should, theoretically, strengthen the case for bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, as a hedge against inflation.

Such predictions might eventually come true, but for now bitcoin investors are stuck in a holding pattern: The cryptocurrency pushed above $7,000 on Monday, but for the past couple weeks it has struggled to hold that level, which it hasn’t reliably traded above since early March.

“A nice recovery from the lows leaves investors hopeful,” cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Friday in a report. “However, this is not yet reflected in the market sentiment.”

Any inflation stemming from fiscal and monetary stimulus could take a while to appear – partly because of higher unemployment and a drop-off in economic demand could relieve upward pressure on consumer prices in the near term. In the U.S. alone, roughly 10 million new unemployment claims were filed during the last two full weeks of March, and JPMorgan economists predict that a report this week will reveal another seven million claims were filed last week. Bank of America says the lack of an effective policy response to control the spread of the virus will push 2020 global growth to a contraction of 2.7 percent, instead of an expansion of 0.3 percent.

Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and co-founder of the blockchain analytics startup CoinMetrics, wrote last week for CoinDesk that the devaluation of money “does not happen immediately, but over time.”

The 2008 financial crisis prompted the Federal Reserve to double total assets in a matter of weeks, and then doubled the size of the balance sheet again to more than $4 trillion over the next few years. But it took the money supply, as measured by M2, more than 12 years to double, at least partly because of low demand for loans in the years after the crisis.

The bitcoin market’s tepid reaction thus far to the Federal Reserve’s announcement of essentially unbounded quantitative easing might disappoint some bitcoiners who are looking for a faster pump.

Sylvain Saurel, author of the blog In Bitcoin We Trust, wrote last week that a separate move by U.S. regulators to reduce bank reserve requirements could lead to new money creation “ad infinitum.”

“This unprecedented currency devaluation in such a short period of time has been decided by the Federal Reserve in a totally arbitrary manner,” Saurel wrote. His conclusion, essentially, was that people should buy bitcoin.

Jay Hao, CEO of the Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, wrote last week in a blog post that “more proactive measures” would be needed beyond “QE infinity.” Those could include a new “super-sovereign currency” to address trade and economic imbalances created by the U.S. dollar’s dominant role in global finance.

“At present, bitcoin possesses the characteristics of a super-sovereign currency,” Hao wrote.

The investment narrative that bitcoin is a “harder” currency than U.S. dollars and is getting additional traction from next month’s “halving” on the bitcoin blockchain – the once-every-four-years occurrence by which the pace of issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency gets cut in half.

Traders are expected to get a chance this week to observe how prices of two bitcoin-offshoot cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), perform as they go through their own quadrennial halvings.

Some analysts said last month that bitcoin was trading in sync with U.S. stocks. That was seen as a sign that some investors were selling the cryptocurrency as part of an indiscriminate flight to safety – into dollars.

Olga Feldmeier, CEO of the digital-asset exchange Smart Valor and a self-described “outright bitcoin maximalist,” says bitcoin’s price plunge earlier this year undercuts hopes that the cryptocurrency would serve as a safe-haven asset in times of market turmoil. She instead recommended “tokenized gold” – digital tokens like the Pax Gold (PAXG) – that offer a crypto-friendly way of investing in the yellow metal, long seen as a reliable inflation hedge.

Kraken, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange, noted in an April 4 blog post that the volume of PAXG trading on its platform surged to $13 million in March, a six-fold increase from February levels.

“Kraken clients appear to see PAXG as a safe haven of late since it is backed by gold, which typically acts as a safe haven amidst economic uncertainty,” according to the post.

But there are some indications that bitcoin might be trading more like gold in recent weeks. VanEck, a money-management firm that offers a bitcoin trust to qualified institutional buyers, says bitcoin’s price correlation with gold jumped to 0.47 during the last couple weeks of March, from an average 0.03 over the past eight years. (A correlation of 1 implies perfect synchronicity.)

The next couple months could prove pivotal for bitcoin as the U.S. suffers the worst stretch of the pandemic’s health crisis and moves into the economic-recovery phase. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, told CNBC last week the recently passed $2 trillion aid package would not be enough. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would ask Congress for more money if a $350 billion pool for small businesses runs out.

“More bazookas needed,” executives for the Wall Street dealer Jefferies wrote Friday in an open letter to clients and colleagues.

Is bitcoin the real digital gold? With more financial “bazookas” getting hoisted into position, cryptocurrency markets will serve as the proving ground.

“Many Bitcoin advocates think it will prove to be a better long-term store of value than gold,” according to the Kraken blog post. “Only time will tell.”

BITCOIN WATCH

Via Trading View

Bitcoin is again looking to establish a strong foothold above $7,000, having tested dip demand with a pullback to $6,600 over the weekend. The cryptocurrency printed a high above $7,100 early Monday and is currently changing hands around $7,090.

The bulls have repeatedly failed to keep gains above the $7,000 mark over the last three weeks, forcing investors to question the sustainability of recovery rally from the March 19 low of $3,867.

Even so, the bias remains bullish, as a pennant breakout confirmed April 2 is still intact. As a result, the cryptocurrency remains on the hunt for a test of the descending 50-day average, currently at $7,522.

If the upside break of $7,000 resistance again proves to be short-lived, the immediate bullish outlook would be neutralized. The bias would turn bearish if prices fall below support at the weekend low of $6,610.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Math prodigy Vitalik Buterin had his first encounter with cryptocurrencies back in 2011, but didn’t get involved with the space until 2012.

After reconsidering the merits of decentralization and Bitcoin, Buterin threw himself wholeheartedly into supporting the emerging industry.

Despite initial uncertainty and conflicts with other founders, Buterin went on to head Ethereum.

A man that has become almost synonymous with Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin is one of a handful of people that have been responsible for taking the crypto industry from niche forums and bringing it into the mainstream. We take a look at the often-cryptic figure behind the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency.

Early Life and Bitcoin Beginnings

Now one of the pillars of a burgeoning industry, it’s hard to imagine what the crypto space would look like weren’t it for Vitalik Buterin.

Sometimes controversial, Buterin’s work within the Ethereum community and beyond is well worth knowing.

Born in the Russian city of Kolomna in 1994, Buterin is the son of a talented computer scientist Dmitri Buterin who took his family to Canada in 2000 in search of better employment. Once settled in Toronto, Buterin was quickly moved into a program for gifted children in his elementary school. This, he told a Wired reported back in 2016, had a profound impact on him.

“I remember knowing, for a while, for a long time, that I was kind of abnormal in some sense,” he said.

It wasn’t that his Russian roots made it hard for him to assimilate—Bitalik Buterin thrived at school, describing his time at the Abelard private school as the most interesting and productive years of his life. It was Buterin’s natural proclivity for mathematics and programming that made him stand out from the crowd.

He first learned about Bitcoin from his father in 2011, but said that he dismissed the idea of cryptocurrencies as they had no intrinsic value. However, once he came across Bitcoin the second time, the idea of a decentralized currency perfectly aligned with what he called “a dualistic worldview.”

The promise of putting control back in the hands of “the little guy” pushed Buterin to research Bitcoin even further, an effort that led him to become a contributing author on Bitcoin blogs. Each post earned him five BTC—a huge feat for a 17-year-old with not enough money or computing power to mine the new currency.

His articles caught the eye of Mihai Alisie, a Romanian Bitcoin enthusiast, who began an online correspondence that would later lead to the creation of Ethereum. In late 2011, when Bitalik Buterin was 17 and Alisie was 24, they co-founded Bitcoin Magazine, the first publication focusing solely on the crypto industry.

How Ethereum Came to Be

Looking back, it’s easy to spot the turning point of both his private and professional life.

In May 2013, Buterin attended a Bitcoin conference in San Jose, California as a representative of Bitcoin Magazine.

Seeing such a huge number of people flocking around the same idea—that money and data could be decentralized—was enough to push him deeper into the crypto industry.

“That moment really crystallized it for me,” he told Wired. “It really convinced me that, hey, this thing’s real and it’s worth taking a risk and jumping into. So I did.”

Just weeks later, he dropped out of Waterloo College where he was studying computer science and began traveling to meet with other like-minded individuals that were keeping the industry alive. As it turned out, Buterin belonged to a group of people who saw that Bitcoin’s underlying technology could be used for much more than just recording transactions.

Shortly after Bitcoin began trading, people realized that a peer-to-peer network could be used to facilitate complex agreements between two parties and host applications built upon its code. However, most projects focusing on building blockchain 2.0, as it was often called then, were trying to add these functions on top of Bitcoin.

Buterin came up with the idea to write a completely new version of Bitcoin that came with a Turing-complete programming language. This way, the network could support an almost unlimited number of digital services straight out of the box.

He sketched out a whitepaper for his proposed network called Ethereum in November 2013 and sent it to 15 of his friends.

“When I came up with Ethereum, my first first thought was, okay this thing is too good to be true and I’m going to have five professional cryptographers raining down on me and telling me how stupid I am for not seeing a bunch of very obvious flaws,” he said.

Within two weeks, 30 people reached out to him to talk the idea over. Stephan Tual, a crypto enthusiast, Anthony Di Iorio, an entrepreneur, Joseph Lubin, an early Bitcoin investor, Gavin Wood, a programmer, and Charles Hoskinson, who would go on to create Cardano, were among the first to gather around Ethereum.

The small group would see its numbers drastically increase following the 2014 Bitcoin Miami conference, where Buterin first revealed Ethereum to the public. His speech was followed by a standing ovation and hundreds of investors and enthusiasts lining up to talk to him.

This, the Financial Post noted in a profile, cemented his status as the prophet of cryptocurrency’s next big thing.

However, building a project as ambitious as Ethereum would require a lot of money. To ensure they’d avoid attracting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the group of founders decided to hold an initial coin offering (ICO).

The crowdsale of Ether tokens raised more than 31,000 Bitcoins, worth around $18 million at the time.

While the team lost an exorbitant amount of money once Bitcoin’s price plummeted a few months after the crowdsale, the events cemented Buterin’s belief that Ethereum should be a non-profit organization.

This didn’t bode well with some of the other founders, mainly Di Iorio and Hoskinson, who both left the company in 2014 after a dramatic founders’ meeting in Switzerland.

Who Calls the Shots in a Decentralized Network?

A staunch libertarian, Vitalik Buterin believes that the future of Ethereum lies in complete decentralization.

But, while he frequently asserts that Ethereum is not a for-profit entity and that its purpose is to facilitate a decentralized network, that’s not exactly the case in reality.

Following the dispute with other Ethereum founders, Buterin said that he realized that the fate of the project rested solely on his shoulders. “I realized I was the one who had the ability to make a decision,” he said. “I really felt like, ‘Oh my God, a lot of this is actually on me.’”

Whether he likes it or not, Buterin’s face and name are intrinsically woven into Ethereum. Exemplary of this was a 4Chan post which read, “Vitalik Buterin confirmed dead. Insiders unloading ETH.” Although false, Ether’s price tanked by more than 23% in a matter of minutes.

Any statements he makes regarding Ethereum or other projects running on it have the power to sway the market each way. In many ways, however, he has embraced this power.

Back in 2016, the then 22-year-old said that the powerful “have too much power.”

“I think a large part of the consequence is necessarily going to be disempowering some of these centralized players to some extent,” he said. “Because ultimately power is a zero sum game.”

Buterin’s extremely libertarian worldview seems to have mellowed through the years, as in 2018, he supported the creation of The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA).

The coalition consisted of more than two dozen major financial and technology companies, including JP Morgan, the CME Group, Intel, and Microsoft, that joined forces to create an enterprise-friendly Ethereum solution.

Vitalik Buterin, however, believes that servicing the needs of corporations doesn’t interfere with Ethereum’s primary benefit, which is to provide regular people with access to a broader financial market.","As the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) is highly volatile, once surging from $1,000 to $20,000 in the span of just over a year. The coin has become the subject of infinite price predictions. Both optimistic and negative, some of these predictions have turned out to be extremely inaccurate.

Vitalik Buterin, the well-known co-creator of the Ethereum network and its native cryptocurrency Ether (ETH), highlighted the two worst Bitcoin price predictions ever made since the digital currency was introduced back in 2009.

In an April 6 tweet, Buterin emphasized that price predictions on crypto markets are “notorious for turning out very wrong” — both on the bull and bear side.

Famous 2020 $1 million prediction

According to the Ethereum co-founder, the worst bullish Bitcoin prediction was made by John McAfee, founder of major software firm McAfee and a former 2020 United States presidential candidate. Specifically, Buterin referred to a McAfee’s famous $1 million Bitcoin proclamation delivered in November 2017, at the time when Bitcoin was approaching its all-time high of $20,000.

The cybersecurity veteran predicted back in 2017:

“When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bitcoin at $1 mln by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong.”

After holding his prediction for years, McAfee eventually retracted the “legendary” $1 million prediction in January 2020, claiming that the prediction was just a “ruse to onboard new users.” Subsequently, McAfee also argued that Bitcoin is not the future of crypto, ultimately calling the cryptocurrency “worthless” last week.

Bearish side

As the most inaccurate bearish Bitcoin prediction, Buterin picked a forecast from prominent American economist and famous cryptocurrency critic, Nouriel Roubini. Back in February 2018, when Bitcoin was hitting new multi-month lows by collapsing to below $7,000 from $20,000, Roubini argued that Bitcoin was on his way to zero. He tweeted:

“As expected Bitcoin now crashes below $6,000. Now the $5K handle is reached. And the US Congressional Hearing on Crypto-Scams is still a day away. HODL nuts will hold their melting Bitcoins all the way down to ZERO while scammers and whales dump and run…”

In October 2018, Roubini also argued that 99% of cryptocurrencies are worth nothing. The famous Bitcoin critic also apparently still believes that cryptocurrency has “absolutely no basis for success” as a technology.

Buterin bets on decentralization and privacy

By outlining these two failed Bitcoin predictions, Buterin highlighted the question of responsibility among those who have a high degree of influence. The Ethereum co-founder urged people not to forget that everyone makes mistakes and called for social incentives for saying “sane” things. Buterin tweeted:

“This is why I think digging up over-confident predictions people made 2-5 years ago that turned out horribly wrong and laughing at them is a great custom to have. We need at least social incentive to say things that are sane, and we need to be reminded of everyone's fallibility.”

Buterin himself appears to have made no certain crypto price predictions so far. At the same time, the developer is known for his bullish stance toward the future of decentralization. As Cointelegraph reported in March 2020, Buterin is confident that the currency of the future will be decentralized and private, as such money would be more resilient against “centralized chokepoints.”","The new – and now often-cited – connection between bitcoin (BTC) and global equities doesn’t just mean they fall together.

Sometimes, it means they rally on potentially good news. And that seems to be the case on Monday, as positive data on the war on the coronavirus offer hope to the markets that better days may come soon.

The price of bitcoin is at $7,145 as of 13:45 UTC (8:45 a.m. Eastern time), a 5 percent gain from the previous 24 hours. The move began during Asian equity market trading hours as Japan’s Nikkei index moved up 4.2 percent. Futures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average also had some sunshine around then, indicating a more than 700-point gain when New York traders heard their opening bell.

Part of that optimism in stock markets and in cryptocurrencies stems from a few glimmers of hope on the coronavirus front.

“Looks like we’re piggybacking on equities with some data possibly indicating virus peaking coming out of a few of the European countries,” said Dave Vizsolyi, head of trading at Chicago-based proprietary crypto trading firm DV Chain.

To be sure, cryptocurrency markets often gyrate with little rhyme or reason, and an original selling point of bitcoin was as a non-correlated asset, indifferent to movements in traditional markets. However, during the recent crisis, the bellwether digital asset has tended to track the incumbents.

Signs of progress

Daily new cases are slowing in places like Italy, where they have stayed in the 4,000 range since March 30; at its peak on March 21, over 6,500 new cases were reported. New York, the hardest-hit state in the U.S., saw a slight drop in coronavirus-related deaths; 4,159 lives were lost in the Empire State so far, but Sunday saw the first daily drop in fatalities since the crisis began.

That’s not to say the week promises to be easy on the United

States, where there are more than 300,000 cases, a quarter of the world’s total.

“This is going to be the hardest and saddest week of most

Americans’ lives,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams said

on Fox News over the weekend. “This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment,

our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized. It’s going to be

happening all over the country.”

However, his commander-in-chief, President Donald Trump, took a more glass-half-full approach, proclaiming in all-caps “LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL” on his preferred method of communication, Twitter.

Grim picture

Nonetheless, some in the crypto markets aren’t sold on the idea that the worst is behind us.

Paxos exchange CEO Chad Cascarilla warned of a grim picture on Patrick O’Shaughnessy’s podcast, “Invest Like the Best,” if fiscal and monetary stimulus prove too little, too late.

Cascarilla sees about a 25 percent chance the U.S. would need a bank holiday similar to what happened in the Great Depression and even some nationalization in its financial sector.","South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Commission, the nation’s financial watchdog, has deemed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be a “high-risk asset” — a ruling that could severely dampen the nascent decentralized finance industry in the country, but not necessarily kill it.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an industry that attempts to replace the usual functions of the traditional banking and finance sector with alternatives powered by blockchain technology. Just as the traditional financial sector offers a plethora of different products, DeFi is also varied with firms trying to disrupt all parts of the stack. With this has come a burgeoning credit industry, where people can receive a loan in fiat currency while posting bitcoin or other cryptocurrency as collateral. The platform crowdfunds their pool of fiat capital from investors, much like any P2P lending platform. Arguably, this has become the largest segment of the industry for the simple reason that it offers a tax-efficient, or even tax-free way to cash out bitcoin and other crypto in exchange for fiat currency.

When an individual sells their holdings in bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, it’s considered a taxable event. In most jurisdictions, save for a few, this would create capital gains for the trader and lead to a potential hefty tax bill come the end of the tax year. In the United States, the IRS considers every crypto trade to be a taxable event regardless whether an off-ramp to fiat is involved. However, in many jurisdictions, loans aren’t taxable. If a trader wants to sell bitcoin to buy an alternative investment, they can get a loan against part of their crypto portfolio to buy into that investment instead of cashing out (taxable) and buying back in.

The other inherent issue is the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. These balance sheets of these services would have assets denominated in fiat currency, which might have fluctuations in the single digits every month, but liabilities in bitcoin and other crypto, which are notorious for their violent price swings that sometimes can go up or down in the double digits on the same day. It’s very likely that the platform could be in a situation where its balance sheet fiat currency debt is worth far more than its assets, which would mean that investors lose out.

Forcing the government’s hand

This isn’t the end of the DeFi industry within Korea. The ruling, which would take effect on August 27 this year, would affect only a certain segment of it — the credit industry — and for perhaps good reason. Authorities are concerned about the crypto loan sector because of its ability to be used as a tool of tax evasion as well as a risk to retail investors.

South Korean regulators have ruled that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are “high risk assets”. Photo: Rawpixel.com

However, this will won’t be the end of the DeFi credit industry in Korea. The new law would affect only firms that have a fiat off-ramp. MakerDAO, for instance, uses crypto collateral only to lend out more crypto and would not fall under this ruling.

Local stakeholders tend to agree. Andi Ji, the co-founder of the Ontology Network, an enterprise-focused blockchain project working closely with the open-source platform Neo, praised Korean authorities for taking swift action and said that moves like this would push blockchain technology and cryptocurrency trading closer to the mainstream.

“Regulators are needed if we are to clamp down on illicit activity and this legislation will likely set the wheels in motion for several changes to occur in the future,” Ji told Forkast.News. “From a local government perspective, this framework will help encourage more regulatory-friendly policies to be made in favor of the safe trading of crypto assets. For the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), exchanges may attempt to consolidate by raising funds or going global in the long term.”

Of course, there’s also the nature of geography and corporate domiciles. If the Korean DeFi industry insists on continuing to loan out fiat currency backed by crypto such as bitcoin, it could simply move its country of incorporation to a flag of convenience where such enterprises are not prohibited.

Recall that China has a strongly enforced blanket ban on exchanges that buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. Yet exchanges like OKEx and Huobi — which largely employ Chinese nationals, have a sizable office in China and target Chinese nationals for their respective user base — operate without prohibition simply because the corporations are domiciled elsewhere. OKEx continues to do business in China because it is headquartered in Malta and not technically a company within China’s legal jurisdiction. Same for Huobi, which is headquartered in Singapore.

Just don’t be surprised if there will soon be Singaporean, Maltease or other national flags adorning corporate documents out of the DeFi community in South Korea. If anyone was to ask, Huobi calls the Lion City and OKEx calls a small archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea home. Not China. The same could happen to companies anywhere else in the world, including South Korea.",
2020-04-07,"UPDATE (April 8, 14:45 UTC): The bitcoin cash halving took place at 12:20 UTC Wednesday, full story here.

Bitcoin cash (BCH), the cryptocurrency that broke off from bitcoin (BTC) due to a heated community disagreement in 2017, is about to hit a blockchain milestone.

At block 630,000, expected to occur Wednesday morning Eastern time, the number of BCH coins created roughly every 10 minutes will fall by half, from 12.5 to 6.25. This will be the first halving for BCH in a sort of spectator sport some on Reddit say they will be watching as it unfolds on the blockchain.

The event is a foreshadowing of the same process happening on a larger scale on the BTC blockchain next month. BCH’s market cap is worth about a twenty-fifth of BTC’s.

And if that’s not enough halvings for you, bitcoin SV (BSV), the cryptocurrency that forked off from BCH after another bitter battle, will be halving just a day or so later.

The halving is seen as monumental since it highlights that the supply of the coin is fixed, a characteristic that differentiates BTC and its doppelgangers from most national currencies. Plus, it is arguably an important variable that led to bitcoin price increases in the past.

As such, one Reddit user said they bought beers to “celebrate [the event] with family.”

The halving is happening earlier in the year for BCH and BSV partly because BCH temporarily had a different algorithm dictating how quickly the mining difficulty would adjust, which for a time sped up the block creation process.

Chance of attack

This slightly earlier date might have an unintended consequence.

BSV developer Brad Jasper said that in the short term this week’s halvings will be “bad” for the respective cryptocurrencies.

He expects miners to temporarily leave for greener pastures. The main source of income for miners is the block rewards, which the halving will suddenly cut in half, making the chains less lucrative to mine. Meanwhile, BTC’s block rewards don’t halve for another month or so.

“When BSV/BCH halve, they will both lose hash power, likely to BTC,” Jasper said. In the long term, he argued, BSV will prevail due to its “utility” as a network that prioritizes transaction growth.

Norway-based Arcane Research agreed with the part about the loss of computing power in a report released last week, but went further. If hash power declines, Arcane said, the two splinter cryptocurrencies will be more vulnerable to 51 percent attacks, in which malicious actors gain control of the network.

But Jasper said he expects the situation will quickly change once BTC takes its turn and halves next month, since it will no longer be more profitable to mine than its namesake progeny.

That said, not everyone is convinced the halving milestone will lead to anything exciting or out of the ordinary.

Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, known in the early days as “Bitcoin Jesus” for his evangelism before defecting to the BCH camp, said BCH’s halving will be a “non-event” given BTC’s halving history.","The bitcoin block reward halving – a hotly-anticipated event during which the amount of BTC produced with each new transaction block will fall from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC – is expected to occur next month.

The event takes place roughly every four years and is intended to ensure the scarcity of bitcoin, with the total planned supply of bitcoin fixed at 21 million coins.

The Block reached out to top crypto exchanges for their perspectives on the halving. According to those we heard from, one expected outcome is the arrival of new market participants.

""Historically, we have seen a price surge in the 1.5 years after the halving, so it's highly possible we'll see new entrants in the market,"" Dave Ripley, chief operating officer at Kraken, told The Block.

Paxful co-founder and CEO Ray Youssef echoed Ripley's thoughts, saying that there has been an ""unprecedented surge in demand and price in the aftermath of the past two halvings. Though it would be hard to say, of course, if the past patterns will hold true, [it will bring new users in the market].""

In the two previous halvings – November 2012 and July 2016 – the bitcoin price increased over 8,000% and 600%, respectively, within the one-year period, according to data from CoinMetrics complied by The Block Research.

Crypto exchange Gemini also said that ""we do expect more people will look at bitcoin, and recognize the halving event as a stark — and compelling — juxtaposition to the quantitative easing policies being favored by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks.""

OKEx's director of financial markets, Lennix Lai, on the other hand, said bitcoin halving could be understood as ""quantitative tightening"" on crypto.

""We expect the competition among miners would be getting intense. Whilst the most efficient miners shall prevail, we believe there would be a surge in demand for miner-oriented financial products which would assist miners to manage their price risk and expected cash outflow,"" said Lai.



Non-custodial crypto exchange KyberSwap's head of products Sunny Jain said the halving could result in an overall increase in demand for bitcoin, which will likely result in increased volumes for bitcoin-pegged tokens such as WrappedBTC.

Other exchanges said bitcoin halving could be a non-event if the coronavirus pandemic situation continues. The halving event is ""likely to be overshadowed,"" Bitstamp told The Block, though it will ""certainly influence"" the market over the long-term.","Both bitcoin and the U.S. stock markets have witnessed a notable recovery rally over the past couple of weeks, but it’s the cryptocurrency that’s taken the lead.

Bitcoin (BTC) clocked a 3.5-week high of $7,459 early on Tuesday, meaning the cryptocurrency was up 4.2 percent from the yearly opening price of $7,160. Since then prices have fallen back slightly, putting the year-to-date gain at around 3.2 percent.

Meanwhile, the U.S. stock markets are still trading in the red on a YTD basis. The S&P 500, Wall Street’s equity index, has pulled off a strong 21.5 percent rally from lows near $2,190 reached on March 23, but even so it’s still down 17.5 percent for the year.

Gold, a classic haven asset, has gained around 2 percent so far since Jan. 1.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $7,445 – up around 90 percent from the low of $3,867 observed on March 13, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

As bitcoin looks to be moving in tandem with the equity markets, what’s behind bitcoin’s outperformance of the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis?

Rally fueled by crypto investors

Bitcoin may be gaining altitude because the market is now dominated by long-term investors who believe in the narrative that the cryptocurrency is a hedge against global economic duress brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

Bitcoin’s rapid drop from $8,000 to $3,867 seen on March 12 and March 13 was mainly fueled by long liquidations by institutions and macro traders. “These non-crypto dedicated participants squared off their long positions to raise the cash needed to fund margin calls,” said Richard Rosenblum, co-head of trading at GSR.

“Following the liquidations, the market is primarily made up of crypto-native firms and long investors. Not surprisingly, bitcoin is acting more bullish,” Rosenblum said.

The coronavirus-led sell-off in the equity markets, triggered a global dash for cash, which saw macro traders sell everything from gold to bitcoin.

Derivatives market data does suggest institutions took a break from the crypto markets in March. Open interest, or open contracts, in futures listed on global exchanges fell from $4 billion on March 11 to $2 billion on March 14, according to data from research firm Skew.

The cryptocurrency is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and challenge the high of $8,000 seen just before the March 12 sell-off.

“Bitcoin is within shouting distance of its March meltdown level, and could make par by the weekend,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic told CoinDesk.

Chu, however, warned the cryptocurrency is still on uncertain ground and could slip back below $7,000. A pullback may be seen if key resistance near $7,480 proves a tough nut to crack.

Daily and 4-hour charts

Bitcoin charted a green marubozu candle on Monday (above left), which comprises a big body and small or no wicks. The candle indicates buyers were in control from the open to the close, reflecting strong bullish sentiment.

The pattern strengthened the case for a rally to $8,000 put forward by a pennant breakout confirmed last week.

So far, however, the buyers have failed to challenge the 50-day average hurdle at $7,482. Bitcoin narrowly missed passing the average resistance early on Tuesday, with prices dropping back from $7,459.

If the hurdle continues to cap upside during the U.S. trading hours, an overbought reading on the 4-hour chart relative strength index would gain credence, possibly yielding a drop to the daily chart rising channel support, currently at $6,810.","Peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange Paxful has added physical gold as a payment option, at a time when the yellow metal is in short supply.

The new feature allows Paxful users to buy bitcoin with gold, and sell bitcoin for gold.

“With the recent economic downturn, people still prefer gold as a safe investment, with some already reporting shortages of supply. In a way, it's even symbolic to trade the gold with virtual gold, aka bitcoin,” Paxful co-founder and CEO Ray Youssef told The Block.

Buying gold with bitcoin in the current situation can be understandable. But who will sell gold for bitcoin now? “There are areas in the world where gold is abundant, but bitcoin is scarce. So, people in these areas can now be part of the crypto economy too,” Youssef told The Block.

Paxful claims to be the only P2P marketplace that provides gold as a payment method. “We assessed the demand for buying and selling bitcoin with gold, and it's surprisingly high. So, adding gold was the next natural step for us,"" said Youssef.

Paxful is accepting ""any form"" of physical gold, Youssef told The Block, adding that the new service is available for clients across the world.

Bitcoin will remain in the Paxful escrow during a trade, and the physical delivery of gold must be completed within 21 days of completion of a transaction, said the exchange.

Notably, there are no minimum and maximum transaction limits for trading gold and bitcoin and vice versa. Still, users will be required to meet Paxful’s know-your-customer (KYC) verification requirements at certain thresholds, said Youssef.

Looking ahead, Paxful plans to add more “goods and services” as a payment method, said Youssef, without disclosing specific details.

Paxful currently already supports over 300 types of payment methods for purchasing bitcoin, including online wallets, bank transfer, mobile recharge, and cash in-person, among other options.","Experts are aligned in thinking the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is using a billion-dollar cryptocurrency war chest to bust sanctions.

The pieces of the puzzle are falling into place, said Priscilla Moriuchi, head of nation-state research at Recorded Future, regarding the Hermit Kingdom’s crypto-funded, trade-based, money-laundering networks. While the complete picture is still obscure, it appears North Korea is able to fund off the radar ship-to-ship transfers using freshly minted cryptocurrency it earns from exchange and ransomeware attacks, among other means.

Sanctions evasion

The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s $1.5 billion cryptocurrency war chest is likely used to evade import and export sanctions, experts agree. Evidence documenting this cross-border movement is still mounting, though one reliable way for the DPRK to circumvent sanctions involves ship-to-ship transfers, the process of moving cargo from one ship to another in the open sea rather than at a port. The nation’s increased crypto-jacking activity, or using malicious bots to surreptitiously mine cryptocurrencies mean that these also points in this direction, as “newly mined cryptocurrency can be used to facilitate sanctions-evasion activity,” a U.N. report reads.

China’s commitments

“The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) will undoubtedly further its research and development of the national digital currency with enhanced top-down design,” the bank said in at a high-level conference. The unequivocal language used indicates a firmer stance on the project than before.

Teddy Fusaro, chief operating officer at Bitwise Asset Management, argues China is winning the misinformation war. After reeling from a novel coronavirus outbreak, the regional superpower is now exercising soft power, and authoritarian means, to rewrite the outbreak narrative.

Core code

The privacy and scaling upgrade Schnorr/Taproot bitcoin code update is moving closer to its implementation. The update will allow for a number heretofore impossible projects, by bundling together several different proposed technologies. Alyssa Hertig, CoinDesk contributor, breaks down what these changes are and what they mean for bitcoin’s future.

Regulatory hurdles

Risk-averse German banks are unwilling to take on crypto firms as clients, despite regulation and guidance from the nation’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority. “There is no legal reason why banks wouldn’t offer bank accounts but they are hesitant because they don’t understand the business,” said Matthias Winter, partner at Eversheds Sutherland Germany, a firm working directly with German regulators on how the law should be enforced.

Alternatives are presenting themselves. Coinhouse, an exchange, has become the first crypto company to be registered with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF). The registration means Coinhouse now has a shot at getting banking services in France, which could give the firm cheaper services than the German bank it currently works with.

Helping hand

Helperbit, a blockchain-based disaster management platform, has raised approximately $31,800 in bitcoin donations to help defray the cost of building emergency medical centers in Italy. “We are happy to have turned the received donations into a tangible aid. We are excited to have received so much help from the bitcoin community,” said the president of the Colli Albani Committee, Bruno Pietrosanti.

Notch in the ether

Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, has recorded its biggest daily gain in over 20 days. Industry experts said the rise can likely be attributed to growing confidence in a planned system-wide upgrade known as Eth 2.0, slated for July 2020, which promises higher transaction throughput and a new security model under proof-of-stake (PoS).

Decoupling?

Up 3 percent, bitcoin left the S&P 500 behind in a year-to-date recovery. Bitcoin clocked a 3.5-week high of $7,459 early on Tuesday, meaning the cryptocurrency was up 4.2 percent from the yearly opening price of $7,160. Since then prices have fallen back slightly, though the cryptocurrency is still ahead of Wall Street’s equity index, which is still down 17.5 percent for the year, despite a notable rally.

Halving report

In May of 2020, bitcoin is expected to undergo its third “halving,” a programmed supply reduction that has in the past coincided with a strong run-up in the bitcoin price. In this paper, we explain what the bitcoin halving is, why it matters and why the market is so focused on this event.

In brief: Online learning platforms are seeing a huge surge of interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency courses.

Udemy has seen a quadrupling of demand for Bitcoin-based classes.

More people are turning to online education generally.

The number of people signing up for online Bitcoin and cryptocurrency learning courses has skyrocketed in the wake of COVID-19.

With the pandemic forcing a global trend of lockdown and quarantines, millions all over the world have sought refuge online. Daily routines are fractured, and many are left wondering how to fill their now-abundant time. As a consequence, online learning courses have soared in interest—and people want to learn about Bitcoin.

Popular online learning platform Udemy told Decrypt it saw a fourfold increase in demand for its Bitcoin and cryptocurrency courses in the past month alone.

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the largest to this day. Image: Shutterstock.

“What we see on the Udemy platform is that demand for Bitcoin/cryptocurrency-related courses has quadrupled in the past month,” a spokesperson said.

Coursera, a service that collates courses from universities worldwide, similarly saw a huge uptick in Bitcoin-based classes in the last four weeks, compared to that of the previous year.

""In March, we saw a 293% increase in the total number of enrollments on our platform and a 200% increase for Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin courses specifically,"" a Coursera spokesperson said.

It’s not exactly surprising. While stuck at home, online courses are a way to stay productive without leaving the house.

Photographer Radi Konstantinov told Decrypt he was looking for an online course to learn more about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

""I've always enjoyed tech but never had any formal training."" He explained. ""Last week I started learning JavaScript on Udemy in an effort to expand my skills, so far I'm really enjoying it and given my interest in crypto/blockchain the next logical step is learning about the blockchain framework and smart contracts,"" Konstantinov said.

""Even though the courses are short, it would be difficult to do this if life were in full swing,” he said, adding, ""This is why I'm taking the opportunity while I can.""

As Decrypt reported, the lockdown has already seen an increase in interest for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading. Multiple exchanges said they saw large increases in signups in March. Kraken, in particular, cited an 83% rise in signups in March.

But people don’t solely want to learn about—or trade—cryptocurrency.

A collective thirst for knowledge

The increase in demand for online Bitcoin courses is part of a wider trend.

With schools, universities, and other educational hubs all shuttered to quell the spread of COVID-19, scholars are seeking new avenues for learning. EdX—a nonprofit offering free online courses by heavy hitters Harvard, MIT, and others—told Decrypt it saw a ""massive increase in enrollments.""

The coronavirus has led to lockdowns around the world. Image: Shutterstock

GoSkills told Decrypt, “our online learning platform saw a spike in enrollments of people looking to upgrade their tech skills, especially with Excel courses and other software related programs.”

""This is 100% COVID driven,"" explained Lee Rubenstein, vice president of business development at edX. ""Employees and students need courses and skills.""

Class Central, an aggregator of online courses—including Coursera and edX—also saw a significant uptick in users, citing that it saw six million new users in the last three weeks.

If only they could teach people that the coronavirus isn’t caused by 5G.","The crypto market is on fire this week, with Bitcoin price exploding well above $7,000 and the rest of the market outperforming the leading crypto by market cap.

However, even though prices are taking off across the market, according to the Fear and Greed Index, the market is still in extreme fear. One crypto analyst says that prices rallying while investors are fearful is suggests the market is in a classic disbelief phase and following should be the first signs of hope of a sustainable long-term recovery in the digital asset class.

What Phase Is the Crypto Market Cycle In?

Crypto analysts have long argued over what stage of a classic market cycle the market is in. All markets are cyclical in nature, and the crypto market is no different.

Financial markets and even crypto assets go through regular, alternating periods of uptrend and growth, followed by downtrend and decline.

During these cycles, investors experience specific sets of emotions depending on where they are in each cycle. For example, when a top is near, and a cycle is about to peak, investors tend to be irrationally exuberant in their expectations for continued growth.

At that stage, investors often think they’re somehow a genius, and are about to strike it rich. They are blinded by their portfolio numbers increasing by the day and don’t see the collapse coming right in front of them.

The inverse is true at the bottom.

Classic Disbelief Phase Could Leave Investors Behind When Bitcoin Takes Off

Crypto investors have been mentally conditioned to expect more downside, have become fed up with the asset, and have lost hope for a recovery. This is called the disbelief stage and sneaks up on unsuspecting investors who have often have just been shaken out during a downtrend.

As the asset begins to pick up positive momentum once again, investors ignore the signals that an uptrend is starting.

They simply don’t believe the recovery is real or will have legs, and don’t take a position. Sooner than later, the asset has taken off on a powerful rally, and investors must FOMO-buy back into the asset at a higher price than they would have liked to, because they ignored the early signs that a recovery was taking place.

Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market has nearly doubled since the extreme low set back in mid-March, meanwhile, the crypto market Fear and Greed Index remains in a state of extreme fear, showing that this very well could be the disbelief rally that leaves burned and beaten investors in its dust, as the asset class takes off to new highs.

Featured image from Shutterstock","The latest installation of the cooking simulator Cooking Mama: Cookstar is at the center of controversy after being removed from Nintendo’s eShop just hours after its release.

While there’s no official statement as to why the game was abruptly pulled, rumors on various social media platforms allege that the title was using players’ Nintendo Switch consoles to mine Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency.

The accusations began when a Reddit user claimed that Cooking Mama: Cookstar was secretly mining crypto. The game’s association with crypto likely stems from the fact that its publisher originally stated the game would utilize blockchain technology.

1st Playable, the game’s developer, says the game contains zero code relating to crypto or blockchain.

“As the developers we can say with certainty there is no cryptocurrency or data collection or blockchain or anything else shady in the code. The Nintendo Switch is a very safe platform, with none of the data and privacy issues associated with some mobile and PC games.”

According to Screen Rant, a member of the development team says the game was removed from Nintendo’s eShop due to an ongoing legal battle between the game’s publisher, Planet Entertainment, and the intellectual property holder, Office Create.

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Mar1kOFF","Cryptocurrency mining firm Bitfarms, which is listed on Canada’s TSX Venture Exchange, has cut staff citing coronavirus effects.

Announcing the news on Monday, Bitfarms said the move is “temporary” in line with government guidance to help combat the spread of coronavirus. Bitfarms has also implemented “permanent measures” to reduce overhead costs to maintain “long term viability.""

“Once fully implemented over the next several weeks, we expect the cost saving measures to reduce our monthly general and administrative expenses by approximately 20 to 25%,” said Bitfarms CFO John Rim.

Rim further said that cost-cutting measures would help Bitfarms “withstand short-term volatility in mining economics and remain profitable through the long-term, including potential challenges relating to the upcoming Bitcoin halving.”

The hotly-anticipated bitcoin halving event, which will reduce block reward from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins, is expected to occur next month.

It remains unclear how many people have been let go of and what is Bitfarms’ current headcount. The Block has reached out to the firm and will update this story should we hear back.

Bitfarms currently operates five computing centers in Quebec, Canada, “powered by clean and competitively priced hydroelectricity,” per the announcement.

The firm said despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and “significant” drop of bitcoin price on March 12, it has been able to “optimize mining operations in real time to maintain maximum computer capacity.”



Since March 19, Bitfarms has maintained an average daily hashrate of approximately 750 petahash per second (PH).

“Our scale and quality of operations has allowed us to continue to generate positive cash flow in these difficult times,” said Bitfarms’ interim CEO and chief strategy officer Emiliano Grodzki.

Bitfarms joins a number of firms that have recently laid off their staff, including Galaxy Digital and Bitcoin.com. The former shaved 15% of its global workforce, while the latter cut 10% of its staff."
2020-04-08,"Bitcoin cash, the splinter cryptocurrency that forked from the Bitcoin blockchain in 2017, underwent its first programmable halving.

Like other proof-of-work blockchains, bitcoin cash (BCH) manages its monetary supply by slowly printing mining rewards to machines that secure its network by solving complicated mathematical problems. As of Wednesday morning, miners will receive half the amount of BCH for essentially the same amount of work. In the past, these “halving events” preceded cryptocurrency price rallies, but industry experts have their doubts a bull run is in store for Bitcoin Cash.

Top Story

Halving effects

Bitcoin cash – the blockchain that forked off bitcoin (BTC) in 2017 – reduced its block rewards by half, hitting some miners' gross revenues hard. The mining difficulty and hash rate on bitcoin cash – a measure of how much miner power is participating on the network – was already on a downward trend in the run up to the halving, following a drop in the splinter currency’s price.

The bitcoin cash event foreshadows the halving scheduled for the Bitcoin network in about 35 days, which is 26 times larger than BCH in terms of market capitalization, as well as Bitcoin SV’s halving expected this Friday. Halvings have been an important variable in cryptocurrency price increases in the past, though developers on these break-off chains expect some miners to defect for more lucrative opportunities. Roger Ver, BCH’s project steward, said it will be a “non-event.”

DeFiers

TD Ameritrade, Cumberland, CMT Digital, DV Trading and Jump Trading, as well as venture capital firm Volt Capital and the DeFi startup Compound, joined forces in the Chicago DeFi Alliance (CDA). Announced Wednesday, the new group will focus on providing advisory services to select crypto startups working on decentralized finance initiatives.

Tezos is getting a “wrapped” version of bitcoin, bringing BTC’s liquidity and the hopes of a nascent decentralized financial ecosystem to its proof-of-stake blockchain. Bitcoin Association Switzerland, Tezos Foundation and multiple partners will issue the token, called tzBTC. The news comes on the heels of a tBTC “bridge” between Ethereum and Bitcoin announced last week.

Programmable money

The Bank of England (BoE) thinks private cryptocurrencies may have a role in the future of money. Although the BoE has already said bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies don't meet the necessary criteria to be considered money, CBDC analyst Ben Dyson said, ""that doesn't mean that it's impossible for somebody to improve upon that technology and create something that much better fulfills the qualities of money.”

Banking services provider Sila has raised $7.7 million to build out a platform that allows entrepreneurs to easily launch programmable, USD-pegged stablecoins.

Exchanges

Account holders at the now-defunct Cryptopia exchange are entitled to their balances still held in trust, a judge has ruled. This decision places the interests of exchange users over the 37 creditors and 90 shareholders also vying for their portion of the remaining assets.

Liquidity

Bid-ask spreads on major exchanges widened dramatically in March, following coronavirus-led market turmoil. The bid-ask spread is an indicator of market liquidity, measuring the gap between the highest price a buyer would pay and the lowest price a seller would accept.

Halving hope

Halvings are not always bullish, and many experts think bitcoin cash has a rough road ahead to retain price and mining capacity. “The conventional crypto wisdom that halvings magically induce a bull run such that the real USD value of miner revenue does not cut in half is naive wishful thinking, encouraging investors to be fooled by correlation/causation,” said Zach Resnick, managing partner at Unbound Capital.

In May of 2020, bitcoin is expected to undergo its third “halving,” a programmed supply reduction that has in the past coincided with a strong run-up in the bitcoin price. In this paper, we explain what the bitcoin halving is, why it matters and why the market is so focused on this event.

And nowhere is that inflation resistance more evident than in bitcoin’s once-every-four-years “halving.” That’s when issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency automatically gets cut in half. The plan, expected to continue for at least another century, was coded into the underlying blockchain network’s programming when it was launched 11 years ago. The mechanism’s very purpose was to prevent a rapid debasement of bitcoin’s purchasing power.

Bitcoin’s next halving isn’t expected until May. But two lesser cryptocurrencies, bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV, are due for their halvings this week, offering an advance glimpse of the quadrennial phenomenon.

""You're going to get a sneak preview of what happens with bitcoin in a month,"" said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of Digital Asset Research, a New York-based analysis firm.

Bitcoin cash (BCH), a cryptocurrency that split off or “forked” from bitcoin in 2017, is expected to undergo its halving on Wednesday. Bitcoin SV (BSV), which forked from Bitcoin cash the following year, is due for a halving on Friday.

In the realm of cryptocurrencies, the two forked cryptocurrencies are considered also-rans, with a combined total market value of roughly $8 billion, versus $131 billion for bitcoin.

But since halvings constitute a crucial chapter of any crash course in cryptoeconomics, the episodes bear watching. Many crypto traders say big price swings often coincide with halvings, providing ample opportunities for speculation. The German bank BayernLB predicted last year that bitcoin’s halving could drive its price to $90,000, roughly 12 times the current level.

The most likely outcome of this week’s halvings, according to the analysis firm Arcane Research, is an immediate drop in profits for computer operators supporting the two lesser blockchains. These “miners” will then probably just shift their computing power to the bigger bitcoin network, where the halving is still a month away. Such computing resources, known as hashpower in the industry jargon, are crucial for keeping these blockchain networks secure – preventing theft or other abuses.

“It’s going to push more hash toward the bitcoin network,” says Matt D’Souza, co-founder and CEO of Blockware Solutions, which brokers high-speed computers used for cryptocurrency mining.

The loss of hashpower on the smaller blockchains might make them more vulnerable to a takeover by a malicious actor in what’s known as a 51 percent attack. That’s when an individual or cabal amasses sufficient computing resources to co-opt the network – similar to the way a corporate raider might try to buy enough equity in a company to force a takeover.

Mike Maloney, chief financial officer of Coinmint, a cryptocurrency-mining company, estimates that if the security of the Bitcoin Cash network fell by half, an attack would require the computing equivalent of about 400 megawatts of electricity – roughly the output of a medium-size power plant. By contrast, it would take 6,000 to 10,000 megawatts to attack the Bitcoin blockchain, he says.

Bitcoin cash’s halving “will hurt the overall hashrate/security of an already vulnerable blockchain,” says Michael Thoma, co-founder and lead analyst at cryptocurrency-rating firm CryptoEQ.

What happens in cryptocurrency markets, as a result of this week’s halvings, is a bit more speculative. Prices for bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV might fall because holders of those digital tokens might suddenly start worrying about the vulnerability, says Dave Perrill, CEO of Compute North, which provides hosting facilities and services for cryptocurrency miners.

While the hashpower shift would bolster security on the bitcoin blockchain, miners there would suddenly face more competition – resulting in a dilution of profits.

“We see mining as largely as an experience like evolution, Darwinism,” Perrill says.

He notes that it will be difficult to draw too many parallels between this week’s episodes and bitcoin’s halving in May. That’s partly because so much of the crypto industry has evolved around bitcoin, and there’s such a huge community of traders, developers and marketers who are focused on making it successful, Perrill says. In digital-asset markets, bitcoin is the bellwether, and lesser coins like bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV are often merely trading in sync.

Litecoin (LTC), yet another spinoff from bitcoin, provided a cautionary tale when it underwent a halving in August of last year. While the price quadrupled in the first half of 2019, it peaked a couple months before the halving and tumbled over the rest of the year.

Litecoin suffered a steep drop in both price and hashrate following its last halving on Aug. 5, 2019. Source: Data: Coin Metrics. Chart: CoinDesk Research's Christine Kim.

Suffice to say the digital-asset industry is still so new compared with traditional finance that nobody’s really certain how the various halvings will play out. Many bitcoiners have a remarkably sophisticated grasp on old-finance concepts like the theory of efficient markets, and even within the cryptocurrency industry there are wide-ranging opinions on whether the halving – an event that’s known years in advance – is already baked into the price.

“Halvings are not unilaterally positive events for cryptocurrencies,” the analysis firm Messari wrote in a December report. “Maybe Bitcoin is different, but maybe it’s not.”

This week’s halvings on the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV blockchains will provide additional data points – ahead of next month’s featured event.

Tweet of the Day

Bitcoin Watch

BTC: Price: $7,334 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $7,464 | 24-Hr Low: $7,081

Trend: Bitcoin is holding ground at press time, but struggling to take out the 50-day average for the second day running. The cryptocurrency is trading near $7,334, representing a 1.6 percent gain on the day, having tested the 50-day MA at $7,422 during the early European trading hours.

A look at the four-hour chart shows the cryptocurrency has failed three times in the last 24 hours or so to keep gains above the psychological resistance of $7,400.

The repeated bull failure, coupled with the four-hour chart MACD’s bearish cross below zero indicates scope for a drop to ascending trendline support near $7,000. The risk-off tone in the global equity markets also favors a pullback in bitcoin.

At press time, major European indices like Germany’s DAX and U.K.’s FTSE are reporting around 1 percent drops. The cryptocurrency has closely tracked action in the equity markets over the past few weeks.

On the higher side, a sustained move above $7,400 would open the doors to $8,000.","A group of Switzerland-based crypto firms has come together to launch “tzBTC” - a 1:1 bitcoin-backed token on the Tezos blockchain.

The news was announced on Wednesday by the Bitcoin Association Switzerland, which monitors the tzBTC system. It said tzBTC gives holders the ability to interact with Tezos smart contracts while pegging to the value of bitcoin.



The tzBTC system has two parties - “Keyholders” and “Gatekeepers.” Keyholders are custodians and include four little-known firms - token issuer Swiss Crypto Tokens, Blockchain services firm Inacta, custody infrastructure firm Taurus and crypto legal services firm LEXR.

Gatekeepers, on the other hand, accept bitcoin from users and allocate tzBTC in return. These include crypto financial services firm Bitcoin Suisse, crypto bank Sygnum, crypto market maker Woorton, crypto exchange Bity and Taurus.

“Our goal with tzTBC is to make bitcoin even more accessible and flexible, strengthening its position as the leading currency,” Lucas Betschart, president of Bitcoin Association Switzerland, told The Block.

The Association said the only difference between bitcoin and tzBTC is that the latter can interact with functionalities of the Tezos blockchain and, therefore, can be deployed in Tezos-based decentralized applications.

""Taking the largest cryptocurrency and connecting it to the Tezos blockchain is like bringing the railroad to the gold mine - it allows for transportability and opens up possibilities for use,"" Armin Schmid, CEO of Swiss Crypto Tokens, told The Block.



""We believe very much in the benefits of decentralization and it's great to be a part of this decentralized community effort to connect the bitcoin ecosystem with the growing Tezos community and all the possibilities of the Tezos blockchain,"" Schmid added.

A representative of the Tezos Foundation said tzBTC does not have specific decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations yet, as it just launched, ""but the institutional support in the DeFi community is incredibly strong.""","Developer 1st Playable has denied rumors one of their games was used to hijack Nintendo’s Switch console to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

While the recent Nintendo release, Cooking Mama: Cookstar, is connected to blockchain technology — it’s not in the way some players have speculated.

Addressing the rumors on Twitter, 1st Playable said there was absolutely nothing “shady in the code”:

As the developers we can say with certainty there is no cryptocurrency or data collection or blockchain or anything else shady in the code. The Nintendo Switch is a very safe platform, with none of the data and privacy issues associated with some mobile and PC games. — 1st Playable (@1stPlayable) April 5, 2020

The official Cooking Mama: Cookstar account echoed this, pointing out it had only considered utilizing blockchain “as a means to allow players to trade in-game assets,” not to mine cryptocurrency:

“The internet is alive with rumors that Cooking Mama: Cookstar contains hidden cryptocurrency/blockchain capabilities that are causing the Switch to overheat. This is absolutely incorrect.”

It later stated: “Cookstar, nor any of our other titles in the past or near future will utilize crypto technology.”

How the rumors got started

The Nintendo console was reported to use blockchain prior to its release, which did not create much of a stir at the time. However, when Cooking Mama: Cookstar was suddenly no longer available in Nintendo’s eShop just a few hours after its release, the rumor mill went into overdrive on Reddit and Twitter.

Combined with reports that the Switch was prone to overheating and an easily drained battery, some users speculated that the console was surreptitiously being used to mine cryptocurrencies.

While there’s no official statement from Nintendo as yet about why the game was pulled in the first place, the rumors have begun to subside in the face of pushback from the developers and independent analyses of the code.

Less-than-reputable methods for cryptocurrency minings

While the Cookstar rumors appear unfounded, there have been some instances of hackers and supposedly reputable companies cryptojacking processing power.

After basketball legend Kobe Bryant’s death, hackers took advantage of fans searching for digital reminders to hide malicious HTML code in a desktop wallpaper featuring the NBA star. The code allowed them to hijack processing power from the infected computers to mine cryptocurrencies remotely.

Larger platforms aren’t exempt either. A clone website for Cryptohopper was discovered last year. Hackers installed a Trojan on anyone who clicked a certain link on the site. This enabled them to use any computer infected with the virus for mining, among other things. Even YouTube has had its share of attempts by cryptojackers.","The futuristic utopia that technological progress promises is coming ever closer at an astonishing pace, yet unseen challenges, have surfaced during the COVID-19 virus outbreak. The pandemic has managed to plunder and destabilize the world in just the last few months, putting in danger not only lives, but economic boundaries, well-established global businesses, and the very essence of the world’s financial system.

The uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the coronavirus and its impact on the global economy are gripping. The world was not ready for a global pandemic, just as it wasn’t during the Spanish flu of 1918-1920 where tens of millions died, along with similar global plagues in history, like the Black Plague of the 1300s.

What is different this time is the fact our world has never been more technologically connected, with people able to work remotely, buy online, see a doctor through video conferencing, and purchase digital currencies unencumbered by the limitations of fiat currencies.

Indeed, well before COVID-19 arrived on the scene, digital assets have become a slowly maturing niche. The last decade has seen a new kind of currency evolve, with the Bitcoin cryptocurrency having emerged at the right time to save the world with a new definition of speed, transparency, and reliability, thanks to Bitcoin’s twin revolution of the blockchain.

The King is Dead - Long Live The New King!

The 21st century is the digital century, and it is dictating a new set of rules. For centuries, during numerous crises triggered by various events, gold has traditionally been considered the safe haven to rule them all. Indeed, despite some fluctuations, its price has risen over time, while in the main, it has held its value well, and unlike fiat currencies, has never seen its value go to zero. However, despite being the most popular metal when a crisis is associated with liquidity or inflation problems, gold has not always successfully passed through global crises unblemished, with an example being the Great Depression seeing private gold ownership banned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, and gold fixed at US $35 from 1934 for many years thereafter.

Meanwhile, an original and top-performing crypto-asset Bitcoin is playing its own game, weakly correlating with market trends.

Naturally, this has led to Bitcoin and gold having long been competing with each other for the status of a more effective protective asset, and in this situation, cryptocurrencies have some advantages. Shiny metal owners depend on transport and logistics - sectors of the economy that are prone to supply disruptions and logistics issues, given the times. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is a digital currency that exists in cyberspace and is not constrained by state borders nor transportation problems. This aspect acquires particular relevance in times of global panic when familiar ties are disrupted, destroyed and order upended.

Searching for a New Value Investment Channel

What is Bitcoin's core attraction point? Simply put, this asset provides the freedom to convert its value into a form of money that defies manipulation.

Before Bitcoin stepped in to play a decade ago, people had no choice but to be caged into a defective currency system. The Bitcoin protocol, based on the voluntary participation of the parties, is not controlled by anyone, and makes it possible for everyone to store and transfer value in a currency that is resistant to manipulation by central banks and global financial institutions.

Different parties value cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular for various reasons. Despite being mainly praised for enrichment due to its rapid price increase in 2017, it invariably attracts those who saw the degree of freedom inherent in Bitcoin, given that the world is experiencing endless economic disasters due to the fragility and instability of the global financial system, and even greater levels of public, private and government debt in the age of COVID-19, lockdowns and massive multi-trillion dollar government bailouts.

However, it’s not only the crypto-anarchists who are praising crypto and Bitcoin in particular. Among well-known Bitcoin adopters is an American venture capital investor and billionaire Tim Draper, who has claimed that Bitcoin is a key to secure the financial future for millennials. Moreover, Draper also told CNBC that he is moving his stock portfolio to Bitcoin, presuming that “bitcoin in 2022 or the beginning of 2023 will hit $250,000”. Finally,Draper has recently given another optimistic forecast about Bitcoin - stating that he thinks “when the world comes back, it will be Bitcoin, not banks and governments that save the day.”

Bitcoin is Immune to Coronavirus

Today, the world faces a problem of an unusual nature. The virus outbreak in Asia was first regarded as a looming, but distant threat, yet now leads to the collapse of many companies and economies. Even more, it threatens disruptions in supply chains at international levels that have been forged by the blood, sweat, tears, global wars, technological advancement, international competition, co-operation and global progress made over many decades.

Europe saw stocks fall to their lowest levels since 2012 as the coronavirus continued to ravage share prices and investors weighed the extreme and unexpected economic hit. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down 2.7 percent, Germany’s Dax was 2.7 percent lower and Italy’s FTSE Mib had fallen 1.6 percent. During such events, investors need to search for a better investment instrument conducive to a much safer long-term perspective.

Moreover, in times where market turmoil, caused by the virus, digital money and fintech apps have seen usage grow significantly, thus speeding the pace of overall technological progress. In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic has fueled a 72% surge in the use of fintech apps in Europe during the few last weeks as people globally try adapting to new working conditions, according to new research by the deVere Group. Digital money is safe-to-use to provide remote payments - a quality one merely thought of as a mostly just a convenience before, but now one that is more important than ever in a world that prefers electronic payments to the risk of handling potentially virus-infected physical currency.

Bitcoin may still be at an early stage of its lifecycle, and its price is unknown in the future, but it has been the most exciting and promising currency development since the development of fiat currency, and has ignited the imagination not only of billionaires, but the general public eager for an alternative to fiat currencies and precious metals. This is followed by the fact that Bitcoin is an asset that has almost unlimited potential in terms of price growth, and as Pantera Capital’s estimates show, has new price records that can be expected in 2021. Moreover, Nexo's researchers and analysts predict that a massive rise in the Bitcoin price could occur due to the upcoming halving event, and the level of $50,000 could be surpassed in 2020 alone! At the same time, researchers at the Kraken crypto exchange platform state that the Bitcoin price could reach $350,000 by 2045, with this last opinion based on the expected wealth transfer that could happen over the forthcoming decades.

Now, it has to be said that trying to pick the right moment to act can be ruined by trying to predict the perfect moment, and thus never acting at all. Thus, an opportunity to buy top-rating cryptocurrency awaits, and one must not be hesitant about whether to buy it or not, just as so many did when Bitcoins were worth pennies, rather than the thousands of dollars they are worth now.

As the world progresses and fights back against the pandemic, Bitcoin’s value and acceptance will only grow, from routine payments and daily coffees at Starbucks to much more sophisticated uses yet to be imagined and created by necessity being the mother of invention. Bitcoin has provided a new financial canvas with its users having painted an impressive first layer. Now the time has come to add more paint, life and color to the painting so a true masterpiece emerges and the full picture of endless possibility is undeniable to all.","Decentralized exchange (DEX) Bisq rang the alarm bells last night after a hacker exploited a significant software flaw to steal more than $250,000 worth of cryptocurrency from users.

Bisq, which allows users to exchange crypto anonymously, abruptly disabled trading late Tuesday night after it uncovered “a critical security vulnerability.”

At the time, the exchange did not release any information regarding the nature of the flaw or whether user funds were safe. But 18 hours after it halted trading, Bisq said it took the “unprecedented” step after finding an attacker was exploiting a flaw in the software to steal cryptocurrency from other users.

“About 24 hours ago, we discovered that an attacker was able to exploit a flaw in the Bisq trade protocol, targeting individual trades in order to steal trading capital. We are aware of approximately 3 BTC and 4,000 XMR stolen from 7 different victims. This is the situation as we know it so far,” Bisq said in a statement to CoinDesk.

The value of the crypto stolen was roughly $22,000 worth of bitcoin (BTC) and $230,000 worth of monero (XMR), according to CoinDesk data at press time. In total, that comes to more than $250,000.

To carry out the thefts, the attacker was able to set other users’ default fallback address – the destination to which crypto is sent to if a trade fails – to their own. Posing as a seller, they would start a trade with a buyer and simply wait for the time limit to run out. Rather than going to the legitimate owner, the digital assets arrived with the attacker, along with the buyer’s payment and security deposit too.

The flaw in question came as part of a recent update to the trading protocol, which was designed to improve decentralization and remove trusted third parties from the platform.

Bisq managed to fix the flaw by 12:00 UTC Wednesday and told CoinDesk just before publication that trading had just resumed again.

Bisq released onto testnet back in late 2018 as an exchange structured as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It works in much the same way as other DEXs, but users can trade anonymously as there are no registration or identity verification requirements.

With the platform based on a distributed network, each user effectively acts as a node. Although Bisq’s developers had suspended trading, the exchange’s decentralized nature means users could override the suspension should they wish.

In most cases of an exchange hack, the attacker can be booted off the trading platform for good. Not so with Bisq. One of the DEX’s associated developers told CoinDesk that although the flaw was fixed, there was nothing to prevent the attacker – whose identity cannot be known – from accessing and trading on the platform again.","Cryptocurrency, broadly defined as virtual or digital money, came to limelight with the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. The cryptocurrency has expanded dramatically, ushering the new wave of virtual currency built on a decentralised peer-to-peer network.

BUX Crypto!

Recently, BUX announced the official launch of BUX Crypto, a platform that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies easily and commission-free. This launch follows the announcement of the acquisition of Blockport by BUX in January of this year.","WASHINGTON, April 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- What people believe cryptocurrency is used to purchase strongly differs from what is actually purchased with cryptocurrency, according to new survey data from Visual Objects , a portfolio website.

Visual Objects surveyed 983 people familiar with digital currency about how they use and perceive it, including 157 cryptocurrency owners.



Graph - What People Purchase With Cryptocurrency Graph - What People Think Is Purchased With Cryptocurrency

People believe that cryptocurrency is primarily used to purchase stocks (40%) and illegal items (30%). Fewer than one-fifth believe it's mainly used to purchase clothing (15%) or food (14%).

In comparison, cryptocurrency owners say they most frequently purchase food (38%) and clothing (34%) with the currency, followed by stocks (29%).

Though it's impossible to know exactly how many illegal cryptocurrency transactions are happening, the data suggests that cryptocurrency is used for everyday purchases more than the general public believes.

Cryptocurrency Began on the Black Market but Can Now Lead to Positive Change

The first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, initially grew popular on the black market. Now, though, larger businesses are beginning to accept it as a form of payment:

Microsoft accepts bitcoin as payment in its Xbox store

Overstock currently accepts and holds multiple forms of cryptocurrency

KFC Canada accepts bitcoin as payment for food

Expedia accepts bitcoin to purchase flights and other forms of travel

Microsoft Founder Bill Gates even sees cryptocurrency as a means of achieving income equality .

""If we were building a financial system from scratch today, we'd do it on a digital platform,"" Gates said. ""Digital can lower the cost of a range of transactions by as much as 90%, providing nearly universal access to innovative financial products and services.""

In the past, though, Gates has also strongly denounced cryptocurrency , given its anonymity.

Overall, only 16% of people familiar with cryptocurrency have actually invested in it, indicating that cryptocurrency's stereotypes may be impacting its adoption potential.

Bitcoin Is Most Widely Owned Cryptocurrency

The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is still the most popular. Nearly three-quarters of cryptocurrency owners surveyed (70%) say they own bitcoin.

Bitcoin must be ""mined"" by answering complex math questions through an autonomous software program run by a lottery-based system. Mining bitcoin requires intense computational power .

Bitcoin has dropped in value due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with its current value approximating $7,000 as of April 7, 2020.

The next most popular cryptocurrencies are Ethereum (27%), Litecoin (20%), and Dogecoin (15%).

","The consequences of COVID-19 are expected to exceed that of the 2008 recession, as well as the Great Depression, and global economies are facing unprecedented and uncertain times. The economic shock reverberating around the world has forced governments to act quickly and implement policies and, with the effects of the pandemic permeating every aspect of society, many businesses are preparing to navigate in a new world, post-health crises.

But what will an economic downturn mean for blockchain and cryptocurrencies? We have gathered commentary from a range of industry experts (below) including the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, Ontology, DeFiner, CRUXPay, and NEM Ventures who shared their insights on what a global recession could mean for digital assets.

Nick Cowan, CEO of the GSX Group, said:

“Cryptocurrencies are not immune to market turbulence, with natural fluctuations illustrating regular asset class behaviour in so far as smart money trading and herd mentality tendencies are clearly visible in the market. The dizzying price high that defined late 2017 was an unrealistic representation of BTC and the subsequent price drop painted a picture of high volatility. However, since then, market patterns have been generally positive, with normal peaks and troughs along the way.

In terms of a post-pandemic market, I don’t expect cryptocurrencies to suddenly become a fixture in the safe haven category with gold for example. Rather, adoption levels will continue to increase, particularly as major financial institutions and fintech platforms continue to show interest in this asset class. However, the idea that blockchain-powered finance is limited to cryptocurrencies is passé, and there are other significant developments enabled by blockchain that will broaden global liquidity pools, specifically the proliferation of tokenized or digital securities.

As we emerge from this global pandemic, I would also expect to see a considered reevaluation of the capital markets infrastructure, particularly around the T+2 model, the period in which securities transactions have been historically settled. This delay of two days places unnecessary stresses on the capital markets, particularly around the prevalence of counterparty risk. Harnessing blockchain can help classify this protracted settlement delay and counterparty risks as obsolete.”

Erick Pinos, Ontology Americas Ecosystem Lead, said:

“Bitcoin was one of a number of technological innovations created in response to the 2008 financial crash, and in March 2020, the UK and US markets suffered their worst day since.

The concept of Bitcoin as a safe haven during a global recession is one that has long been touted by industry players. However, so far, the current market downturn has not resulted in investors flocking to Bitcoin. At this point in the crisis, this is not surprising. It’s important to remember that it is still very early days for both the crisis, and for Bitcoin. Bitcoin has never lived through a recession, so it’s difficult to predict how things might pan out, and how actors might respond in what is likely to be a long road to economic recovery.

What we can expect to see as a result of the global pandemic is an even greater spotlight on digital assets, each from governments, central banks, traditional investors, and enterprises. This is due to their ability to offer users increased trust, security, and access, while also providing an opportunity to avoid many of the risks associated with traditional markets and fiat currencies.”

Jason Wu, CEO of DeFiner.org, a true peer-to-peer network for digital savings, loans, and payments, said:

“A recession will be the catalyst for the mass adoption of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi builds trust using code and mathematics, whereas the traditional financial system is based on human trust and company reputation. DeFi allows people to manage and own their assets without any intermediaries. The 2008 financial crisis taught people that financial intermediaries are not always trustworthy. The current financial system is associated with high-costs and lacks transparency. Thus, a future financial crisis could also be a factor in proving the worth of DeFi. Bitcoin was born from the last financial crisis and DeFi will thrive in these economic conditions. While a global recession will be good for digital assets, it will crush the market at the beginning due to the liquidity crisis. The world of cryptocurrency will suffer first, then prosper. There are three phases: Liquidity, Suffering, and Thriving.

In phase one, the cryptocurrencies market will face liquidity issues and a price drop, as will all financial assets. This has happened last month as bitcoin price dropped dramatically from approx. $9000 to $4000. In the financial crisis, everyone is looking for liquidity, because their normal cash flow is interrupted. In phase two, cryptocurrencies will suffer, together with other industries. In this phase, a lot of companies will go bankrupt and people will lose their jobs. Financial institutions will go into default and bankruptcy, and balance sheets of depository banks will end up with a deficit. Then the central bank will step in and print out even more money. This will lead to inflation. In phase three, people lose faith in the existing financial system. DeFi is an alternative system for people to manage and grow their savings. It’s cheaper, faster, and gives back people full control of wealth. People will learn from their painful experiences and embrace the world of crypto to enjoy true financial freedom. For the next several decades, more and more assets will be managed through blockchain and the world of digital assets will thrive.”

Ashish Singhal, CEO and Co-founder of CRUXPay and Coinswitch.co, said:

“At first sight, the idea that digital assets and cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, are a safe haven seems to have gone out of the window. Cryptocurrencies seem to be taking as much beating as debt, equity, and commodities like Gold. This happens because, at the onset of a recession, when panic strikes, all fundamentals are lost. However, during a crisis, debt and equity lose value because of the decline in asset value and decline in profit, respectively. But the underlying value of cryptocurrencies doesn’t lose value during a recession; infact, it gets even stronger.

A global recession is a defining moment for cryptocurrencies. The long-touted “bitcoin is a safe haven” is put to the test during a recession. A recession forces governments worldwide to introduce measures to ease the downturn, which will have adverse economic effects for years to come. Cryptocurrencies are inherently designed to be hedged against such implications. This makes an excellent case in favour of cryptocurrencies.

When the crisis starts, panic hits and irrationality creeps in; the markets will see a massive sell off in all categories. The decline in asset value and profits during a global recession will drive debt and equity prices to even lower levels. And this might further lower the prices of cryptocurrencies. However, it is not an indication of loss in the inherent value of cryptocurrencies. The underlying value of cryptocurrencies defined by decentralisation and mathematical stability will continue to hold even in the worst recessions. Cryptocurrencies will then become the choice of investment during such economic turmoil.”

Nicholas Pelecanos, Head of Trading at NEM Ventures, commented:

“Hidden in the bitcoin genesis block is a quote that perhaps acknowledges Bitcoin’s true purpose: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”. The creation of Bitcoin is not incidental to financial crises but a direct response to the 2008 financial crash and failings of the global financial system. As a global recession or even depression looms, I’m more bullish on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies than ever. Unlimited QE, unserviceable global debt, a failing monetary system and negative interest rates all at a time where society, globally is moving away from cash. This is precisely what Bitcoin was designed to hedge against.

The crypto sell-off witnessed in March was a result of a global liquidity event and Bitcoin has now climbed 90% from its low—a swift recovery. More importantly than being a safe haven, Cryptocurrencies are an uncorrelated asset class. This alone can attract a lot of capital in times of uncertainty and with a total market capitalization of $200bn it won’t take much capital inflow for the price to rapidly climb.”"

Bitcoin's break above a long-term moving average resistance near $7,100 has strengthened the case for a rally to $8,000.

A drop in trading volumes is a cause for concern for the bulls, however.

The outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above support near $6,800.

After multiple failed attempts, bitcoin (BTC) has finally broken above key resistance, bringing a boost to the short-term bullish case.

The top cryptocurrency

by market value closed (UTC) well above $7,100 on Wednesday, marking an upside

break of the 200-period moving average on the three-day chart.

The breakout could now invite stronger chart-driven buying, as a move above the long-term technical line is often considered a confirmation of a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

The 200-period average had repeatedly capped upside in the final days of March. Now that the hurdle has been convincingly crossed, buyers who entered the market earlier this month may also be more comfortable in holding their positions. All in all, the move is a good signal for prices.

The risk-on action seen in traditional markets is also supportive of further gains for bitcoin. Major European indices like Germany’s DAX and the U.K.’s FTSE are currently reporting slight gains. Asian stocks also rose early on Thursday following an overnight surge on Wall Street.

The sentiment seems to have been buoyed by reports that the U.S. and European nations are discussing plans to reopen their respective economies at the start of May. Most countries imposed lockdowns of varying degrees of severity in March in order to contain the coronavirus outbreak, negatively impacting commerce.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $7,340, representing a 0.80 percent increase on a 24-hour basis., according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. That’s well above the 200-period average at $7,093.

The cryptocurrency has recovered by more than $3,400 from the low of $3,867 reached during the early Asian trading hours on March 13 and is now just $700 short of levels near $8,000 seen ahead of the price crash seen March 12.

Three-day chart

Bitcoin repeatedly failed to cross the 200-period average hurdle in the three weeks to April 5, weakening the immediate bullish case and raising the odds of a price pullback.

However, the breakout confirmed by the previous green candle, representing price action for April 6-9, indicates that the rally from lows below $4,000 has resumed.

The MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes, has crossed above zero, signaling a bearish-to-bullish trend change. Further, the Chaikin money flow index is hovering above zero – a sign buying pressure is outweighing selling pressure.

All in all, there is a strong case to believe bitcoin will test psychological resistance at $8,000 in the short-term.

Daily chart

Bitcoin is trapped in an ascending price channel, as seen above.

Monday’s green marubozu candle, which marked a breakout above $7,000, points to bullish market sentiment. The five- and 10-day averages are trending north, indicating strong upward momentum.

The only cause for concern for the bulls is a decline in trading volumes. A low-volume rally often ends with a notable price drop.","Bitcoin SV, the network that split off from the Bitcoin Cash blockchain in late 2018, has cut its miners’ block reward in half for the first time.

Miners on the network produced the 630,000th block around 00:50 UTC time on Friday, which, by design, triggered the halving event that reduced mining rewards from 12.5 BSV to 6.25 per block.

BSV is now trading at $214 as of press time, for a market capitalization of $3.9 billion, making the network the market’s sixth largest cryptocurrency. It’s down 5.4 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s price index.

The halving means the daily output for newly mined BSV is now around 900 units, which, at BSV’s current price, means the pie of block rewards miners can compete over totals about $200,000 a day.

The total computing power racing on Bitcoin SV has declined by some 25 percent since a recent high around four exahashes per second (EH/s) in early February, following BSV’s price plunge from $370 to $110 within a month. The price had bounced back to over $200 over the past several weeks.

The halving event came just a day after the same milestone for Bitcoin Cash, which broke off the Bitcoin network following a heated community disagreement in 2017. Miners on the Bitcoin SV network may face the same profitability issue as those on Bitcoin Cash.

Following Bitcoin Cash’s halving Wednesday, the hashing power on the network has dropped from around 3.5 EH/s to 2.5 EH/s. It took miners about 100 minutes to mine the first block after the Wednesday halving, while the average block production time is designed to be 10 minutes.

This week marked the first halvings for the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV networks since their births in 2017 and 2018, respectively.","Q1 Crypto Trade Volume Jumps 61%, Bitcoin's Price Performance Trumps Equity and Gold Markets

For well over a month now, a great number of countries have been living under lockdowns and stay-at-home orders due to the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, central banks like the Fed, Bank of England (BoE), and European Central Bank (ECB) have funneled trillions into the hands of private financial incumbents. Despite the market carnage on March 12, cryptocurrency markets have gone against the trend and remain resilient. Bitcoin and digital currency trade volumes in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020 have outshined Q1 2019’s volumes by 61%.

Lockdowns and Stimulus Fuels Crypto Trade Volumes

The coronavirus scare has ravaged the global economy by touching every continent on the planet. The covid-19 virus can lead to severe illness and even death as it has caused the nation state’s politicians to shut down the economy. Bureaucrats have forced the citizenry to stay-at-home with specific lockdown mandates. Bureaucratic leaders have also shut down major industries including services like hotels, restaurants, airlines, cruises, and more. Essentially, depending on your jurisdiction, a shelter-in-place (lockdown) order means residents are asked to stay home and not leave their residence to travel unless it’s an emergency.

All of these actions have caused the stock market to crumble, real estate markets shudder, and oil has dropped below $20 per barrel of crude. Just like bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, on ‘Black Thursday’ March 12, gold took a big hit and dropped to a low of $1,579 per Troy ounce. Since then, gold has gained 5.3% in value to-date, as an ounce of fine gold is selling for $1,661 at press time. BTC dropped to a low of $3,800 on March 12, but prices have since gained 90.78% in value. Even though the global economy has been stumbling, digital assets have surpassed equity and precious metals markets by a long shot.

Q1 Crypto Trade Volume 61% Higher Than 2019 – Bitcoin Derivatives Volumes Climb

Exchanges reported that ‘Black Thursday’ saw a record $70 billion in global trade volume, as trading platforms were swamped with both buyers and sellers. Bitcoin options skyrocketed to a record $198 million that day as well as crypto derivatives, specifically options and futures, had a landmark month. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) swapped $347 million worth of bitcoin futures contracts on April 2. Moreover, the derivatives exchange Bitmex has lost dominance to other futures market players like Okex, Huobi, and Binance.

The Block’s Steven Zheng reviewed the volumes of 22 major crypto exchanges and discovered a considerable spike in Q1 2020 compared to 2019’s first quarter. Zheng’s statistics indicate that trade volumes jumped to over $154 billion in Q1 2020, which was a 61% increase compared to Q1 2019. Despite the rising volumes, some analysts think that the crypto trade volumes need to continue increasing or adverse trends will crush optimism.

Digital Currency Exchanges See a 1,000% Increase in Crypto Trading Activity – 90% Buyers

There’s also been an influx of peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange volume in certain countries on platforms like Local.bitcoin.com, Paxful, Mycrypto, Hodlhodl, and Localbitcoins. Regions that are seeing a lot more P2P trade volume in countries like Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, South Africa, Sweden, Tanzania, and Venezuela. Additionally, the San Francisco exchange Coinbase saw its best month of trade volumes in March. The blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis recently noted that exchange volumes in mid-March were 9X higher than the usual daily average.

The London fintech firm Mode Banking’s cryptocurrency application saw a 1,000% increase in trade volume at the end of March. Mode detailed that the week after the United Kingdom was placed on official lockdown, the Mode app saw a massive spike in crypto trading activity. 90% of the trades were buyers and most of Mode’s user base stems from the U.K. Mode Banking attributes the massive crypto buying to the coronavirus and stimulus packages being funneled to private banks.

“The impact of Coronavirus aid packages and monetary stimulus programs,” Mode wrote on April 9. “Trillions of dollars have been pumped into economies and stock markets around the world. This has been causing longer-term concerns about the U.S. dollar and other currencies becoming debased, and inflation rising.” Mode further stated:

The nature of Bitcoin means that quantitative easing and other monetary measures do not directly affect its price and thus it can be used to hedge against the impact of these on fiat currencies.

Digital Currency Markets Go Against the Grain

At the time of publication, the crypto economy is hovering around the $210 billion zone and there’s roughly $25 billion worth of global crypto trades right now. Most of the top 20 coins are relatively stable but cryptos like tezos, bitcoinsv, chainlink, and bitcoin gold have seen decent gains on Thursday. A number of lesser-known digital assets are doing well like bora, ethlend, acute angle cloud, hdac, and swftcoin. Overall traders and enthusiasts are positive about the market holding up during all the lockdowns and stimulus injections.

Moreover, people will see even more inflation when countries like Spain, Canada, and the U.S. toss out helicopter money to the citizenry. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told U.S. politicians from the House of Representatives that around 60 million Americans will get their stimulus check next week if they used the IRS direct deposit system. Although, Mnuchin recently admitted that those who did not register with direct deposit would not get a check until late August.

Now Bitmain operated BTC.com was able to capture more than 51% of the network's blocks, exposing BCH to a 51% attack.

Other mining pools followed suit, leaving Bitcoin Cash's mining network security at multi-year lows relative to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash saw its hashrate drop dramatically following yesterday’s halving, bringing its network security to all-time lows. Even the mining pool operated by Roger Ver, one of the main figureheads behind the coin, almost entirely stopped mining BCH.

Halving Catastrophic for BCH Security

Bitcoin Cash, one of Bitcoin’s most popular forks, went through its first halving yesterday. This took the mining reward from 12.5 to 6.25 BCH, about $3,200 to $1,600, every 10 minutes. Though some expected the coin’s price to react strongly to the event, prices actually rose leading up to the halving, increasing by over 17% since April 5.

Miners on the network, however, showed a much different reaction. Almost immediately after the network hit block 630,000, there was a 109-minute gap between blocks. This is 10x the normal 10-minute block time before the network adjusted the mining difficulty. As a consequence, transactions on the network ground to a halt during that time.

Data shows this was a direct result of the network’s hashrate drop, a consequence of fewer dollars allocated to mining. According to data from CoinWarz, the hashrate on the Bitcoin Cash network dropped from four exahashes per second on April 8 to below one exahash the following day. A startling reduction.

Even Roger Ver Stopped Mining

Several sources indicate that the BCH hashrate could have dropped further if it hadn’t been for some mining pools operating at a loss to maintain the network. There is speculation that BTC.com, the largest mining pool on the Bitcoin Cash network operated by hardware manufacturer Bitmain, is responsible for the majority of the hashrate.

Earlier today, data from Blockchair showed that BTC.com mined 20 out of 36 blocks produced since the halving, or 56% of the blocks. This puts the network at risk of a 51% attack, should the pool collude with another operator.

Other major mining pools also saw drastic hashrate reductions commensurate with BTC.com’s new dominance. Mining pools AntPool and Poolin saw a 65% and 44% drop in hashrate, respectively. Data also shows that Bitcoin.com, one of the most prominent mining pools on the network, has also been operating at a significant loss.

The pool, which is operated by the Bitcoin Cash exchange and corresponding educational website, has seen its hashrate drop by over 92% in the past 24 hours. It seems that even its CEO Roger Ver, the former Bitcoin evangelist turned Bitcoin Cash promoter, is finding it hard to keep his mining operations going in the wake of such a drastic reward reduction.

We are yet to see whether the huge losses in hashrate will continue or will the network be able to see some sort of stabilization in the following weeks. Needless to say, the uncertainty poses significant risks for BCH holders.

In 24 charts, CoinDesk Research shows what happened to crypto assets in Q1 2020 and examines what may emerge in the future. Download our Q1 analysis here, and join us on April 15 for a webinar discussing our findings and other relevant cryptocurrency research.

The CoinDesk Quarterly Review provides research-based insights on how the narrative has changed for blue-chips such as bitcoin and ether. We look at which assets outperformed on returns, and how the participants in crypto markets are shifting in the wake of Q1’s defining event, the March 12 plunge.

Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative grew up in a “bull market in everything.” Bitcoin as gold 2.0, a hedge against inflation and a safe haven in an eventual crash, was a meme investors readily understood.

Now, we’ve seen an economic crisis cause dislocation in crypto markets and push bitcoin’s price downward in tandem with stocks. Gold and Treasury bonds appeared to have failed to live up to “safe haven” expectations. If gold’s narrative is being debated, do we still know what “digital gold” means? At the very least, the events of the past month have put to rest the notion that bitcoin today can be a “haven.”

Q1 crypto analysis: Chart showing bitcoin returns vs S&P, gold and oil

How March 12 shook crypto markets, and how it didn't

The crash shook participants in crypto markets. Open interest in bitcoin futures and perpetual swaps fell off a cliff in March. These markets are used by traders large and small to speculate on bitcoin’s price, and as a temporary hedge against positions in the spot market. Futures volume spiked and settled at a higher baseline, as it did in spot markets. The increased activity is taking place in a shrunken market. About $1.6 billion of traders’ positions were liquidated over two days in March. The sharks are eating each other in a smaller pool, as it were.

At the very least, the events of the past month have put to rest the notion that bitcoin today can be a “haven.”

Bitcoin’s long-term holdings, however, remained unmoved. “Hodlwaves” use Bitcoin timestamps known as UTXOs to measure how long each bitcoin has been held. Tracking time between transactions is a useful measure of long-term “buy-and-hold” activity. That activity is consistent with bitcoin’s use case as “digital gold,” a putative store-of-value. Note that long-term holdings (180 days or more) did not change perceptibly during the March 12 crash. Balances held between 90 days and 180 days shifted abruptly. Were bitcoin sellers concentrated among three- to six-month holders? Or were exchange balances, which shifted on these dates, concentrated in that band?

Some of bitcoin’s long-term holders are surely hoping in time it will prove itself as a haven or store of value. But events such as the March crash open the door to new narratives. The flagship crypto asset’s next meme will set the adoption curve for verifiably scarce digital assets. Will payments re-emerge as an avenue to adoption?

Since launch, the number of computers running the Lightning Network has increased on average 53 percent every quarter. Lightning is a “layer two” payments system built on top of the Bitcoin network. The value held within Lightning payment channels has also increased.

New importance for bitcoin and ethereum technical road maps

It’s possible a new user adoption narrative will be something quite different from what long-term investors in bitcoin have contemplated to date. Will Bitcoin developers add capabilities — like Schnorr signatures, with their privacy and programmability — that lead to its adoption as digital financial infrastructure?

The technical road map emerges from Q1 2020 with increased importance for ethereum, as well. Ether evangelists have spread the meme “ETH is money” in the belief that it has potential as the base currency of a decentralized, digital banking system, dubbed “decentralized finance” or “DeFi.” The failure of flagship DeFi systems during the March 12 crash have raised questions about that narrative. Now more than ever it seems to be dependent on a relatively uncertain road map for “ETH 2.0,” an improvement designed to allow more transaction throughput.

On March 12, total ETH locked in DeFi applications increased as expected, then crashed amid a crisis in DeFi’s programmatic governance. If “ETH is money,” we’d expect to see the amount locked in DeFi and the ETH price grow in tandem, long-term. For the near term, a recovery to previous levels would indicate a restoration of confidence in DeFi systems.

Fold founder Will Reeves said an email poll of roughly 30,000 Fold users revealed 90 percent said they would “switch spending away from their existing card” for a card with bitcoin (BTC) rewards for dollars spent. The waiting list is now open for the Fold card that starts shipping in July.

“You manage everything within [the Fold app], your card details, your rewards,” Reeves said in an interview. “We’re able to send out to your [bitcoin] wallet of choice. … You don’t have to wait to accrue too much of it [bitcoin].”

There are already several companies offering Visa cards so bitcoiners can spend cryptocurrency as dollars, including Coinbase, and options for shopping on desktop with most cards for bitcoin rewards, with the browser-plugin Lolli.

Both Lolli and Fold App have seen a dramatic increase in online shopping for essentials and home equipment since the coronavirus crisis hit the United States. Fold users are buying more gift cards for Amazon and Target, while Lolli shoppers are spending more at Sam’s Club, Vitacost, Best Buy and Newegg, according to Lolli’s head of communications, Aubrey Strobel.

“We’ve seen an uptick in volume the entire month,” Reeves said of the 24,000 transactions by Fold users in Q1 2020. That represents a 110 percent increase over Q4 2019, with “thousands of new users.” Across the board, companies that help retail users accrue bitcoin have generally performed well during the broader market turndown.

The goal of this new card is to “meet consumers where they’re at,” Reeves said, “giving users the ability to accrue and use bitcoin in their daily lives.”

Earning, not spending

Fold investor Meltem Demirors once owned one of the first bitcoin-affiliated cards, a Shift debit card for spending bitcoin. She said Fold’s new product is unique because the card enables people to earn rather than spend bitcoin.

“The capital gains [taxes] for [spending] are just such a pain,” Demirors said. “I’ve been spending [dollars] nonstop with Fold.”

Users can already shop directly through the app and earn rewards for using the Lightning Network option, for example, while they wait for the Visa program to roll out later this year. Users can choose to spend bitcoin with this feature, but most seem to prefer spending dollars for bitcoin rewards. The average transaction size in Q1 2020 was $55, according to Reeves.

Fold certainly won’t be the last team to explore bitcoin-related credit cards. When asked if the exchange Kraken was exploring a Visa card program like Coinbase or Fold, Kraken bitcoin strategist Pierre Rochard answered, “We’re always looking to better serve our customers.”

NFL player and Fold investor Russell Okung said in a press release the Fold Visa card now “represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.” In the press release, Visa Global Head of Fintech Terry Angelos said Fold joined a program that offers “unprecedented access to Visa experts, technology, and resources.”","Bitcoin and ether fell slightly Thursday as traditional markets climbed on additional stimulus measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England.

In the traditional markets, Asia’s Nikkei 225 index closed flat, down a miniscule 0.04 percent. Japan central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Thursday that uncertainty about his country’s economic outlook is “extremely high.”

Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day up 2.9 percent as the Bank of England extended an existing agreement to bankroll the U.K. economy.

In the U.S., the S&P 500 closed New York’s trading day up 1.4 percent. The Federal Reserve announced new stimulus measures to contain the economic fallout from the continuing coronavirus pandemic.

The central bank rolled out a program worth $2.3 trillion, including a “Main Street Lending Fund” of $600 billion to offer support to small and medium-sized businesses, and $500 billion in lending to states and municipalities.

The Fed also expanded the size and scope of the Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to support as much as $850 billion in credit.

After the Fed announced the new measures, bitcoin rebounded from an intraday low of $7,100, quickly reversing a steep decline. It’s currently trading in a sideways range around the $7,200 level.

Stocks, particularly in the U.S., are seeing gains this week. But there’s some doubt whether this can last. “U.S. stocks will still be in a very precarious situation in April as the ongoing pandemic remains far from over,” said Toby Wu, a senior analyst for multi-asset brokerage eToro.

Since taking a beating in mid-March, bitcoin had been steadily climbing, driven by predictions that new-money injections from governments and central banks around the world would eventually spur inflation. Bitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation and many analysts say it will benefit one way or another from the unconventional methods adopted by the Fed to combat the coronavirus-led slowdown. If it’s a risk asset, as skeptics see it, bitcoin should rise along with other high-yielding instruments; if it’s truly the haven adherents claim it to be, it should attract investment for that reason.

Perhaps supporting inflationary concerns, foreign exchange traders dumped the U.S. dollar Thursday, sending the dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against other major currencies, down to 99.50 from 100.00. Elsewhere, gold, a classic haven asset and hedge against inflation, is currently trading up at 2.4 percent.

So why isn’t the bellwether cryptocurrency soaring on the latest intervention announcements? Profit-taking was the name of the game Thursday, market participants said.

“Crypto should be higher based on those large moves in conventional markets. However, we have seen net selling today. Traders are taking profit,” said Max Boonen, CEO of B2C2, a London-based over-the-counter (OTC) market maker.

This selling seems to be keeping bitcoin stuck in the $7,200 range.

“The recent weeks’ rally appears to have temporarily stalled at about $7,400, but the bullish outlook for bitcoin remains intact over the next one to 12 months,” said Greg Cipolaro, cofounder of Digital Asset Research, a cryptocurrency-analysis firm.","A closed-end fund that aims to provide investors with exposure to bitcoin in a regulated asset class has listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).

Canadian investment manager 3iQ said The Bitcoin Fund, for which it originally filed a prospectus back in October, began trading on the TSX on Thursday.

The fund works along the same lines as an exchange-traded product (ETP): investors purchase shares in the fund and receive exposure to changes in the underlying assets price over time. It tracks the bitcoin (BTC) price using an index feed co-developed by MV Index Solutions (MVIS), a VanEck Europe subsidiary, and cryptocurrency market data provider CryptoCompare.

The fund is split into two types of shares, Class A, aimed at all types of investors, and Class F for institutions. Only Class A shars are being listed on the Toronto exchange. 3iQ president and CEO Fred Pye told CoinDesk the total value of Class A shares comes to approximately $14 million.

As with other ETPs, the key attraction is investors who either can’t or won’t buy the underlying asset can still add bitcoin to their portfolios. Traditional investors can also use the fund as a vehicle to become more familiar with the asset class.

Speaking on Thursday’s news, MVIS Managing Director Thomas Kettner said listing on a mainstream exchange would “help to strengthen the status of digital assets as an asset class.”

3iQ said it spent more than three years in dialogue with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) before receiving approval for The Bitcoin Fund. Connor Loewen, 3iQ’s cryptocurrency analyst, said the fund decided to list in Toronto because it is already regulated in Canada.

TSX is the largest and most active stock exchange in Canada. Although other exchanges have also listed cryptocurrency companies, Toronto has made a cottage industry out of it. Bitcoin mining group Hut8 and crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital are both listed there; so, too, are crypto products such as the Horizon “blockchain ETF,” which began trading back in 2018.","Governments around the world are careening toward a period of dramatic spending.

The U.S. Federal Reserve announced another $2.3 trillion in lending programs on Thursday to stabilize America’s coronavirus-stricken economy. The Bank of England announced it would likely extend billions of pounds to directly finance the government’s crisis response.

All this inspires inflation concerns around the globe, which appear to be driving demand for bitcoin (BTC) in some corners.

“The non-stop quantitative easing process will finally impact the mid-term and long-term market,” said Danny Deng, a leading member of both the China Blockchain Application Center and the National Internet Finance Association of China. “Bitcoin is designed for this kind of situation. So I’m optimistic about bitcoin’s future.”

China is also expected to announce a stimulus package of its own. Deng said he expects the People’s Bank of China to use a digital currency to distribute a stimulus package, which he sees as a complementary catalyst to the bitcoin mining industry.

While central banks continue printing money, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The halving of bitcoin miners’ block rewards is scheduled for May in what some are calling an act of quantitative tightening.

Broadly speaking, dozens of nations are reevaluating which currencies and industries they depend on. Bitcoin fits into this broader spectrum as some nations with strong central governments, like China, shore up hard assets and digital infrastructure. Meanwhile, there has been a surge in retail crypto investors from nations with unstable currencies, such as Argentina and Russia.

“We see that interest in cryptocurrencies has grown significantly in Russia … due to the economic situation in the country,” said Gleb Kostarev, Binance’s head of operations in Russia. “The ruble has tumbled a lot in 2020. In addition, authorities are introducing a new tax on income from bank deposits from next year, which encourages people to withdraw funds from banks.”

Bitcoin is hardly the most important asset in the broader economic turndown. However, recent bitcoin trends highlight the local impact of global developments. In places where distrust of banks historically runs high, many households now consider bitcoin among the assets they trust more than the local fiat currency.

Speculator's market

Some critics may see decline in bitcoin’s wild volatility during the start of the coronavirus economic crisis, including what crypto traders called Black Thursday.

But the institutional sell-off and subsequent trading rush stimulated more diverse distribution, usage and liquidity options, all while making crypto companies a hefty profit.

Marius Reitz, general manager at the African crypto exchange Luno, said there was a 25 percent increase in new signups during Q1 2020 compared to Q4 2019. This includes “thousands” of new users from Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Uganda. He added there was a 100 percent increase in trading across the continent.

“People saw an opportunity to recover some of their earlier [traditional market] losses in bitcoin,” Reitz said. “It’s very much still a speculator’s market.”

Reitz said March witnessed a stronger correlation between gold and bitcoin trades in African markets as well. Overall, it appears bitcoin distribution diversified during the coronavirus downturn.

According to the asset manager and research firm Bitwise, nearly all exchanges experienced an increase in volume during March. North American exchanges including Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini saw the most growth in trading volumes. Kraken’s bitcoin strategist, Pierre Rochard, said the exchange saw a 300 percent increase in new users getting verified in March, compared to the previous month.

“These are new users who didn’t have any crypto beforehand,” Rochard said.

Fiat-denominated prices aren’t the only way to measure bitcoin’s performance. The number of active bitcoin wallet addresses is now comparable to metrics during the sky-high prices of September 2017, according to Coin Metrics, which estimated roughly 770,915 active accounts on March 30, 2020 compared to 718,184 on Sept. 29, 2017.

Although the price of bitcoin briefly dropped 40 percent, down from $9,160 in early March, it recovered to roughly $7,300 as of press time. As such, Luno’s Reitz said bitcoin suffered less of an impact, and recovered faster, than many other asset classes.

Institutions that sold off in early March quickly bought back in, according to Diogo Monica, co-founder of crypto custody firm Anchorage. Plus, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said his custody startup saw such high demand for bullish loans in March that he will double the size of the team handling crypto loans. Exchanges and custodians are actually making more profit during the recession.

When the market crashed, speculative crypto trading and demand for custody options soared. Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier said hardware wallet sales saw “double-digit growth” in Q1 2020 compared to the same time last year, with sales still accelerating.

“We are increasing our hardware [wallet] production as a result,” Gauthier added.

As speculative traders rush in, Latin Americans increasingly turn to bitcoin for savings and loans.

Latin America

“The main usage is to save. … People are seeking safety,” said Ripio CEO Sebastian Serrano, whose Latin American company offers both crypto loans and an exchange. “Argentina was on the brink of default and that happened on Sunday.”

Argentina isn’t the only country to default, either. Lebanon, Ecuador and Venezuela are also on the brink. Bitcoiners in Lebanon often focus on savings because they, like Latin Americans, share a distrust in banks.

Cryptobuyer CEO Jorge Luis Farias said orders for crypto point-of-sale (POS) devices doubled in March, mostly in Venezuela. He’s also shipping three new bitcoin ATMs to Chile, where the local currency hit a historic low in March.

Subsequently, by the first week of April, Chilean activity on LocalBitcoins reached an all-time high of $371,063.

“More people are looking for options to receive payments,” Farias said on April 7. “We received 100 new [POS device] requests only last week.”

According to fellow Venezuelan expatriate Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of the crypto loan startup Ledn, Mexican and Argentinian users are driving growth on his platform with bitcoin savings accounts. Even including bitcoin-collateralized loans for dollars or stablecoins, Latin Americans now make up 60 percent of new Ledn user accounts in 2020, he said, compared to around 16 percent from North America. His user base, with “thousands” of people, doubled over the last six months.

“I think the economic situation has to do with it, in Argentina and Mexico. Mexico had a run-up in exchange-rate disparity,” Bartolomeo said. “We expect to see a lot of demand from Latin America to save in options that aren’t their local currency.”

If the rate of bitcoin savings and reliable loans remain steady throughout the broader economic crisis, that may arguably be a more bullish signal than fiat-denominated price increases.

Asian alliance

Meanwhile, several Asian nations are reacting to the recession by increasing their economic interdependence.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization with China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan agreed in March to work with local currencies, instead of U.S. dollars, when conducting bilateral trade and issuing bonds. Deng said the Chinese government aims to make its currency regional tender, “then a global currency” like dollars.

“China’s national digital currency will accelerate this process,” he added.

The crypto industry could provide the infrastructure for this distribution. Kazakhstani entrepreneur Tilektes Adambekov said in April he is still working to launch a regional crypto exchange that will eventually include “fiat trading and security tokens,” although these aren’t plans specifically focused on China’s digital currency.

“This region will accommodate global initiatives under the ‘Belt and Road’ global development strategy,” Adambekov said during a meeting with Chinese business associates in January.

As for bitcoin itself, traders from the above-mentioned markets sometimes liquidate their crypto by investing in real estate, especially now that oil and bond markets are highly volatile.

Middle East

Gold, oil and real estate investments appear to increase, along with bitcoin transactions, when stocks and bonds dip.

Arms & McGregor International Realty CEO Makram Hani said his company is working to close a Dubai property purchase, worth $140 million, using multiple cryptocurrencies from a single Asian buyer.

Out of the hundreds of prospective customers who expressed interest in potentially buying real estate with cryptocurrency, Hani said the most popular property locations are Dubai, London and Berlin. It appears bitcoiners in nations with increased surveillance may be seeking a liquidity hedge with traditional assets, while others in the Middle East are willing to accept large amounts of cryptocurrency.

“We have seen a significant growth in real estate transactions that have been paid for, in one way or another, with funds originating as bitcoin or other currencies,” Hani said.

Rain co-founder Yehia Badawy, who also serves bitcoiners in Dubai via his Bahrain-based exchange, said trading volumes increased 200 percent from January to March 2020, with 34 percent more new user signups driven by “high-volume retail.”

“People are still trying to figure out how permanent the [economic] changes will be,” Badawy said.

Due to the oil market slump, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have struggled to retain investor confidence in their debts. The oil market collapse could have more dire impacts on weaker states like Lebanon and Iraq, which were already saddled with crippling foreign debts before the pandemic hit.

Mikhail Kholodov, an oil market expert at MOL-Russ LLC, described the global market these days as “all speculation” and “hot money in a casino-like arrangement” that won’t regain balance “anytime soon.”

When spooked investors diversify, some now rank bitcoin alongside tangible investments like gold or real estate."
2020-04-10,"Major cryptocurrency markets fell 7 percent over the past 24 hours, with bitcoin (BTC) retreating below $7,000.

While traditional stocks saw modest gains during early trading hours Friday, the crypto market shed more than $13 billion over the past 24 hours, according to Nomics. Most large-cap cryptos fell more than 8 percent in that time period, with BTC’s 6.8 percent dip being the only exception.

The sell-off appears to have begun early UTC Friday.

According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency fell from about $7,300 at 01:00 UTC Friday to just above $6,800 as of press time, losing nearly $500 over 14 hours.

“Given some of the abruptness of the overnight move, it suggests that some larger holders were inclined to take profits at these relatively favorable prices,” David Nuelle, managing director of Hehmeyer Trading + Investments, told CoinDesk. “Other than that, I don’t see anything that would precipitate the market move.”

Still, Nuelle called bitcoin’s recovery from mid-March lows of roughly $4,100 “pretty impressive.”

“With other markets closed and it being a U.S. holiday, the crypto markets are generally feeling less liquid,” CMS Holdings Partner Bobby Cho told CoinDesk. “I don’t see this being an issue with crypto fundamentals, rather, short-term market liquidity issues.”

In contrast to the crypto markets, traditional stock markets capped largely positive weeks. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Index saw major gains in the last four days of trading (markets were closed Friday for the Easter holiday), despite the economic hit caused by record job losses.

The U.S. saw 10 percent of its workforce laid off over a three-week period as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Jobless claims grew 6.6 million on Thursday, for a total of 16 million, according to CNBC.

Economies worldwide are bracing for an economic shock due to the pandemic. Germany and France are already seeing their economies slide into a recession, the New York Times reported Thursday.","The Fed opening the floodgates to unlimited standing quantitative easing paired with a $6 trillion stimulus package is an unprecedented event. It’s the most heavy-handed intervention by the Fed to date. For many crypto proponents, it is a rallying cry amid an interventionist monetary policy reminiscent of the 2008 environment that led to the release of the Bitcoin (BTC) whitepaper by its anonymous founder.

The giant stimulus package equates to roughly 28% of the United States’ 2019 GDP, arriving while credit markets are in flux and bond yields are trending toward zero. As the sharpest decline in American history, current market shock to the S&P 500 may only be a byproduct of unwinding leveraged positions from major asset managers such as risk-parity funds and rules-based funds.

The negative impact of COVID-19 on the real economy still looms over the horizon. Unemployment rates are surging so fast that the U.S. Labor Department has actually asked states to postpone the release of their numbers to temper negative market sentiment.

Had anyone presented the current situation to a crypto enthusiast in December, they likely would have said that they couldn’t have imagined a scenario more conducive to crypto’s macro narrative. That scenario may not be all sunshine and rainbows, though.

An opportune moment

We may be witnessing a fundamental shift in legacy market sentiment — specifically, the cozy relationship between the government and corporations. The stimulus package revealed that corporations were woefully unprepared for any type of supply/demand shock and had abused low-interest loan rates to buy back their own shares.

Nonetheless, most corporations are being bailed out along with major fund managers to the tune of the Fed and Treasury Department’s $4.25 trillion standing lending facility. In comparison, small businesses are left with a meager $300 billion trough.

Struggling Americans, increasingly without jobs while their bills are piling up, only receive a paltry $1,200 check — a reality more suggestive of corporate socialism, according to Nassim Taleb.

Bitcoiners were largely caught up in a “safe-haven” narrative for the legacy cryptocurrency while the S&P 500 tumbled and panic reigned over credit markets. However, Bitcoin (BTC) fared just as poorly, as the assets in virtually every market were sold off in unison — with the crypto market structure effectively breaking on March 12 and 13.

Despite this, Bitcoin has climbed back without stimulus injections, only posting a 10% price drop for the first quarter of 2020.

Bitcoin’s safe-haven narrative may have taken a hit during the last month, but this is precisely the moment it was created for. Add in a rising generation of Millennial investors who have now watched the legacy system fail spectacularly twice, and the picture of a stark opportunity for crypto to prevail among the public begins to crystalize.

And there are already some encouraging signs.

Early indications of a positive impact

The shuttering of local businesses has strained employees and small businesses to a tenuous level. Interestingly, cannabis shops have been deemed “essential” in states like Colorado, highlighting a unique development.

It’s no secret that cannabis companies have struggled to maintain consistent banking relationships, even despite the plant’s legal status in California and Colorado.

This is where technology could provide a useful redundancy for merchants. For example, consumers can purchase goods at a cannabis store using Bitcoin’s lightning network without actually interacting with the network’s interface. Instead, user bank accounts are debited cash as if the purchase had been made with a debit card.

The larger context of wielding crypto payments for redundancies can apply to financial hedges, censorship-resistance and access to liquidity when the banking system is in flux. Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) may seem, ironically, a better alternative to storing U.S. dollars in a bank account, as Bank of America recently instituted withdrawal limits and is reportedly hassling clients to not tap into their full credit lines.

Meanwhile, stablecoin supplies are swelling to historic levels.

It’s hard to pinpoint precisely why, but some observations indicate that either this may be a byproduct of increasing OTC desk operational demand, stablecoins are a venue for increasing exposure to the most in-demand asset right now (USD), or people are merely hedging positions in the crypto market — which is actually very liquid and has a topology similar to the FX market.

It may sound odd to turn to crypto during financial turmoil, but the industry has evolved to a more sophisticated level than its more immature former versions.

As a whole, the crypto industry is markedly different than when mainstream investors flocked to the initial coin offering mania of 2017. User interface and experience have drastically improved, liquidity is much better, analytics has progressed substantially, derivatives are booming, and the mining sector is industrializing.

Investors surveying the landscape now will likely be impressed with the progress if they had left in early 2018, when SegWit was barely adopted and the hype was untenable. Coinbase even revealed that retail investors comprised a bulk of the buyers when the Bitcoin price briefly dipped under $4,000 in mid-March.

The more seasoned crypto environment is also supported by a slew of projects outside of Bitcoin explicitly.

Part of the original stimulus bill (which was eventually slashed) included language for a digital dollar. A purely digital fiat currency has dangerous implications on financial privacy, and crypto can help provide an avenue for people nervous about the incremental privacy intrusions being made by their government. However, a financial ecosystem based on simple private transactions between counterparties is insufficient.

In this context, commercial services can be built using blockchain, where app and DApp users can interact with services privately — whether transacting in stablecoins, sharing location data or sharing specific personal data within the usual experience of any standard mobile app on their phone.

Beyond privacy, some projects are designed to alleviate some of the scaling burdens of decentralized finance on Ethereum — a necessity for meaningful DeFi adoption — but Ethereum desperately needs scaling solutions for its DeFi platforms, with MakerDAO nearly shattering following the steep drop in Ether’s price.

But in crises like COVID-19, when there is more at stake than financial outcomes, taking a thoughtful approach in solidarity with the ongoing quarantine and stay-at-home orders is necessary. Sometimes, that means canceling events at massive expense to projects or publications, such as Maxonrow rescheduling its inaugural Hackathon to Factory Berlin on Oct. 3.

The point is that everyone is struggling amid an unprecedented global crisis. From a financial outlook, the situation is favorable for crypto, but first, projects and crypto assets need to weather the economic storm ahead. Then, maybe the infrastructure progress and early indications of blossoming adoption will follow.

Crypto’s foundation is built upon an ever-reducing trust in the legacy financial system. That system has exposed its faults once again, and while there is still a ways to go for the broader crypto industry to appeal to the mainstream, the current macro narrative has never been more conducive to the sector’s eventual success.

Now, it’s about seizing that opportunity.

Research out Friday shows profit made through cryptocurrency scams has dropped considerably since the start of the year. On a seven-day moving average, revenue earned by scammers plummeted from $800,000 worth of crypto in the middle of January to below $300,000 at the beginning of April – almost entirely due to the dramatic market drop earlier this year.

Researchers initially thought the coronavirus might make people less susceptible to scams. But they found that just as many people were being affected. The number of individual transfers – the number of payments sent to scammers – actually hit a year-to-date high at the start of April.

What Chainalysis concluded was that the major sell-off in cryptocurrencies sparked by the coronavirus – total market cap fell by $100 billion in mid-March, according to CoinGecko – had a knock-on effect on scammers’ revenue.

Source: Chainalysis

“We believe scammers are still receiving those same payments from roughly the same number of victims per month. The payments are just worth less now due to cryptocurrency price drops,” Chainalysis said in its report.

“In short, while COVID-19 is providing phishing and blackmail scammers with new fraudulent stories to entice victims, the cryptocurrency price drops spurred by the pandemic have drastically reduced the revenue of the Ponzi schemes and investment scams that make up most cryptocurrency scamming activity.”","It has been an incredibly volatile year for Chainlink, with the highly bullish crypto rocketing to fresh all-time highs in early-March before it lost its momentum and found itself caught within a firm downtrend that led it to erase some of its recent gains.

It is important to note that the crypto is still trading up nearly 100% from where it started the year, and it could be positioned to see further upside in the days and weeks ahead, with one analyst noting that it could even rally another 100% from its current price levels.

Despite this, the crypto is pushing up against a key resistance region, and analysts are noting that the selling pressure here could be enough to put a temporary end to its recent uptrend.

Chainlink Closes Below Key Resistance as Crypto Market Declines

At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading down over 11% at its current price of $3.02, which marks a notable decline from daily highs of $3.45 that were set yesterday.

The crypto saw some intense bullishness this week, rallying from lows of $2.25 to highs at $3.45 set yesterday, with this bullishness coming about in tandem with that seen by Bitcoin.

The recent decline from these highs has led Chainlink to close its daily candle below a key support level, which is a bear-favoring that could lead the cryptocurrency to see a near-term retrace in the days and weeks ahead.

Josh Rager – a prominent crypto analyst – spoke about this daily close below resistance in a recent tweet, noting that a failure for BTC to push higher will likely be a grave sign for LINK in the near-term.

“LINK update: From last chart, still potential to hit up at $3.86 but unfortunately LINK did not get the daily close we were looking for. Closed below the resistance level on the 1D. Hopefully, if BTC can push up, this will be enough to push LINK, if not, could see a retrace here,” he noted.

LINK Could Rally 100% Or More If It Builds Confluence With BTC

Another popular analyst on Twitter noted that LINK’s confluence with Bitcoin sits within the $6.00 region, meaning a visit to this level could be seen if the aggregated crypto market shifts back into bull’s favor.

“Chainlink: Respecting the $3.40 quite nicely here. Would be looking for a short term scalp if we make another dip towards $2.80 (confluent with BTC at $6.750-6.800). Not a long term buy there,” he noted.

In the near-term, although a 100% rally may seem far-fetched, it is imperative to keep in mind that the crypto does tend to move in parabolic cycles, with its rise seen this week potentially marking the start of a much bigger movement.

Due to the latest market volatility in crypto markets, many Bitcoin exchanges and fiat on-ramps have experienced high volumes.

Critically, new users have made up the bulk of this volume. But beyond speculating on top coins, what else will these budding enthusiasts be able to do with their digital assets?

Various crypto wallets, exchanges, and fiat on-ramps have all reported tremendous volumes over the past few weeks. For those unaware, the price of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, dropped from $7,900 to $3,800 in just a few hours on Mar. 12.

In the wake of the crash, Coinbase, a top American crypto platform for new users, broke various traffic and volume records as users either fled positions or bought the dip. Over the 48 hours during the crash and bottom, the firm reported $2 billion in transactions.

Other top exchanges like OKEx and Binance also recorded substantial volumes.

After exchanges, fiat-to-crypto services like MoonPay enjoyed an uptick in volume. Ivan Soto-Wright, MoonPay’s founder and CEO, told Crypto Briefing that:

“Total retail volumes across MoonPay and our network of partner exchanges, wallets, and decentralized applications are up over 80% month-to-month as of the end of March.”

The white-label solution allows anyone within the crypto ecosystem to equip a fiat on-ramp. Notable partners include KyberSwap, ZenGo, Edge, CoinPaprika, and many others. As part of the latest rise in activity, MoonPay is also adding new members to its team.

On Apr. 9, the team announced the inclusion of Nils Puhlman, the former chief trust and security officer of cloud services platform, Twilio. Puhlman will serve as a security advisor for MoonPay to help boost the team’s security measures as they grow.

The team has turned its attention to security since MoonPay’s involvement in IOTA’s latest Trinity Wallet breach.

High volumes on Coinbase and MoonPay indicate that the crypto community offers much in the way of turning boring fiat into shiny internet money.

On making it easy to onboard new users, Soto-Wright said:

“MoonPay is targeted at first-time users of crypto of all ages and geographies. Our mission is to make cryptocurrencies accessible to a wider audience, and that starts with simplifying the user journey.”

But after onboarding this demographic, getting new users to spend their Bitcoin at various merchants is proving much more difficult.

Encouraging Point of Sale Adoption

With only a few exceptions, merchant adoption has shown far less promise than user adoption.

The exception to this, of course, has been unique Bitcoin rewards services like Fold and Lolli. Users shopping at top retailers like Lowe’s and Starbucks can pay in fiat and earn cashback in BTC when using either platform.

And while the list of merchants who accept crypto grows, sleek point-of-sale infrastructure lags. Breez, a Lightning Network-enabled wallet provider, is trying to change that.

The team behind Breez released “the first mobile, non-custodial, Lightning-only Point-of-Sale” on Mar. 27. In making Lightning payments easy for merchants, all of the new users who have recently joined crypto will hopefully have new merchants to facilitate spending.

In a post announcing the development, the team wrote:

“The rise of Lightning will be a combination of citizen-consumers losing patience with fiat, and coffee shops, Ubers, gas/charging stations, and even major online retailers standing ready with an alternative. By giving merchants what they need, we’re giving users what they want.”

But beyond tackling the technical challenges of implementing Lightning at scale, companies like Breez will also be battling Bitcoin’s most unpopular narrative.

Despite Satoshi Nakamoto’s claims to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, many entering the industry view Bitcoin as a purely speculative instrument. Marcus Swanepoel, the CEO of another crypto on-ramp called Luno, told CNBC that the majority of users on his platform are speculators. He said:

“I would put roughly 90% into the category of investments [and] speculation…and another 10% would be for transactions.”

If users don’t view Bitcoin as a means of payment, its no wonder that there are fewer companies building crypto merchant services than those building on-ramps.

But for an industry that’s barely a decade old, that might be good enough for now.","Bitcoin

Bitcoin is up by a small 2% this week after suffering a major setback when it dropped by 5.5% in today’s trading session. The cryptocurrency had surged from the $6,800 level last Friday to reach as high as $6,400 at the start of this week.

However, in today’s trading, Bitcoin fell by over 5% to drop back into the $6,800 support level. It also found added support at the previous rising trend line.

If Bitcoin drops back beneath $6,800, additional support lies at $6,600, $6,400, $6,200, and $6,000.

On the other side, if it can rebound from $6,800, resistance lies at $7,000, $7,200 (bearish .5 Fib Retracement), and $7,400. Beyond $7,400, added resistance lies at $7,700 (100-days EMA) and $8,000 (200-days EMA & bearish .618 Fib Retracement).

Ethereum

Ethereum managed to break above the previous $145 resistance level this week as it surged by a total of 23% to reach the resistance at $175, which is provided by the 100-days EMA.

It struggled to break this resistance and since dropped by 7.2% today to reach the current trading level at $158. This brings the total 7-day price movement to +10.5%.

From below, the first level of support lies at $155 (short term .382 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, added support is located at $150 (.5 Fib Retracement), $144 (.618 Fib Retracement), and $140. The support at $140 is further bolstered by a rising support trend line.

Alternatively, if the bulls rebound from $155, resistance is located at $165 (bearish .382 Fib Retracement), $175 (100-days EMA), and $180.

Against Bitcoin, ETH also surged by a total of 12% as it managed to break above the previous 0.021 BTC resistance to climb as high as 0.0235 BTC before reversing. It has since dropped lower but is resting at support at 0.0229 BTC provided by a .236 Fib Retracement.

If the sellers push lower, support lies at 0.0225 (.382 Fib Retracement), 0.022 BTC, and 0.0215 BTC (.618 Fib Retracement).

On the other side, if they can push higher, resistance lies at 0.0235 BTC, 0.0245 BTC (bearish .618 Fib Retracement), and 0.025 BTC.

Ripple

XRP dropped by a total of 6% today as the cryptocurrency failed to make ground above the $0.20 resistance level. It had climbed by a total of 14% throughout the week to reach $0.20, but today’s price decline brought the 7-day price to a small 4%.

XRP is now trading at support provided by the rising support trend line at $0.182.

If the sellers break this rising trend line, support is expected at $0.171, $0.16, and $0.147.

On the other hand, if they can rebound from here, resistance lies at $0.191, $0.20, and $0.21 (100-days EMA). Above this, added resistance is found at $0.217 and $0.24 (200-days EMA).

Against Bitcoin, XRP rebounded from the .5 Fib Retracement support at 2620 SAT. It went on to climb as high as 2750 SAT but failed to overcome the resistance here provided by a 100-days EMA and a falling trend line.

From below, the first level of support lies at 2710 SAT. Beneath this, support lies at 2680 SAT (.382 Fib Retracement), 2650 SAT, 2620 SAT (.5 Fib Retracement), and 2560 SAT.

Alternatively, if the bulls can break the 100-days EMA, resistance lies at 2800 SAT, 2850 SAT, and 2900 SAT.

Waves

WAVES witnessed a sharp 8.5% price hike over the past week as the cryptocurrency climbed above $1.05. It is still trapped within a rising price channel and must break this for a strong bullish run to form.

From above, the first level of resistance beyond the channel lies at $1.10 (200-days EMA. Above this, resistance lies at $1.15 (bearish .5 Fib Retracement), $1.30 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement), and $1.40.

From below, the first level of support lies at $1.00. Beneath this, support lies at $0.95, $0.90, and then the lower boundary of the price channel.

Against Bitcoin, WAVES has also been performing relatively well. The cryptocurrency dropped as low as 13,500 SAT during the week but since rebounded to reach the current 15,200 SAT level, climbing above the 200-days EMA. It still must close above 17,000 SAT for a bullish trend to form.

From above, the first level of strong resistance lies at 16,000 SAT. Above this, resistance lies at 17,000 SAT, 18,000 SAT, and 18,780 SAT.

Alternatively, if the sellers push lower, support lies at 14,000 SAT (200-days EMA). Beneath this, support lies at 13,000 SAT (100-days EMA), 12,700 SAT (.618 Fib Retracement), and 12,000 SAT.

Matic

Matic dropped by a steep 12% today. However, it had increased by a total of 24% during the week to reach a high of $0.014. This brings the total 7-day price increase to a small 4% as it now trades at $0.0119.

If the buyers can regain control and push higher, the first level of resistance lies at $0.14. Above this, resistance lies at $0.15 (100-days EMA), $0.18, and $0.20.

On the other side, the first level of support lies in the rising support trend line. Beneath $0.12, added support lies at $0.01, $0.008, and $0.006.

Against Bitcoin, MATIC developed a strong support level at the 160 SAT price range during the final 2-weeks of March 2020. It went on to climb from here this week to reach as high as 192 SAT but has since dropped to 176 SAT.

From below, the first level of support lies at 165 SAT. Beneath this, support lies at 160 SAT, 150SAT, and 140 SAT.

On the other side, if the buyers can break 192 SAT, resistance lies at 200 SAT (100-days and &200-days EMAs). Above this, added resistance lies at 231 SAT and 251 SAT.","Institutional investors at Fidelity Digital Assets can now trade Bitcoin on the US-based exchange ErisX.

Key Takeaways Chainlink's network is growing at a steady rate with spikes of over 2,000 new addresses in a single day.

Meanwhile, the number of LINK holders is increasing with a linear behavior.

Despite the optimism given by these on-chain metrics, technical indexes estimate that a correction is underway.

Share this article

Chainlink’s network continues to grow despite the financial havoc caused by the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. Different technical indexes show that this altcoin could still go through a bearish impulse before continuing its uptrend.

The Chainlink Network Grows

Throughout the year Chainlink has been characterized for its high levels of volatility. Since January, the decentralized oracle service surged over 1.9x reaching an all-time high of nearly $5 in early March.

Nonetheless, as the global financial meltdown intensified, investors rushed to exchanges to profit from the substantial price increase and to protect their capital from adverse market conditions.

The sell-off saw LINK take a 70% nosedive pushing its price down to $1.5 only nine days after the peak.

Despite the massive drop, Chainlink has been able to recover a big portion of the losses incurred and is currently hovering around $3. In addition, on-chain metrics reveal that its network continues to grow regardless of the global economic turmoil.

IntoTheBlock’s “Daily Active Addresses” model reveals that Chainlink is going through a steady increase in the number of new addresses being created on the network. Network growth continues to reach higher highs each month.

In February, there was a spike of over 2,000 new addresses created in a single day while in March it crossed the 2,500 mark. This fundamental metric seems to be heading to similar heights as it is currently hanging around 2,000 new addresses per day.

Moreover, the number of addresses that have held the token from one to twelve months, which IntoTheBlock defines as “cruisers,” is increasing with a linear behavior.

The data firm maintains that such a parabolic rise can be interpreted as a good sign of faith and trust that investors have shown for this project.

Although these on-chain fundamentals show that Chainlink’s network is growing strong through the current uncertain financial environment, multiple technical indicators estimate that a retracement is underway.

Bearish Momentum on Chainlink’s Horizon

The TD sequential indicator is currently presenting a sell signal in the form of a green nine candlestick on LINK’s 12-hour chart. This bearish formation forecasts a one to four candlesticks correction before the continuation of the uptrend.

A spike in the selling pressure behind this altcoin in combination with a red two candlestick trading below a preceding red one candlestick could serve as confirmation of the pessimistic outlook.

Additionally, a candlestick close below the 200-twelve-hour moving average could trigger an increase in supply that sends Chainlink to look for support around the 50-twelve-hour moving average. This support barrier is currently sitting around $2.5.

Overall Sentiment

Putting aside the high probability of the above-mentioned bearish impulse, the fact that the network continues to grow shows that user adoption is increasing over time.

Brian Quinlivan, Market and Social Media Director at Santiment, believes that network growth is one of the most accurate price “foreshadowers.”

Quinlivan argues that network growth usually leads to price appreciation while declining network growth in most cases indicates a price drop.

Under this premise, the bearish momentum that LINK could go through may represent an opportunity to let sidelined investors back into the market, subsequently, pushing its price back up. Nevertheless, market participants must pay attention to how the global pandemic continues to evolve since it could severely impact the inflow of capital in the crypto market.",
2020-04-11,"Key Takeaways Arthur Hayes believes that the global financial markets are poised for a further downturn that could have a drastic impact on Bitcoin.

Tone Vays, a former Wall Street trader, argues that the current economic environment is perfect for the pioneer cryptocurrency to thrive as a hedging asset.

Different technical patterns show an ambiguous outlook, making the current price levels pivotal for BTC's trend.

Share this article

BitMEX honcho Arthur Hayes thinks $3,000 Bitcoin is realistic given current economic conditions. Tone Vayes, meanwhile, thinks BTC will show its colors as a safe haven. Who’s right?

Signs of a Further Decline

In a recent blog post, Arthur Hayes, CEO at BitMEX, explained that the global financial markets are poised for a further downturn. The former institutional trader maintains that the $2 trillion stimulus package the U.S. Senate passed to provide relief from the havoc caused by the ongoing pandemic may have little to no impact in the stock market.

Although the S&P 500 is up nearly 30% from the recent crash, Hayes believes this bullish impulse represents a dead cat bounce. He now expects a steeper decline across all major economies, bleeding over into the crypto markets.

“As the SPX rolls over and tests 2,000 expect all asset classes to puke again. As violent as the Q1 collapse in asset values was, we have almost 100 years of imbalances to unwind the ancien régime,” said Hayes.

The former Deutsche Bank market-maker affirmed that Bitcoin could retest the $3,000 price level before it is forced to rebound sharply and end the year at around $20,000.

Given the current state of commotion around the planet, the chances of the pessimistic outlook materializing are not small. As the unemployment rate rises and investors rush to safe haven assets, the financial turmoil may intensify creating the perfect conditions for a deep recession, which would spill over into crypto.

Nevertheless, Tone Vays, a former Wall Street trader and VP at JP Morgan Chase, argues that an economic crisis would likely be beneficial for Bitcoin since it could thrive as a hedging asset. This type of environment is what makes the flagship cryptocurrency so resilient, according to the analyst.

While the Crypto Fear and Greed Index continues sensing “extreme fear” among market participants, Vays said to be more bullish than ever. Who is right?

Bitcoin’s Pivotal Point

Based on its 1-day chart, Bitcoin broke out of an ascending triangle that was developing since the Mar. 12 crash. This technical formation is considered to be a continuation pattern that forecasts a 32% target to the upside upon the breakout point.

After moving above the horizontal trendline of an ascending triangle, most assets tend to return to the breakout point before continuing to trend. Currently, the pioneer cryptocurrency appears to be behaving this way.

A further increase in demand for Bitcoin around the current price levels could push it up to $9,000 or higher. This target is determined by measuring the height of the triangle at its thickest point and adding that distance to the breakout point.

Nonetheless, if the current level of support provided by the 78.6% Fib fails to hold, the bellwether cryptocurrency could drop to the next demand barrier around $6,100. This price hurdle would then be key to BTC’s trend.

Breaking below it will add credence to Hayes’ outlook, while bouncing off from it will give hope to investors.

Only time will tell whether Bitcoin will be able to thrive as a safe haven asset during the ongoing financial meltdown or plummet with the rest of the markets.","In two recent studies, I investigated the technical trading rules in the cryptocurrency market and profitability of technical trading rules among cryptocurrencies with a privacy function.

In our first study, we collected daily price data on eleven cryptocurrencies for the period Jan. 1, 2016 to Dec. 31, 2018. Our sample consisted of cryptocurrencies exhibiting the highest market capitalization as at Jan. 3, 2016. Our main sample comprised Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Peercoin, BitShares, Stellar Lumen (XLM), Nxt, MaidSafeCoin and Namecoin.

Using a simple buy-and-hold strategy of an equally weighted portfolio, our sample of cryptocurrencies produced an average return of 36.87% per year over our sample period. It is important to note that technical trading in cryptocurrency markets is different from equity markets for many reasons, two being that cryptocurrencies are traded 24/7, and short positions cannot be taken on cryptocurrencies unless trading Bitcoin (BTC) only.

We implemented the simplest and most widely used technical trading rule referred to as Variable Moving Average oscillator, which generates trading signals employing a short period and a long period, both moving in accordance with the average level of a price index. We only focused on the payoffs from buy positions simply because it is not possible to take short positions on cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin.

In the study, running a (1, 20) strategy meant taking a long position on a cryptocurrency whenever its current price exceeds the 20-day moving average, and holding the position until a sell signal is generated. A sell signal, in turn, was generated when the current price of a cryptocurrency was below the 20-day moving average. In this case, we keep the money in cash. In a similar manner, we implemented (1, 20), (1, 50), (1, 100), (1, 150) and (1, 200) strategies.

When implementing the (1, 20) strategy, we found that five of the 10 cryptocurrencies generated payoffs that were statistically significant on at least a 5% level. On average, the (1, 20) VMA strategy produced a 45.63% average return per year for the 10 cryptocurrencies compared to their buy and hold average return of 36.87% per year. More precisely, this technical trading rule generated around 8.76% per year in excess return over the sample period. Our results also suggest that a longer time horizon used for implementing the VMA strategies results in less profitable technical trading.

In our second study, we followed the same research design of our earlier paper, but used data on the 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies that provide a so-called “privacy function.” The privacy function allows users to maintain some anonymity on either the user level, the transaction level, the account balance level, or having full privacy on all levels. As an example, Dash allows users to have the “anonymous send” option if they wish to anonymize their user level information.

Hence, our study employed the following cryptocurrencies: Dash (DASH), Bytecoin (BCN), DigitalNote (XDN), Monero (XMR), CloakCoin (CLOAK), AeonCoin (AEON), Stealth (XST), Prime-XI (PXI), NavCoin (NAV), Verge (XVG). The sample covers the same period as in our earlier study.

The results of this study shows that VMA strategies are successful only for Dash (on the single cryptocurrency level) and yielded returns of 14.6% to 18.25% per year in excess of the simple buy-and-hold trading strategy for this coin. Surprisingly, when we averaged the average returns across the entire set of 10 privacy coins, we did not find any positive average portfolio returns in excess of the equally-weighted buy-and-hold portfolio.

In summary, the results of our two studies provide mixed evidence. On the one hand, technical trading seems to generate profits when implementing strategies among non-privacy cryptocurrencies. The profitability is, however, limited as only shorter time horizons of the VMA’s long-period moving average appear to provide useful information. On the other hand, privacy cryptocurrencies seem to form a more efficient market, as technical trading does not appear to provide significant payoffs in excess of the simple buy-and-hold strategy from a market-wide perspective.

The mentioned studies were conducted together with my colleagues Shaker Ahmed and Niranjan Sapkota, who both work as doctoral students in finance at the University of Vaasa (Finland).","With Bitcoin’s halving arriving next month on May 11, 2020, the expectation across the world of crypto has long been that the valuation of the first-ever cryptocurrency would skyrocket, but last month’s catastrophic selloff has some questioning the theory.

However, according to historical data, Bitcoin price is currently on pace with where the crypto asset was before the previous halving, and before the hype bubble began to inflate.

Calculating the Crypto Cycle: Bitcoin on Pace With Previous Halving Price Action

The crypto asset class has suffered through over two full years of brutal downtrend and bear market, eliminating 90% or more from the value of most cryptocurrencies.

From peak to trough, Bitcoin price fell by 84% from its all-time high of $20,000 to the current bottom set at $3,200.

Related Reading | Bitcoin To Explode By 80% Before Halving According to Past Cycle Comparison

The catalyst for the massive bull run, when you look at Bitcoin price charts, appears to be the asset’s halving.

Each halving the block reward miners receive for validating the blockchain network is reduced by 50%. The theory is that the reduced supply entering the market eventually lessens selling pressure from miners, causing an imbalance of supply and demand that causes valuations to skyrocket.

Following the last two halvings, depicted in the above price chart as red dotted vertical lines, Bitcoin price absolutely exploded in value, not stopping until the next major peak is reached, and then cycle restarts anew.

But the latest selloff in the face of the coming recession and the dramatic impact the pandemic has had on the economy, all liquid assets tumbled, including Bitcoin, gold, the stock market, and more.

It caused even the strongest believers in the emerging tech and asset class to consider the possibility that the experiment is over, and fear that these assets could soon be priced at zero in the mad dash to cash out ahead of the coming storm.

However, the latest collapse has actually taken Bitcoin back down to more realistic valuations, putting it perfectly on pace with the previous halving, signaling that the fabled post-halving crypto bull run isn’t out of the realm of possibility.

When measuring the distance from the bottom of each cycle, to current levels comparatively with where Bitcoin price is now versus the last bear-transitioning-into-bull market cycle.

From bottom to where Bitcoin price is currently trading, represents a more than 120% gain from the bottom set at $3,200.

During the same timeframe in the last cycle – just one month away from the halving – Bitcoin price was also trading at 120% above where the bottom was set 18 months prior.

What happened after put Bitcoin and crypto on the map as a financial asset. Bitcoin price grew from under $500 to over $5,000 before the public caught on. Later FOMO brought the asset to $20,000.

Now, Bitcoin price is back at the peak point of financial opportunity. If it plays out exactly the same, Bitcoin price would momentarily trade above $300,000 at the next peak.

As exciting as that may sound, it would be unrealistic that Bitcoin price performs as well as it has in past cycles, as each new cycle has provided diminishing returns. Regardless, getting in now is still early enough to reap the benefits of the next crypto bubble, which has yet to even begin.

Photo by Hans Eiskonen on Unsplash","Bitcoin halving is due next month, however, there appears to have a whole lot of other factors which will equally affect the Bitcoin price in the longer-run.

Unlike what German bank BayernLB had earlier predicted that Bitcoin halving would drive the price to $90K, there are reasons to believe that the halving hype will be shortlived.

Meanwhile, on April 8, as another popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash went through the halving there was hardly any noticeable climb. Bitcoin Cash registered a meagre 5.9% climb on then halving day, which is not unusual given its volatility.

Italian Red Cross Receives Crypto In Donation

Since its launch on March 12, the Italian Red Cross’ Bitcoin fundraising campaign has so far received $32,000 as donation for Covid-19 assistance in Italy.

While the first target of €10,000 in Bitcoin was achieved in just three days, the campaign has hit the second target of raising €25,000 in Bitcoin within a month. The transactional charges are worth 0.55%.

Commenting on the campaign, Bruno Pietrosanti, president at Colli Albani Committee, said, “With great pleasure, we reached the first main milestone of our fundraising. We are happy to have turned the received donations into a tangible aid and we are excited to have received so much help from the Bitcoin community.”

Binance Shuts Down $1 Mn Theft Accusation Case

In a recent statement, Binance has disclosed that having complied to all necessary due diligence steps as required by Korean law enforcement agency in the B.K. case, the exchange has decided to shut down the theft case until a further query from the authorities is raised.

On November 8, 2019, a Binance user named B.K. had stolen 3,995 ETH in funds from a South Korean citizen by impersonating a Binance official. The Korean agency had later requested Binance to reverse the fund, which the exchange did.

According to Cointelegraph report, B.K. however claimed that only 2,844.88 ETH was related to the allegations and that Binance had misappropriated $251,194 not associated with the case. On the other hand, the exchange claimed that B.K. added his own account figures to other accounts involved in the case.

HTC Exodus 1S To Mine Monero Cryptocurrency

Taiwan-based smartphone maker HTC has announced plans to launch an app called DeMiner for HTC Exodus 1S which will allow its Exodus 1S owners to mine Monero using the phone’s power.

The app is being developed in partnership with Midas Labs and will be launched in the second quarter.

Commenting on the same, Phil Chen, the decentralized chief officer at HTC said, “The crypto world is under threat from the domination of the hash rate by giant mining pools. The most effective way to eliminate this problem is to make mining accessible for the masses, and that is through mobile. This app makes smartphone mining cost-efficient, which gives incentives to individual miners and helps to decentralise the network. This is the first step and being able to mine Monero, a privacy-centric token, which fits very well within the EXODUS vision.”","The week behind us had many news and quite a few firsts for us. ETH saw a wave of buying, leaving BTC in the dust, while BTC's mining difficulty was set to increase - which indeed it did, and BCH had its first halving, with miners seen changing camps ahead of it. Meanwhile, BSV rallied ahead of its own first halving, while opinions still remain largely divided on how BTC's halving will affect its price. Ray Dalio thrashed cash as store of value, but avoided Bitcoin questions, and cryptos are property and owned by account holders, said the judge in the Cryptopia case.

Let's continue into the regulation land, aka 'reguland'. FSB brought fourth an assessment report on cross-border payments, and BIS said that coronavirus transmission could hasten the push towards CBDCs, while the Bank of Korea is already “one step closer” to launching a pilot for a CBDC, but dismayed blockchain startups are excluded from the country's tax support plan. Japan green-lighted two new legal crypto exchange-specific amendments to existing financial acts, and a lawmaker challenged the government on its crypto tax rate policy. Some of the biggest names in the crypto industry were included in a series of lawsuits, while illegal ‘crypto exchange’ operator was arrested in the Nth Room investigation. And while Mexican fintech firms have to wait longer for licenses because of the coronavirus, good news came from Italy as the Bitcoin-funded coronavirus medical center became operational.

And with that, let's move on to the jokes. Enjoy!

And lastly, here's our weekend movie recommendation.","As the latest bitcoin halving approaches, miners are upgrading equipment, optimizing arrangements, conserving power and more in the race to dominate.

How are bitcoin (BTC) miners strategizing for the upcoming halving event, in which block reward subsidies will be cut by 50 percent?

On this week’s episode of “Bitcoin Halving 2020: Miner Perspectives,” Kristy-Leigh Minehan and Pavel Moravec give an in-depth explanation of what miners are doing to maximize profits and increase operational efficiency.

Since October, Minehan explains, bitcoin mining farms have been getting on “the upgrade train” and purchasing state-of-the-art ASIC machines such as the Antminer S17 and S19. Moravec says bitcoin miners have also been looking at creative ways to cut electricity costs by leveraging surplus energy from certain cities’ power grids.

What started primarily as a hobby in 2009 has flourished over the years, gained broader adoption and ultimately evolved into a new, professional industry.

“We’ve gotten to a point in bitcoin’s history where the government is paying attention and has started to realize bitcoin isn’t going away,” Minehan said. “Mining is not going away. And it’s in their best interest to start working with miners.”

Teaming up with local governments and utility providers is another miner strategy both Minehan and Moravec have seen on the increase in recent years. This is why Minehan believes even the geographic distribution of miners, which was discussed in depth in an earlier podcast episode, may further stretch the industry into North America and Europe. (China remains the dominant locale.)","A trust has sued businessman, Brock Flagstad, over allegedly misappropriating over $2 million in funds that were purportedly designated for cryptocurrency trading.

Despite Flagstad soliciting the funds for the purpose of digital asset trading, the James Streibich Revocable Trust accuses the businessman of siphoning money from the investment to fuel an exorbitant lifestyle involving private jets and luxury vehicles.

Businessman accused of misappropriating over $2M

The complaint has been brought against both Flagstad individually, and against seven companies operated by the businessman — levying allegations of fraud, theft, conspiracy, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty.

The trust asserts that Flagstad reached out to its trustee, James Streibich, in May 2018 to pitch an investment that would be used by his firm Folding Light’s “proprietary financial trading platform.”

In exchange for a $2 million investment, Streibich claims the trust was assured a preferred interest in Folding Light and informed by Flagstad’s attorney that the funds would exclusively be used for trading.

However, the trust claims that within just weeks of its investment, Flagstad began “siphoning trading capital the trust invested with Folding Light to outside banking accounts and his other ventures.”

Flagstad allegedly requested $200K loan and fled to Georgia

After Folding Light’s trading team left the firm in 2018 to start a new company, the trust states it accepted a request from Flagstad for a $200,000 line of credit.

In the Summer of 2019, the trust claims that Flagstad stopped making interest payments on the loan, moved to the state of Georgia, and became “increasingly unavailable.”

Flagstad allegedly operates 17 companies from the same address in Chicago, with the plaintiffs accusing him of perpetrating similar schemes targeting other Chicago-based investors.

“Flagstad has solicited millions of dollars in private equity funds for Flagstad companies from numerous prominent Chicago-area investors,” the complaint reads.

Investment capital possibly used to fund lavish lifestyle

Streibich claims to possess banking documents showing at least $849,000 that had been wired from Folding Light to his personal bank account.

The trust insinuates that some of the funds it invested may have been used to support exorbitant purchases, with the claim asserting that “Flagstad has a rapacious personal need for cash to support his lavish lifestyle of private jets and expensive cars.”

The trust is seeking injunctive relief and compensation for damages.

Flagstad denies allegations

The businessman’s attorney, Stan Sneeringer, told Law360 that the allegations against Flagstad are false and they intend to defend the case “vigorously.”

“Anyone can allege anything they want in a complaint, particularly where, as here, the allegations are made ‘on information and belief.’ It is another matter to prove those allegations in a court of law,” he added.",,
2020-04-12,"Bitcoin and the crypto universe are going through one of the toughest periods as the world battles the coronavirus pandemic. The central banks and governments are trying to support the economy by announcing several easing measures.

While this has improved sentiment in the short-term, it could reduce the value of fiat currencies in the long-term. In a recent interview, Bridgewater Associates co-chairman and co-CIO Ray Dalio said that he does “not think that cash is a safe investment.""

Barring the panic selling on March 12, Bitcoin has held up quite well in 2020. This shows that long-term investors are unruffled about the current crisis and are holding out as they expect the price to rise in the future. When a nascent asset class proves itself during a major crisis, it is likely to attract the attention of the institutional investors.

Bitcoin is a volatile asset, hence, analysts sometimes project targets that are either sky-high or highly depressed. BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes and a pseudonymous trader who’s known as “Crypto Capo” both expect Bitcoin to drop to $3,000 levels or lower. Hayes believes that the US equity markets will roll over and resume their downtrend, which could result in another round of panic selling in Bitcoin.

While anything is possible during times of panic, we believe that cryptocurrencies are unlikely to hit new yearly lows even if the US equity markets decline. Let’s look at the weekly charts of the top five cryptocurrencies to determine their long-term trend.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekly chart shows that the price has been trading inside a large symmetrical triangle. The breakout or breakdown of this triangle will start the next directional move, which is likely to last for a few months.

BTC-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

In mid-March of this year, the BTC/USD pair dropped below the support line of the symmetrical triangle. Though this breakdown was a negative sign, the bears could not capitalize on the move and drag prices lower. This suggests a lack of sellers at lower levels.

The bulls quickly pushed the price back into the triangle, which is likely to have trapped a few aggressive bears. This led to a quick recovery in the following weeks. However, the bulls are currently facing resistance at the 20-week exponential moving average ($7,724).

We also spot a bearish rising wedge, which will complete if the pair breaks below $6,400. Such a move could result in a retest of the support line of the symmetrical triangle.

The 20-week EMA has started to slope down marginally, which suggests that the bears might have a slight edge in the short-term. Since the pair topped out closer to $14,000 levels in June of last year, the Relative Strength Index has not been able to scale above the 60 level, which suggests weakness.

However, if the bulls can propel the price above the wedge at $7,700, a rally to the 50-week simple moving average ($8,676) is possible. A break above this level can push the price to the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle at $10,500.

A breakout of the triangle will start a new uptrend that is likely to rise to $14,000 and then retest the lifetime highs. Contrary to our assumption, if the bears sink the pair below the support line of the symmetrical triangle, it will be a huge negative. However, we give this a low probability of occurring.

ETH/USD

Ether (ETH) has largely been range-bound between $84.25 and $366 for about 18 months. Such a long consolidation, after a sharp decline, usually indicates a bottoming process. The best way to trade such a large range is to buy the dips to the support ($84.25) of the range and close the position near the resistance ($366).

ETH-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

Recently, the ETH/USD pair dropped close to the support of the range, which was bought by the bulls. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the key support levels. The relief rally from the lows is facing resistance at the 20-week EMA ($171), which is sloping down gradually.

Any dip from the current levels is likely to find support at $117.09 and below it at $84.25. We like that the RSI held the 40 levels during the recent decline. This has formed a bullish divergence, which is a positive sign.

If the bulls can drive the pair above the 20-week EMA and the 50-week SMA ($193.54), a rally to $288.599 and above it to $366 is possible. A breakout of the range will be a huge positive as it will start a new uptrend that is likely to reach $647.74 and above it $800.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the next dip slides and sustains below $84.25. Such a move will be a huge negative.

XRP/USD

XRP has been in a long-term downtrend. It has consistently been making lower highs and lower lows for more than two years. This shows that the investors use the rallies to lighten up their holdings, which is a bearish sign.

XRP-USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview

On the downside, the $0.22255 support had held until late last year. Though the bulls purchased the first dip below this level in Dec., they could not sustain the higher levels. As a result, the XRP/USD pair again plunged to new multi-year lows recently.

Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative territory, which suggests that the advantage is with the bears.

The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back above the overhead resistance of $0.22255. The 20-week EMA ($0.21752) is also close to this level, hence, we anticipate the bears to defend this level aggressively.

If the pair turns down from this overhead resistance, the bears will try to resume the downtrend by sinking the price below the recent low of $0.114. If successful, it will be a huge negative.

On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above $0.22255, a move to the 50-week SMA at $0.27730 is possible. The downtrend line is also close to this level, which is likely to act as a major hurdle for the bulls.

The traders can wait for a higher high and a higher low formation to complete before turning positive on the pair.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading inside a wide range of $166-$515.35 for about a year. During this period, the price has touched the resistance and the support of the range two times each. This shows that the range is well defined.

BCH-USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview

The bears had recently plunged the BCH/USD pair below the support at $166, however, they could not sustain the lower levels. This is a bullish sign as it would have trapped a few aggressive bears.

The price quickly re-entered the range but the relief rally is facing stiff resistance at the moving averages. Even between July and Dec. of last year, the moving averages had acted as a strong barrier.

Therefore, the bulls need to push the price above the 50-week SMA ($303.19) to increase the possibility of a rally to $515.35. A breakout of the range will be a huge positive as it has a target objective of $864.70.

However, if the price turns down from the current levels and plummets below $166, the bears will attempt to drag it below the recent low of $141.11. If successful, it will be a huge negative as it could start a new downtrend.

BSV/USD

Bitcoin SV (BSV) had been stuck in a range of $254.13 and $38.8528 for more than a year. In January of this year, the altcoin broke out of the range and surged to new highs. The target objective of a breakout of the range was $469.4072 and BSV reversed direction from $458.74.

BSV-USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

The bulls bought the dip to $254.13, which was now acting as a support. However, the failure to break out to new highs attracted another round of selling that dragged the BSV/USD pair to a low of $82.771.

The subsequent relief rally reached $227, which is just below the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the most recent decline. This shows that the pair might now remain stuck in a range between $254.13 on the upside and $77 on the downside.

Both the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is close to the midpoint, which suggests a balance between both buyers and sellers.

The balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can propel the price above $254.13. Above this level, a rally to $382.47 is possible. Though $268.842 and $319.424 might act as resistance, we expect these levels to be crossed.

Alternatively, a break below $77 will shift the advantage in favor of the bears. Below this level, a retest of the low at $38.8528 is likely. The best way to trade the range is to buy the bounce off the support or wait for the price to break out of it.

Key Takeaways Bakkt primarily serves as a Bitcoin futures trading platform.

Right now, it primarily serves financial institutions and institutional investors.

It also plans to expand its services with custody solutions and payment tools.

Share this article

Bakkt is a trading platform that primarily offers Bitcoin futures, a type of financial contract and derivative that allows investors to buy and sell BTC at a certain date and price.

Prior to its 2019 launch, Bakkt was seen as a highly promising and innovative platform. Though the hype has faded since then, it remains highly notable and it is still expanding its offerings.

History of Bakkt

Bakkt was first announced by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in August 2018. Though it has always intended to provide a full ecosystem of digital services, that announcement made it clear that Bitcoin futures trading would become its initial flagship service.

Much of the anticipation around the trading platform arose from the fact that its parent company, ICE, also operates the New York Stock Exchange and several other major exchanges. Bakkt also secured several high-profile partners and supporters, including Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Microsoft, and Starbucks.

Though ICE intended to launch Bakkt in December 2018, the platform’s launch date was delayed to January 2019, then postponed indefinitely. These delays were attributed to regulatory uncertainty specific to Bakkt and to the broader U.S. government shutdown that was then underway.

The project finally went live in September 2019 and has been in operation since then. Since then, it continues to attract industry support. During the market crash of March 2020, Bakkt competed a a $300 million funding round with contributions from Microsoft, Pantera, and several other high-profile investors.

Bitcoin Futures

Unlike retail exchanges, Bakkt does not allow users to buy Bitcoin and store it in a wallet address. Instead, it offers futures contracts that can be settled for Bitcoin or cash at a later time.

Futures contracts are appealing to institutional investors and traders because they allow hedging, risk management, and price discovery. It also offers full regulatory compliance and physically delivered settlement, two more features that are important to institutional investors. In addition to daily Bitcoin futures, the platform has also launched monthly options.

Because the company caters to institutional investors, its trading volumes are fairly low. As of March 2020, daily volume on the derivatives platform is just over $12 million, 200-times less than leading retail exchanges that offer futures contracts. BitMEX and OKEx, for example, handle $2.5 billion in derivatives per day.

Despite Bakkt’s niche appeal, retail users may be able to use Bakkt indirectly. Executives have suggested that the company plans to make futures contracts available through retail brokerages.

Physical Bitcoin Settlement

One of Bakkt’s key features is physical settlement and delivery of Bitcoin. In theory, this means that the firm has sufficient Bitcoin in reserve to pay investors. These coins are securely stored in “Bakkt Warehouse.” As the name “Bakkt” suggests, contracts are physically “backed” by Bitcoin.

However, the company has admitted that futures contracts are also backed by cash and Treasuries. Furthermore, there appears to be little demand for Bitcoin settlement. Most of Bakkt’s futures contracts are settled in cash, not in Bitcoin. Arcane Research observed in January 2020 that physically settled Bitcoin futures make up “a small amount to what the daily trading volumes are on Bakkt.”

This means that Bakkt’s derivatives offerings are similar to what’s available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange—cash settled Bitcoin options, which may also explain Bakkt’s low volumes.

As of March 2020, about 300 BTC, or $2 million, of Bakkt’s volume is physically delivered—significantly more than last year, but still a small amount overall. Demand for this feature may grow over time.

Custody Services

The Bakkt Warehouse was originally intended for use with Bitcoin futures settlement, but it has been extended to serve as a general custody service since November 2019.

Like most custody services, the Bakkt Warehouse stores assets in a way that is acceptable to institutional investors. It implements crypto security strategies such as cold (offline) storage, combined with standard financial security practices such as auditing and insurance policies.

The service has gained approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), allowing it to provide custody in a way that complies with major regulations.

Bakkt cites Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Tagomi as firms that are using the service. Its custody services may grow larger as well. In April 2019, Bakkt acquired the Digital Asset Custody Company, a custody provider that supports 13 blockchains and over 100 assets.

Payments and Rewards

The company’s latest effort is “Bakkt App,” a mobile application for spending and managing digital assets.

Though the app will support Bitcoin balances, it is not meant to handle cryptocurrency exclusively. It will also support loyalty points, game points, and cash balances.

Bakkt App is not available to general users as of April 2020. However, it is possible to sign up and gain early access, and Bakkt has suggested that the app will be available more widely in summer 2020.

Some developments related to the app are already underway. Bakkt’s partnership with Starbucks, one of its longest-running efforts, has come to fruition through the app. Starbucks has begun to support Bakkt Cash payments for some users as of March 2020.

The company also plans to acquire Bridge2 solutions, a loyalty and rewards company, which will allow it to give its users payment options for a wide variety of companies and retailers.

However, competition in the mobile payments and rewards space is fierce. Incumbents like CashApp and loyalty app Fivestars could make it difficult for the company to gain market share.

Summary

Though Bakkt’s initial launch was highly anticipated, it did not have as profound an impact on the cryptocurrency market as many commentators expected. Bakkt exists in a highly volatile crypto market, and the launch of the product did not seem to have a lasting impact on Bitcoin’s price.

However, Bakkt is successful in its own right. Even though its futures trading volumes are modest, the platform seems to fill a niche, and the company seems to be delivering on its promises.

It is possible that Bakkt’s payments and reward app will help it attract greater attention from general users, but since the app has not launched yet, its future is uncertain.","Venezuela-based exchange Criptolago is rolling out a new service that allows crypto users to send Bitcoin (BTC) without having to be connected to the internet.

The service, which supports crypto transactions via text message, was launched on April 6th in response to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s call to action. Strapped by US sanctions, hyperinflation, a spiraling economy and political pressure, Maduro is looking for offline payment systems that can work with the petro, the controversial government-issued digital currency that his administration launched in February of 2018.

According to Criptolago,

“Following our president’s guidelines Nicolas Maduro and for our crypto nation with the new payments by SMS, we have opened the possibility for all the Venezuelan people to carry out transactions in Petro in a very practical way.”

Criptolago’s new SMS-based payment system supports all cryptocurrencies on the platform including the petro, BTC, Litecoin (LTC), Dash, and the token of the Venezuelan crypto bank Glufco.

The service also enables the transfer of bolivar, the national fiat currency, without an internet connection.

The exchange hopes the new service will be a boon for the country, where about 30% of the population does not have access to the internet.

CEO of Morgan Creek Digital, Mark Yusko, was a recent guest on Thinking Crypto, a Youtube crypto news channel.

In the interview, Mr. Yusko discussed the current state of the stock market, COVID19, the genesis of Morgan Creek Capital, CBDCs and more.

He further explained that XRP and XLM were too closely held by Ripple and the Stellar foundation respectively.

In a recent interview on Thinking Crypto, the CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, Mark Yusko, talked about the current state of the stock markets, the global impact of COVID19, amongst other relevant topics in our current global economic environment.

Why Morgan Creek Won’t Hold XRP or XLM

One key takeaway from the interview was why the crypto fund did not have XRP and Stellar (XLM) on its Digital Asset Index Fund. He explained the reason for this was that both digital assets were too closely held by Ripple and the Stellar foundation respectively.

We exclude anything that is too closely held. So we don’t own Stellar, we don’t own XRP.

XRP & XLM, Just Like Tesla, are Too Closely Held

He also added that his vision for the firm’s Digital Asset Index Fund was to have it evolve into the S&P 500 of cryptocurrencies.

The reason we set up the digital asset index fund the way we did…we wanted it to be the S&P 500 of crypto. And what does the S&P 500 do? It has a committee that decides which 500 companies go in. And then they exclude anything that is closely held…that can be manipulated by price. And so Tesla for example, by size, would be on the S&P but it can’t be because it is too closely held. So the same thing is true in crypto. There were two that had too much densely held tokens and so we feel like those can be…they are not as freely tradeable as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash and Monero.

Conclusion

Morgan Creek’s decision to exclude XRP and Stellar (XLM) on its Digital Asset Index Fund has provided much-needed insight into how institutional investors view the two digital assets. Such investors will avoid both cryptos because Ripple and the Stellar Foundation own considerable amounts of XRP and XLM. Perhaps with the additional crypto market distribution of both XRP and XLM, shall such crypto funds consider them as part of their portfolios.

This Analyst Thinks Yes

More analysts than ever are encouraging young people to take advantage of the current market dip and begin investing in Bitcoin for retirement. Whereas this idea is nothing new, current forces in the legacy financial space are making it more appealing. At least one analyst asserts that a mere one Bitcoin will provide a vastly better long-term return than traditional savings.

Inflation Could Be A Game Changer

Over the course of the past forty years retirement plans in developed countries have gradually shifted from fixed benefit programs, such as standard pension plans, to defined contribution programs, such as 401ks. Whereas the wisdom of this transition is subject to debate, there is no question that millions now rely on some form of personal savings for most, if not all, of their retirement income.

For those with ample nest eggs, this arrangement has been fine. However, decades of low inflation and brief recessions have played a role in this success. Should the current global financial crisis result in a surge of inflation, retirees could find themselves in serious trouble.

For those still in the workforce, long term devaluation of fiats such as Dollars and Euros could be devastating. Years of prudent investment could disappear as the earning power of retirement savings evaporates. Analyst Davincij15 has pointed this out in a recent tweet:

Growing up I saw this and thought yeah but I don't know how much $150,000 will buy me at 65 so I don't know how much I will need. Save up to just 1 #Bitcoin at 65 and you will have more than you need. pic.twitter.com/tTXILSnRdF — Davincij15 (@Davincij15) April 11, 2020

Simply put, he acknowledges the wisdom of beginning to save while young, yet notes that all may be for naught if inflation becomes a problem. Not surprisingly, he advocates Bitcoin as a possible hedge.

Bitcoin Moving Into Retirement Portfolios

Much has been said of Bitcoin as a potential safe haven during the current economic meltdown. However, the long-term consideration of this idea is far more notable. The fact that crypto ownership skews toward the young is well-known, and more than ever workers under 35 are choosing to add blockchain assets to their retirement portfolios.

Part of this trend is, of course, related to the belief that crypto will continue to vastly outperform traditional investments. However, these young investors may now be making this choice to protect their retirement from inflation or other economic downturns. In other words, crypto is likely to be added to hard assets like gold and treasury bonds as a component of a properly managed portfolio.

There is little doubt that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a permanent element of the global financial landscape. Now, more than ever, current events are giving legitimacy to this new asset class.

Bitcoin's (BTC) short-term trend has turned bearish following a drop to $6,600. Further losses could be in the offing, say chart analysts.

The recent liquidity-driven bounce in equities could falter, too, adding to the bearish pressures for bitcoin.

A UTC close above the 50-day average is needed to neutralize the bearish case.

Bitcoin is reporting losses on Monday, having ended last week with its longest weekly winning streak in nearly a year.

The top cryptocurrency by market value fell by $300 soon after midnight to hit a 12-day low of $6,600. Bitcoin was last seen trading near $6,693, representing a 2.5 percent decline over 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price index (BPI).

A near 2 percent price rally seen in the seven days to April 12 had marked bitcoin’s fourth straight weekly gain. Prices rose 15.4, 1.0, and 8.8 percent in the previous three weeks, respectively. A four-week winning trend was last seen in May 2019, as seen below.

Market woes to return?

The latest four-week price rise from $5,300 to $6,900 pales in comparison to the uptick seen 11 months ago. Back then, bitcoin jumped from $5,150 to $8,730 in the four weeks to May 26, 2019.

Further, the follow-up to the latest four weeks of gains has been negative so far. The cryptocurrency is flashing red, as noted above, and may continue to lose altitude in the near term, with some observers suggesting the recent equity market rally is liquidity-driven and has potential to unravel.

As of Thursday, the S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark index, was up 27 percent from multi-year lows near 2,200 observed on March 23. The Federal Reserve has announced multiple easing programs worth trillions of dollars over the past few weeks to help contain the impact of the coronavirus and cushion the markets.

However, the rally could soon begin to unwind, pushing bitcoin lower. That’s because the first-quarter corporate earnings season is set to begin this week and looks likely to bring a reality check to investors with disclosures over the extent of the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus restrictions.

“It would be unprecedented” if the S&P 500 failed to re-test or even fall below its low on March 23,” analysts at Bank of America Global Research said last week, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, Nomura’s analysts called the recent equity market bounce as “an unenthusiastic, inorganic bear market rally” in the same report.

Bitcoin has largely moved in tandem with the S&P 500 over the last six weeks or so. The cryptocurrency fell by 24 percent in March, as the S&P 500 declined by over 12 percent. Bitcoin is now reporting a month-to-date gain of 4 percent, while Wall Street’s benchmark index has added nearly 8 percent to its value so far this month.

The trend looks to be continuing, as bitcoin’s $300 slide seen during the Asian trading hours on Monday was accompanied by a 2 percent slide in futures tied to the S&P 500.

Bearish signals

Bitcoin fell by over 5 percent on Friday, confirming a rising wedge breakdown on the daily chart. The bearish reversal pattern often ends up reversing the previous move, meaning the doors have been opened for a re-test of the March low of $3,867.

Macro trader Henrik Zeberg is calling a move as low as $1,000. While that target looks far-fetched, a move to levels below $6,000 due to the wedge breakdown could be seen.

Another analyst, Josh Rager, suggests the pullback from last week’s high above $7,300 to $6,600 could be the start of a bearish lower-highs and lower-lows set up.

The four-hour chart shows that bitcoin has already established a lower high at $7,200. It’s also confirmed a head-and-shoulders breakdown with a drop below the neckline support of $6,790. That’s created room for a slide to $6,100 (target as per the measured move method).

The bearish case would weaken if prices print a UTC close above the 50-day average at $7,145. That hurdle proved a tough nut to crack last week.

A bullish close above the 50-hour average, if confirmed, would likely pave the way for a test of the psychological resistance of $8,000. Some analysts expect the upcoming mining reward halving to keep the cryptocurrency better bid in the short term.

“For the short term, we expect to see bitcoin retest the US$8,000 price level in the coming weeks, with the upcoming halving event in May serving as a catalyst for the digital asset’s continued appreciation,” Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack told CoinDesk.","A subsidiary of Japanese financial services giant SBI Holdings has seen its share of Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV) mining pool share rise since the first halving on April 10.

According to cryptocurrency information site CoinDance, cryptocurrency mining company SBI Crypto held about 4.4% of the total shares of BSV last week, but those numbers jumped to 15.28% on April 13.

Source: Coindance

The halving of BSV comes just a short time after BCH's halving event on April 8, and approximately one month prior to Bitcoin's halving, expected between May 11-13.

SBI Holdings’ ties to Craig Wright

Yoshitaka Kitao, Chief Executive Office (CEO) of SBI Holdings, is known for his friendship with Satoshi claimant Craig Wright, who backs BSV. However, when BSV hard-forked from Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in 2018, Kitao criticized the move, calling it a ""meaningless split"" that would lead to investors leaving.

Crypto laws to be enforced in Japan next month

Though SBI Holdings has demonstrated a heightened interest in digital currencies over the past months, the company’s registered crypto exchange in Japan will soon face regulatory challenges.

New laws for regulating cryptocurrencies in Japan are beginning to be enforced. The Payment Services Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, two of the pieces of legislation passed by the Japanese House of Representatives last year to regulate crypto, will come into effect on May 1.

Hisashi Oki of Cointelegraph Japan contributed to this article","The impact of COVID-19 across economies, industries and communities has largely been negative, with the hardest hit being travel, hospitality and aviation.

George Colony, chief executive officer of Forrester, mapped out four phases to the pandemic for the U.S. that apply to most countries. Phase one (infection) runs from Jan. to mid-March; phase two (social distancing) March to mid-May; phase three (management) — the most challenging phase — runs from mid-May into 2021; phase four (eradication) occurs sometime between April and June 2021.

Colony warns that should Phase Three be “mismanaged by companies, states, and the federal government, we will not drop back to Phase Two — we will loop back to Phase One and start the process from the beginning. This will risk a year-long disruption of the economy rather than the three-month disruption caused by Phase Two.”

An alarming admonition, to be sure. Yet, amidst the general doom and gloom, some other industries are opening up new areas of growth. Food delivery services, tele-conferencing apps, movie-streaming services, medical supplies and equipment have experienced such massive surges in demand that keeping up is causing its own set of problems.

All-time high in crypto trading volumes

Another industry that has experienced unexpected growth and interest is the crypto industry. While COVID-19 exposed an initial short-term correlation of Bitcoin (BTC) with traditional assets, the market volatility in cryptocurrency prices has led to a spike in trading volumes.

Amid a reversal of the three-year market gains under Trump and stocks in Europe falling to their lowest levels since 2012, the start of the pandemic saw unprecedented fluctuations and price swings in the crypto markets. On March 12th, BTC fell under USD 4,000 while popular tokens such as ETH, XRP and LTC experienced double-digit falls.

Major exchanges such as Binance, Huobi and OKEx recorded a significant rise in volumes as traders rushed to capitalize on these fresh opportunities. Aggregated daily and weekly volumes began reaching all-time highs, showing substantial pick up in investor interest.

According to Binance, “derivatives trading activity increased as traders and investors rushed to capitalize on opportunities to hedge and participate in the selling momentum. Unsurprisingly, the derivatives markets became the go-to venue for them to take advantage of these opportunities.”

India’s largest trading platform, WazirX, saw its daily volume grow over 470% in the last month. Besides the sharp price movements, caused by COVID-19 uncertainty, which triggered more trades, the other contributing factor was the Supreme Court’s lift of the Reserve Bank of India’s controversial ban on crypto trading in India.

According to Ashish Singhal, chief executive officer of Sequoia Capital-backed CoinSwitch, the lifting of the ban “has fueled new energy in the market. The volatility in the market because of COVID-19 is also encouraging more people to trade in the exchanges.”

Evolving niche

One important point to note is that even before COVID-19 came on the scene, the digital assets economy was evolving and maturing.

There were no other alternatives to the mainstream markets before Bitcoin. Built on a decentralized network protocol — a public blockchain — Bitcoin offered a store and transfer of value in a digital currency that was theoretically impervious to manipulation by central banks and global financial institutions.

COVID-19 has proven to be a litmus test of sorts for that theory.

We can attribute the initial correlation between traditional and crypto market asset prices to the general FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) experienced globally.

However, since then, the crypto markets have bounced back with a measure of resilience. BTC traded for as high as USD 7,300 on April 9th, and at the time of writing is at USD 6,700 with many cryptocurrencies also regaining prices pre-March 12. This is because BTC has long been the barometer for all other cryptocurrencies. Analyses over wide ranges of time consistently show that the prices of most cryptos — especially of Ether (ETH) — depend on the BTC value.

Another encouraging sign for the crypto market is that network fundamentals are also showing recovery signs with the BTC mining hash rate reportedly having regained 34% since the carnage of March 12.

Decentralized, P2P and Borderless

In fact, one can say that situations like the ongoing pandemic are the perfect backdrop against which mass adoption of decentralized, peer-to-peer and borderless payment mechanisms can happen.

Working remotely, stay-at-home orders, travel bans and restrictions have no impact on crypto transactions as they can be sent and received in the safety of people’s homes. Stablecoins are looking like safe havens for those who want to remain in the markets without too much risk exposure and have experienced an influx of funds from traders and investors.

In times like these, even precious metals like gold and silver face challenges from supply disruptions and logistics. Meanwhile cryptocurrencies, lines of code in essence, exist in cyberspace, neither restricted by state borders nor transportation challenges.

Especially in this current worrisome economic landscape of government bailouts and helicopter money, investors and traders will need better investment instruments over the long term.

As American venture capital investor and billionaire, Tim Draper of Draper Associates, recently declared, “when the world comes back, it will be Bitcoin, not banks and governments that save the day.”","Fraudsters are leveraging increased fear and uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic to steal your money and launder it through the complex cryptocurrency ecosystem.

People of all ages, including the elderly, are being victimized by criminals through cryptocurrency-related fraud schemes. Developments in cryptocurrency technology and an increasing number of businesses accepting it as payment have driven the growing popularity and accessibility of cryptocurrency. There are not only numerous virtual asset service providers online but also thousands of cryptocurrency kiosks located throughout the world which are exploited by criminals to facilitate their schemes. Many traditional financial crimes and money laundering schemes are now orchestrated via cryptocurrencies.

The FBI advises you to be on the lookout for an increase in the following cryptocurrency fraud schemes related to COVID-19:

Blackmail Attempts. Threatening emails or letters in which scammers claim to have access to your personal information or knowledge of your “dirty secrets” and demand payment in Bitcoin to prevent release of this information have been circulating for years. With the advent of COVID-19, there is a new twist on this scam. The correspondence claims that the writer will both release your information and infect you and/or your family with coronavirus unless payment is sent to a Bitcoin wallet.

Work from Home Scams. Scammers, posing as employers, may ask you to accept a “donation” of funds into your own bank account and to deposit them into a crypto kiosk. The so-called “donation” is likely money stolen from others. Your acceptance and transfer of the stolen money is considered illegal money mule activity and potentially unlicensed money transmission.

Paying for Non-Existent Treatments or Equipment. Scammers have been known to lure customers from trusted e-commerce sites offering products that claim to prevent COVID-19 onto unrelated and unregulated messaging sites to accept payment in cryptocurrencies for products that do not actually exist.

Investment Scams. Criminals often pitch fraudulent investments in a “new” and developing cryptocurrency, such as an initial coin offering (ICO) or other investment vehicle to take a victim’s money. These scams typically involve scenarios that seem “too good to be true”—offering large monetary returns for a short-term, small investment. The reality is that scammers steal the investment money for personal use and utilize the complexities of cryptocurrency to hide the true destination of the stolen funds.

Although there are legitimate charities, investment platforms, and e-commerce sites that accept payment in cryptocurrency, pressure to use a virtual currency should be considered a significant red flag.

By remembering the following tips regarding finances and cryptocurrency, you can better protect yourself from fraud:

Verify that a vendor/charity is legitimate and accepts cryptocurrency before sending payments/donations.

Conduct extensive research on potential investment opportunities.

Do not use your personal bank accounts for work-from-home business-related activity or provide your bank account information to someone who is not named on the account.

Contact law enforcement before paying out blackmail and/or extortion attempts and before converting your money into cryptocurrency to pay them.

The FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division has an entire team dedicated to preventing and combating cryptocurrency money laundering and frauds. If you believe you are the victim of a fraud, or if you want to report suspicious activity, please contact your local field office or visit the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov.

According to a company press release, the new on-chain analytics tool, dubbed “Star Atlas”, flags abnormal transactions in real time, suspends accounts and then conducts a follow-up investigation.

The company says it wants to fight bad actors on a global scale. One of its key objectives is to shake a long-held stigma about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general – that they are easily manipulated by criminals.

Says Ciara Sun, Huobi’s vice president of global business,

“It’s estimated that only a small percentage of cryptocurrency transactions are illicit, but any incident—regardless of size – is a stain on the entire industry,”

Star Atlas has been in development for over a year, spearheaded by leading crypto security experts. It takes a deep dive into the dark web and other networks potentially masking illegal transactions. The tracking system deploys a visual user interface so that Huobi administrators can trace transaction paths of illicit activities.

“Additionally, Star Atlas maintains a large address library with tens of millions of tags and tens of thousands of blacklisted addresses, which is updated and expanded automatically to allow Huobi to more efficiently detect malicious accounts and even dark web transactions among numerous complex transactions. The system also automatically monitors every on-chain transaction for markers of high-risk activity.”

The Singapore-based exchange has several offices across the world, including Hong Kong, Korea and Japan, enabling traders and investors in over 170 countries to buy, sell and exchange leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Litecoin. Huobi reportedly plans to reenter the US market where it will be subject to strict regulations.

There are few topics as controversial in the crypto sector as decentralized finance. Many believe it is the future of finance – removing middlemen will lower costs, unleash efficiencies and create a more transparent, resilient and better-distributed framework. Others (myself included) find the idea terrifying – a financial system without oversight or an off switch is even more vulnerable to manipulation and error than one that is legally accountable to the user and can be fixed when things go wrong. If a DeFi platform can be “fixed” when things go wrong, just how decentralized is it?

An example of this happened this week: decentralized exchange Bisq, which allows users to trade crypto assets anonymously, suffered a hack involving the theft of $250,000. To prevent a greater loss, the platform developers switched it off.

Obviously, from the users’ point of view it is a good thing Bisq did so. But Bisq also showed the world that it can, which calls into question the concept’s resilience – this time it was for the users’ benefit, but who’s to say that will always be the case? (No aspersions cast on the Bisq team, it’s the concept I’m talking about here.)

While I am personally skeptical of the concept, I am very intrigued by the potential impact DeFi could have on traditional finance. The two are not oil and water, and the automation and transparency of some innovative market functions emerging from the sector could broaden the scope and reach of the fintech applications of tomorrow.

So I perked up when I read about a group of Chicago-based institutional-grade crypto market participants banding together to form the Chicago DeFi Alliance, which aims to support crypto startups during the current coronavirus crisis. TD Ameritrade, Cumberland, CMT Digital, DV Trading and Jump Capital – many of them blue-chip names from traditional markets – have joined with venture capital firm Volt Capital and DeFi startup Compound, to provide advisory services to selected projects. This group of organizations has plenty of experience in traditional business and finance. Its participants also understand the potential appeal of an alternative system of value based on a decentralized network.

By focusing their energies on enabling institutions to invest in and trade crypto assets, they have already started to build up the intersection between the centralized and decentralized worlds. This new alliance, if successful, can move that relationship beyond the purely transactional – rather than just investing in and (hopefully) profiting from decentralized assets, its participants will be able to start to sketch out what a deeper interaction could look like, with the experience and sector-wide view necessary to keep it practical.

Getting better

You may be wondering why I’m featuring a technical upgrade in a newsletter that focuses on investment principles. It’s because bitcoin (BTC) is not just an investment asset – it’s a new technology whose use case is still evolving, and changes to that technology could be material in determining the eventual outcome.

Many investors see bitcoin as an asset without tangible fundamentals, whose price will go up or down according to market sentiment. While this is true, those who insist bitcoin has no intrinsic value overlook that it is more than just consensus around a price.

The intrinsic value of technologies depends on their use case. The narrative around bitcoin’s use case is still evolving – so far, it has not fulfilled its initial promise as a payments mechanism, but that doesn’t mean it never will. Some dispute its role as digital gold given its high volatility. Adoption as an alternative financial rail in areas with rickety and/or intrusive legacy systems is so far muted, given barriers to access and exit.

One bitcoin improvement proposal seriously being considered by the community is known as Schnorr/Taproot. If approved, this could enhance bitcoin’s privacy and scalability features, and support better payments functionality and improved smart contracts. If you’re interested in the details, my colleague Alyssa Hertig explains the proposed changes and their potential ramifications in depth.

But whether tech upgrades are your thing or not, even just talking about it highlights an often overlooked feature of crypto asset investing – it’s not just buying into a technology, it’s buying into an evolving technology. It’s like venture investing, getting in at the ground floor of a potentially important innovation – but in the form of a liquid asset. You enter without extensive contracts and exit whenever you want.

Even beyond the potential of the technology itself, whatever your views on that may be, that ease of access to the possible upside in itself is powerful. (In our just-released CoinDesk Quarterly Review Q4 2020, we summarize the most significant technical upgrades expected in the crypto asset market over the next few months.)

Deeper relationship?

In a confused market peppered with dividend cuts and the unwelcome realization that we are already in a recession, we can expect renewed interest in bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P500.

While last month saw a strong spike in correlations as everything crashed and then rebounded and crashed and rebounded again, it’s likely that we are starting to see an uncoupling. Bitcoin has so far performed better in April than any of the other major indices, in spite of the much-celebrated S&P 500 rally. It has even handily outperformed gold, although the shiny metal is still one of the top-performing assets for the year to date.

Going forward, times of heightened volatility in traditional markets are likely to aggravate bitcoin’s volatility even further; but as things settle into a “new normal,” bitcoin’s resilience and monetary policy, especially as the halving narrative gains in volume, are likely to support further outperformance.

Watch out also for fractures in the physical gold market, which could further destabilize markets overall, while highlighting bitcoin’s relative advantages.

Chain links

Digital assets are not a claim on assets or income streams, as are bonds and equities – they’re a claim on future services, and as such, don’t lose value in a recession. TAKEAWAY: This draws on something that we touched on in THE BRIEFING above: the “intrinsic value” of crypto assets. In the case of bitcoin, for example, the future services are the eventual use case of this new technology; in ERC-20 tokens, on the other hand, the future service is more clearly defined, but requires some platform building and/or user growth first. Either way, this highlights the unusual investment characteristics of crypto assets, and hints that just because they don’t have tangible assets or flows doesn’t mean that due diligence can be overlooked. Will this future service generate enough interest for the token in question to at least maintain its value?

The Bitcoin Fund, managed by Canadian investment firm 3iQ, has started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchanges under the symbol QBTC.U. TAKEAWAY: The market now has another way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without worrying about onramps and custody. So far, it’s still small – the market cap for the listed shares is approximately $14 million – but it’s the first such fund listed on a major stock exchange. It also highlights how hard it is to be a first mover in this space – the firm spent almost three years negotiating with the Ontario Securities Commission before approval was granted.

China-based bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer Canaan Creative, which listed on Nasdaq (CAN) in November, disclosed a net loss of $148.6 million for 2019 on revenue of $204.3 million. Although computing power sold (measured in Thash/s) was up almost 50 percent, net revenues for the year were down almost 50 percent, according to the company largely as a result of the lower price of bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: Since the figures were released, the share price fell by over 10 percent (to $3.20 at time of writing); it is now down almost 50 percent year to date, and over 60 percent below its listing price. What’s more, the company has downgraded its expectations for 2020 as a result of the crisis, which is likely to hit the Q1 figures. In an earnings call , the CEO and founder acknowledged a significant drop in December’s revenue. It’s also worth remembering the company is being sued in a class-action lawsuit amid allegations it released false and misleading statements to make its financial health appear better than it was prior to its initial public offering.

Those of you who have been watching this sector for a while will remember the heady days of 2017, when bitcoin’s price climbed ludicrously fast, starting the year at under $1,000 and reaching an all-time high of just under $20,000. Then came 2018, when the price fell by 60 percent over the course of a month. Well, bitcoin is even more volatile now, if you look at the standard deviation of the natural log of daily returns over the past 30 days. TAKEAWAY: Unprecedented times bring the greatest risk and the greatest opportunity (profound, I know).

Bitcoin’s hashrate is on the rise again. TAKEAWAY: You may remember that after the price crash of mid-March, Bitcoin’s hashrate (which represents the resources invested by miners in maintaining the network) also fell. Then bitcoin’s self-correcting mechanism known as the difficulty adjustment kicked in a couple of weeks ago, with the second sharpest drop in the network’s history. That, plus the recovery in the bitcoin price, seems to have done the trick: the hashrate is picking up again.

(See our recently released Halving Report for more detail on hashrates and the upcoming halving.)

Related to THE BRIEFING above, DappReview has published its Q1 report on decentralized application (dapp) activity, which shows solid growth, unevenly distributed. The number of dapp transactions grew over 80% year-on-year, fueled by ethereum-based financial applications. TAKEAWAY: The growth may be strong, but the financial figures are still low at under $8 billion (not inconsiderable, but not yet a threat to traditional finance). However, they do hint at a strong coalescence around the ethereum network, in spite of the efforts of competing blockchains. And the focus on financial applications underlines users’ interest in an alternative market system, which traditional providers should take note of.

I don’t have nearly as much time to listen to podcasts as I would like, especially during lockdown. (I miss going for walks!) But the CoinDesk podcast stable under Adam Levine is putting out some powerful stuff I have to flag.","A kind of ransomware — a malware that encrypts user data and asks for a ransom to restore access to it — switched from Bitcoin (BTC) to Monero (XMR) to better protect the hackers’ identities.

According to an April 11 report by cybersecurity news outlet BleepingComputer, using Monero will make it harder for law enforcement to track ransom payments to the hackers behind Sodinokibi. As the article mentions, Europol strategy analyst Jerek Jakubcek explained during a February webinar how anoncoins influence legal investigations:

“Since the suspect used a combination of TOR and privacy coins, we could not trace the funds. We could not trace the IP addresses. Which means, we hit the end of the road. Whatever happened on the Bitcoin blockchain was visible and that’s why we were able to get reasonably far. But with Monero blockchain, that was the point where the investigation has ended. So this is a classical example of one of several cases we had where the suspect decided to move funds from Bitcoin or Ethereum to Monero.”

“BTC will be removed”

Per the report, the hackers behind the Sodinokibi ransomware posted on a hacker and malware forum a post announcing their switch to Monero. In the post, the cybercriminals explicitly stated that the switch was meant to make it harder for law enforcement to track the money. The announcement reads:

“In this regard, we inform you that after a while the BTC will be removed as a payment method. Victims need to begin to understand the new cryptocurrency, as well as other interested parties who work with us.”

In fact, the Sodinokibi payment website already pushes people away from paying with Bitcoin by increasing the price in the currency by 10% compared to the Monero price. Interestingly, the group also looks for partners who can get the data access back for the users at a discount so they can add a surcharge to it while.

Threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Emsisoft Brett Callow told Cointelegraph that anoncoin use for the payment of ransomware ransom payment is less common than many would expect. He also noted that he would not be surprised if other ransomware groups followed suit:

“While there are some instances of demands being made in alternative currencies, this will be the first time that a major ransomware group has settled on a currency other than Bitcoin. Like other businesses, criminal enterprises adopt strategies that have been proven to work and, accordingly, if this switch proves successful for REvil, we’d expect to see other groups begin to experiment with demands in currencies other than bitcoin.”

Ransomware attacks are a growing threat

Many consider ransomware developed and distributed by well-organized cybercrime groups the biggest current cybersecurity threat. As Cointelegraph recently reported, a U.K.-based firm recently paid hackers almost $2.3 million in Bitcoin after being infected by the Sodinokibi ransomware.

Many are afraid that the current coronavirus pandemic will exacerbate the consequences of successful attacks on healthcare providers. In an attempt to alleviate the danger, Microsoft recently notified hospitals that are vulnerable to ransomware attacks.","You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant.

The company isn’t going into receivership, however, as its investor, FastForward Innovations, claimed last week, said Factom COO Jay Smith.

Bearish case

Bitcoin is reporting losses on Monday, having ended last week with its longest weekly winning streak in nearly a year. The short-term trend has turned bearish following a drop to $6,600, with a close above the 50-day average at $7,145 needed to neutralize the bearish case.

2020-04-14,"After weeks of elevated activity, trading volumes on spot bitcoin exchanges have subsided, boding well for some traders if not the venues themselves.

Prices for bitcoin (BTC) climbed less than a percent Tuesday, retracing gains lost the day before when it hit a one-week low, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The price of the bellwether cryptocurrency is above the 10-day moving average on hourly charts, a bullish signal as bitcoin tries to climb back to $7,000 levels.

Bitcoin has been gaining price momentum since 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. EDT), jumping from the $6,800 area, closely touching the $7,000 level, but currently changing hands around $6,900.

“Yesterday’s drop seemed pretty manipulated but, as we’ve said before, these moves are more likely now as the liquidity has dried up significantly,” said Jack Tan, founding partner at Taiwan crypto trading firm Kronos Research.

Indeed, bitcoin volumes on USD/BTC exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitstamp have subsided to February levels after enjoying elevated volume in March when a massive sell-off occurred because of coronavirus-related fears. At one point, the price for 1 BTC dipped below $4,000 briefly during heavy trading action on March 12.

Depending on trading strategies, this lower-volume environment can prove beneficial for some market participants. Lower volume means thinner liquidity and can cause prices to swing more often.

“Our options strategies have been outperforming significantly given the crazy vol[atility] environment,” said Darius Sit, managing partner at QCP Capital. The options market is sending bearish signals ahead of bitcoin’s upcoming halving, giving traders like QCP clear indication how to trade in a lower volume spot market.

Despite exchanges reporting interest in bitcoin is increasing, volumes certainly are not, said Vishal Shah, an options trader building a new crypto derivatives exchange called Alpha5.

“Outside anecdotal claims by certain on-ramps that they’re seeing great inbound interest, the trade volume isn’t indicating it, and I don’t necessarily expect this to change on the other side of the halving, without any additional catalysts,” said Shah.

Of course, it’s possible new users are holding their bitcoin rather than actively trading it, or they are buying from exchanges and then trading on a peer-to-peer basis. And to the degree these converts are individuals rather than hedge funds or the like, their trades are less likely to move the needle on exchange volumes.

Other markets

Major digital assets are mixed on CoinDesk’s board for the day. Ether (ETH) jumped 2 percent.

Other big gainers include lisk (LSK) flashing green at 4 percent, monero (XMR), up 2 percent and ethereum classic (ETC) up 1 percent. Losers include dogecoin (DOGE) in the red 1 percent and XRP (XRP) down a percent. All price changes are from 20:45 UTC (4:45 PM EDT in New York) Tuesday.

Elsewhere, gold, the precious metal crypto traders follow closely, maintained its classic haven asset status through tumultuous times, currently trading up less than 1 percent. It’s been trading above its 10-day moving average since April 9, a long bullish trend for the yellow metal.

“Gold finally broke the $1,700 resistance point. We’re seeing sustained demand due to the continued rise of the number of COVID-19 cases globally,” said Nemo Qin, analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro. “Consumer spending and gold production begins to resume in China, which will support gold prices in the short term.”

Gold’s consistent price gain is how cryptocurrency enthusiasts were expecting bitcoin to behave but that’s not happening, and pessimistic views abound on bitcoin’s halving in May.

“Most people want to believe the halving will create a big upward move, but still feels like bears or a few big whales are going to squeeze us lower first,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.

In traditional markets, the Nikkei 225 climbed by 3 percent as analysts said a massive short squeeze pushed the Tokyo-based markets higher. The FTSE 100 European index ended the day up less than 1 percent, coming on the heels of Britain’s Office for Budget Responsibility indicating the U.K. economy could contract by 35 percent.

The S&P 500 index of large U.S. stocks gained 3 percent after both President Trump and several state governors said at separate briefings the coronavirus mitigation efforts appear to be working to flatten the rate people are hospitalized.

“Super surprised that the U.S market is so strong just now. I’ve been buying Dow puts as I think we’ll be a lot lower again soon,” Thomas said.","'Governments Will be Unable to Shut It Down' - John McAfee to Launch Privacy Centric Crypto

The U.S. Presidential candidate who remains on the run from the IRS, John McAfee, announced he’s launching a new privacy coin called Ghost. McAfee says the Ghost cryptocurrency will be a proof-of-stake (PoS) coin and it will be available on his decentralized exchange (dex). The former anti-virus software tycoon also stressed to the public on Twitter that by combining Ghost with his dex, governments won’t be able to shut the project down.

McAfee Is Launching a New Privacy Coin Called ‘Ghost’

John McAfee recently announced that he is launching a PoS-based cryptocurrency called Ghost. The move follows McAfee’s recent ERC20 token called “Epstein Did Not Kill Himself,” a coin that made fun of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. McAfee explained on April 11, that his new coin will have a white paper that will be published on May 15.

“My latest: Ghost – It’s a proof of stake privacy coin to make you a “ghost” when transacting online. Atomic swaps on McAfeeDex will let you trade against BTC/BCH/ETH and more,” McAfee tweeted. With a dex/privacy coin combo we now have full control of our finances,” he added. The project also has a website with a cartoon ghost and a few small descriptions about the new coin.

“Ghost transactions use a state of the art escrow pool to shield and erase the history of transactions,” the website explains. “Ghost transactions are verified using zero-knowledge proofs. Ghost is a proof-of-stake network controlled by token holders and users and Ghost has no central company or owner, and is ran and maintained by the community,” the site further adds. The website also notes that the Ghost project will have a Masternode system similar to the Dash protocol. Additionally, Ghost transactions are allegedly processed onchain in less than 60 seconds and for a “fraction of a penny paid in transaction fees.” McAfee’s Ghost website also details that people can obtain Ghost tokens for free by holding a token called ESH. The Ghost website states:

To claim your Ghost at launch (for free) you must be holding an ESH token on May 25th. 25% of the Ghost supply will be allocated to ESH token holders. The remaining supply of Ghost is allocated towards proof of stake rewards.

McAfee’s 2020 Presidential Candidacy and a Myriad of Crypto Projects

McAfee has been awfully busy even though he’s been on the run from U.S. tax authorities. Back in October, the 2020 Presidential candidate launched his dex with no restrictions. He spoke with our newsdesk in December 2019 and discussed topics like maximalism, Epstein’s death, and “the greatest gift since fire.” During the first week of January, McAfee said he was going to tokenize all 535 members of Congress. Moreover, that same week, the crypto community gave McAfee flak for backing out of his infamous price prediction bet.

Lately, McAfee has been speaking out against the propaganda and hype associated with covid-19. “Covid-19 will be virtually gone from infected countries by mid-May, because it is seasonal, like the flu,” McAfee tweeted. “But, it will be back in October, and we will have to lock ourselves in from October till next May. If we unlock in mid-season it will start over again — Bummer.” Further, McAfee recently told the public he has joined forces with Adam Kokesh, another liberty-leaning candidate who is also running for U.S. president. McAfee said that both candidates have mutually endorsed each other.

With the Bitcoin worth presented at slightly under $5,200, the world’s favourite cryptocurrency is depicted in the image above to have fallen by 27% in the space of 24 hours.

The panic caused by Coronavirus and its implications has caused Bitcoin to fall almost 45% within a week, with other altcoins following suit. Bitcoin’s dominance remains at around 66%, with the cryptocurrency’s market cap standing slightly below $91 billion. Accordingly, around $60 billion has been offered since the week commencing March 9th 2020 as investors liquidate their crypto positions in a bit to mitigate their losses.

While uncertainty and panic has infiltrated the market, stablecoins have been identified as a place for investors to seek solace. In mid March, six stablecoins entered the top 50 crypto assets based on their respective capitalisation. Interest in Maker DAO’s flagship stablecoin, the DAI has even seen the organisation add a third asset to its DeFi decentralised platform in a bit to keep the currency floating above its dollar peg.

Reasons for optimism

Despite widespread fears, the Dollar-backed stablecoin market has shown some degree of solidity, with stablecoins like Tether (USDT), Paxos and Timvi (TMV) all seeing strong prices and trading volume in recent days. Notably, stablecoins have surpassed a total market capitalization of $6 billion in the wake of Coronavirus.

Interest in stablecoins has been steadily rising during the coronavirus outbreak due to their relative security based on the real-world assets that they’re pegged to.

Their stability has been a driving force in boosting investor confidence in these digital assets, and increasing numbers of traders are now looking to stablecoins as a method of storing their wealth as well as a useful method of payment outside of the troubled fiat currencies.

How to invest wisely

There’s a growing case to be made that the emerging bear market could make for ample grounds for value investments.

This means that investors could use the falling values of the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum to make purchases as a way of speculating on an eventual return to form for the digital currencies.

This approach could be seen as a solid option if you’re of the belief that the falling values of Bitcoin and other altcoins is down, in most part, to market jitters and will return to its previous values once concerns over Coronavirus have eased.

However, the danger remains that, while there’s little reason to suggest that the cryptocurrency market won’t recover from this setback, its recovery will likely be linked to a return to productivity within China and its large number of miners. With it looking like a long recovery process for the nation, along with much of Europe and the USA declaring states of emergency, it could take some time before Bitcoin is back to pushing $10,000 in value – meaning that investors may need to look elsewhere to get the better of the bear market.

Herein lies the convenience of stablecoins. With their values pegged to real-world assets like the US Dollar and gold, there’s less chance of investors experiencing the sort of crippling drops that the rest of the crypto market is experiencing due to the levels of volatility associated with this significant event.

In times of unprecedented levels of uncertainty, it’s worth looking away from speculative markets and investing in some short-term stability. To invest wisely in this time of uncertainty, the safest bet available is for investors to hold assets in the stablecoins market. This allows them to remain connected to the crypto markets but secure themselves with pegged currencies. When there’s enough evidence that the bear market has been banished, there could be plenty of opportunities available as share prices recover.","Sources told the Financial Times that Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is raising another crypto fund, reportedly targeted at $450 million.

In brief Pornhub and Stripchat have seen a 25% increase in traffic since the coronavirus lockdown started.

Crypto payments are on the rise on several adult platforms.

Some performers only see Bitcoin as suitable for tipping.

With the world in lockdown, the porn industry has witnessed a huge surge in traffic. Both Stripchat and Pornhub have seen traffic in the US rise by 25%, with Stripchat noting a threefold surge in daily sign-ups in coronavirus-hit areas, such as Italy. Pornstars, such as Brenna Sparks, have seen big increases in their number of subscribers. Business is booming.

But in meatspace, adult performers are struggling. Social distancing requirements make it harder for them to work. Many are going online to make a living—but it’s harder to get paid when they’re not using cash, with banks regularly closing down accounts. Many performers are turning to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments to survive the pandemic.

“Crypto payments are up 59% since March 1,” a Stripchat spokesperson told Decrypt.

Adult streaming platform SpankChain has seen a similar rise in cryptocurrency use. SpankPay, the company's crypto payment processor, allows models to accept a variety of crypto, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

""We saw a 40% increase in the number of payments through SpankPay for erotic media last month,"" said SpankChain CEO Ameen Soleimani.

""The cam models and clip artists are largely doing OK, but many sex workers offering physical services (strippers, etc...) who were the most impacted are now going digital and offering content and companionship through online platforms,"" he said.

Pornstar Brenna Sparks agreed. She said that, while she is happy to use the US dollar, it’s not always the best option.

""When it comes to online models, the story is a bit different. Many of the models live in areas with an unstable currency, so accepting Bitcoin is an extremely important preventative measure they can take today to defend themselves from the inevitable—the collapse of their country's currency.""

More Bitcoin adoption yet to come

“Iconic3ileen,” a model in the top 3% of creators on Only Fans, told Decrypt that business was ""booming"" during quarantine. However, when asked about crypto payments, she explained that they weren't practical enough to live off.

I would accept crypto as a form of tip,"" she says, ""but for actual content purchases, I'd rather use currency until I can pay bills and buy groceries with cryptocurrency.""

While Chaturbate noted a modest uptick in new users, it didn’t see a particular increase in Bitcoin payments on the site.

But with Bitcoin mining porn now a thing, it might see Bitcoin adoption, just in another way.","Riot Blockchain, one of the few publicly traded bitcoin mining companies in the U.S., has executed a co-location mining services contract with a crypto data center Coinmint.

Announced Tuesday, the Colorado-based firm will send a portion of its S17 bitcoin mining machines from its facilities in Oklahoma City to Coinmint’s power plant in upstate New York.

The move came two months after Riot purchased 1,060 Bitmain S17 Pro Antminers for that facility. The addition is part of Riot’s recent expansion in bitcoin mining.

The firm bought 4,000 miners from Bitmain with $6.35 million in December and installed 3,000 miners in the following month. The firm expects to boost its computing capacity by 240 percent with the latest addition.

“Riot believes the hosting arrangement can positively impact its power costs, the Oklahoma City facility’s heat and environmental operating issues, and provide a path to diversify its mining operations,” Riot said in a statement.

According to the contract, Coinmint’s Massena, N.Y., facility will be responsible for initial operational, security and reporting controls testing and verification. As one of the largest crypto data centers in the U.S., Coinmint claims to have 435 megawatts of transformer capacity. It was converted to a data center from an aluminum smelter in 2016.

The plant can generate excess power in part due to the abundant hydroelectric and wind generation in the area. Its management experiences in wholesale electricity markets is another economic advantage for Coinmint to operate mining machines, according to Riot.

Riot has also assessed how COVID-19’s impact on its relocation plan and concluded that the novel coronavirus’ risks are reasonably mitigated due to the “plug and play ” infrastructure of Coinmint’s facilities. “To date, the impact has remained minimal,” Riot said.

Riot’s rearrangement with its mining facilities could also be part of its shift from crypto trading to bitcoin mining businesses. The firm has been on the lookout for potential buyers for its crypto trading platform RiotX since February.","Digital asset exchange Bitfinex has the most liquid bitcoin and ethereum pairs, based upon order book depth analysis by The Block.

While trading volume is a headline figure showcased by many cryptocurrency exchanges, the level of liquidity offers a far more valuable insight into the quality of trade execution and transaction costs, particularly in the turbulent conditions that have characterised recent cryptocurrency markets. High liquidity provides traders with tighter spreads and lower slippage.

The Block’s research, which analysed the order book depth for US Dollar pairs for bitcoin, ethereum and ripple's XRP on 21 leading cryptocurrency exchanges, found that Bitfinex has by far the most liquid bitcoin pair with combined orders of USD60 million. Furthermore, Bitfinex was found to have the most liquid ethereum pair, with combined orders of USD12.6 million.

“When high levels of volatility happens, as was the case on March 12/13 when the price of Bitcoin plunged by 50 per cent, Bitfinex’s order book liquidity demonstrates its true power,” says Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Bitfinex. “On crypto exchanges, volume can be made by market makers that all quote small sizes near the top of the book. Liquidity is much more precious and harder to replicate. In this regard, Bitfinex is king.”

The crypto market crash on March 12/13 saw daily volumes hit USD75.9 billion in a single day (13 March), representing the single greatest daily volume recorded in crypto asset history, according to research by CryptoCompare, a specialist provider of market data in the digital asset space. Bitfinex’s position as the go-to place to trade, providing genuine liquidity, was most apparent during the first hour of bitcoin’s massive 50 per cent price drop, according to CryptoCompare. Among top-tier exchanges excluding Coinbase, OKEx and Bitstamp, “between 10:40 am and 11 am, it represented 40 per cent of volume on average among these exchanges,” the report found. During the brief period, Bitfinex was handling up to USD11.8 million worth of trades per minute.

Bitfinex is leveraging its position as a one-stop-shop for crypto trading, offering a variety of services, including margin trading with up to five-times leverage. The exchange also offers users access to a separate, perpetual swap contract offering 100-times leverage through its affiliate, iFinex Financial Technologies Limited.","Bitcoin Casino has been around since 2019 and it is under the ownership of Direx N.V.

Visit BitcoinCasino","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned that fraudsters are about to unleash a surge of coronavirus cryptocurrency scams globally leveraging increased fear and uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic to steal your money and launder it through the complex cryptocurrency ecosystem.

According to the bureau, these scams will be global regardless of where you live and you thus need to take some precautions.

In a statement on its website, the FBI said:

“People of all ages, including the elderly, are being victimized by criminals through cryptocurrency-related fraud schemes. Developments in cryptocurrency technology and an increasing number of businesses accepting it as payment have driven the growing popularity and accessibility of cryptocurrency. There are not only numerous virtual asset service providers online but also thousands of cryptocurrency kiosks located throughout the world which are exploited by criminals to facilitate their schemes. Many traditional financial crimes and money laundering schemes are now orchestrated via cryptocurrencies.”

The FBI advises you to be on the lookout for an increase in the following cryptocurrency fraud schemes related to COVID-19:

Blackmail Attempts – Threatening emails or letters in which scammers claim to have access to your personal information or knowledge of your “dirty secrets” and demand payment in Bitcoin to prevent release of this information have been circulating for years. With the advent of COVID-19, there is a new twist on this scam. The correspondence claims that the writer will both release your information and infect you and/or your family with coronavirus unless payment is sent to a Bitcoin wallet.

Work from Home Scams – Scammers, posing as employers, may ask you to accept a “donation” of funds into your own bank account and to deposit them into a crypto kiosk. The so-called “donation” is likely money stolen from others. Your acceptance and transfer of the stolen money is considered illegal money mule activity and potentially unlicensed money transmission.

Investment Scams – Criminals often pitch fraudulent investments in a “new” and developing cryptocurrency, such as an initial coin offering (ICO) or other investment vehicle to take a victim’s money. These scams typically involve scenarios that seem “too good to be true”—offering large monetary returns for a short-term, small investment. The reality is that scammers steal the investment money for personal use and utilize the complexities of cryptocurrency to hide the true destination of the stolen funds.

Although there are legitimate charities, investment platforms, and e-commerce sites that accept payment in cryptocurrency, according to the FBI, pressure to use a virtual currency should be considered a significant red flag.

By remembering the following tips regarding finances and cryptocurrency, you can better protect yourself from fraud:

Verify that a vendor/charity is legitimate and accepts cryptocurrency before sending payments/donations.

2020-04-15,"Bitcoin advocate Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano is betting the top cryptocurrency might have more of a role to play in the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

Pompliano‘s Morgan Creek Digital was one of the investors in a $2.45 million seed round for Atomic Loans, a Canadian startup looking to create bitcoin-backed lending instruments.

Announced Wednesday, the seed round was led by Initialized Capital – an investor in Coinbase – with participation also coming from the founders of blockchain protocol provider Bison Trails and ConsenSys, a prominent financial backer in the ethereum ecosystem. ConsenSys previously invested in the startup’s pre-seed round in 2019.

The idea behind Atomic Loans is to allow bitcoin holders to leverage the dollar value of their assets on the Ethereum protocol. A user can borrow Ethereum-based stablecoins using bitcoin as collateral and redeem at any time. The funding will be spent on further research and development, the project said.

Pompliano has built a reputation on espousing a strongly bullish attitude towards cryptocurrencies, and in particular bitcoin. He is a regular panelist on various U.S. market shows, often advocating for greater crypto adoption among traditional investors. He claimed on NBC’s “Shark Tank” last August to hold half his net worth in bitcoin.

In a statement, Pompliano said: “Atomic Loans is building the decentralized financial infrastructure that uses Bitcoin how it was intended.” Such initiatives, he added, help prove the original cryptocurrency would form the basis for an “alternate financial system.”

Although bitcoin has so far played a minor role in DeFi, other teams are trying to leverage its $123 billion market value. Projects such as Wanchain, Wrapped Bitcoin and Trustless Bitcoin have all focused on creating Ethereum wrappers for bitcoin.

The main difference with Atomic Loans is users can lock in their holding’s dollar value, giving them the option to benefit from any possible upside. Brett Gibson, a partner at Initialized Capital, said the startup gave DeFi simple access to the “largest and most valuable crypto-asset.”

“Atomic Loans is leveraging their deep expertise in Bitcoin scripting and atomic swaps to create a useful DeFi product that works on the Bitcoin blockchain directly without requiring complex synthetics on other blockchains.”","The director of business development at Kraken says he believes that the environment is ripe for Bitcoin to begin a major long-term bull run.

In a new YouTube interview with Lark Davis, aka the Crypto Lark, Dan Held explains why he thinks Bitcoin’s time has come.

So far, Held argues, Bitcoin has managed to weather the worst of the coronavirus pandemic without the need for intervention.

“We’ve got a halvening. We’ve got a huge macro backdrop where banks are literally printing a million dollars a second, which happened a few weeks ago with the US, the Fed and the Treasury. And so, there couldn’t be a better moment for Bitcoin than now. I’ve waited eight years to see this.”

The crypto exchange executive says the industry as a whole has grown immensely over the years, citing the rise in the number of investors holding onto BTC as well as an increase in mainstream coverage from outlets like CNBC.

According to Held, the current macro backdrop is fuel for the world’s leading cryptocurrency, considering its limited total supply of 21 million units. Optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, Held points to a contrarian argument that BTC could begin a “super cycle” and move far beyond even the most bullish predictions.

“We’re seeing a scenario where there’s a literal infinite amount of fiat that will be printed, and there’s only 21 million Bitcoin. It’s hard to predict, but long-term, maybe late 2021, is when a lot of the models predict what we might see in historical cycles. The classic models show us at $80,000 to $300,000 per Bitcoin. We could see that. We could see something a little crazier. I call this the Bitcoin super cycle.

We could see Bitcoin enter a super cycle where everyone’s seen that graph of Bitcoin’s price – that log price graph, and you get a little boom bust, boom bust, boom bust. But what if [BTC] went a level step up on a log chart?

If the world truly fears their money being devalued – every institution, every sovereign wealth fund, every central bank – if they all truly fear that, Bitcoin’s not going to stop at $100,000 or $300,000. It could go up to a million or two.”

Despite his optimism, Held warns that Bitcoin is not for everyone, and says anyone considering an investment in the extremely risky asset must be prepared for BTC to lose 85% of its value at any time.

“After you get through your first time of losing 85% of your net worth – that’s happened to me three times. Early 2013, late 2013 and 2017… It’s really fucking hard to hodl Bitcoin. The volatility is so intense…

Satoshi actually hypothesized that Bitcoin’s intense volatility would act as a viral loop bringing people into Bitcoin. He said, as the price increases, more people [will] become aware of it, and wanting to take advantage of the increasing value they buy in, which then further pumps up the price and brings more awareness. And he wrote this before Bitcoin was worth a penny.

So Satoshi very intimately understood human psychology.

And all my bet really is, is will people choose to preserve their wealth? Which is almost unanimously yes. And will they act greedy? And both are kind of one and the same, and I think we can assume humans will act like humans.”

Google has removed 49 cryptocurrency wallet browser extensions after a security researcher discovered they were stealing private keys. These Chrome extensions targeted users of crypto wallets, such as Ledger, Trezor, Jaxx, Electrum, Myetherwallet, Metamask, Exodus, and Keepkey.

49 Malicious Chrome Browser Extensions

Security researcher Harry Denley revealed on Tuesday that 49 Chrome browser extensions have been stealing users’ cryptocurrency wallet private keys. Denley is the director of security at Mycrypto, an open-source tool for generating ether wallets and handling ERC20 tokens.

Posing as legitimate cryptocurrency wallet extensions, the 49 fake Chrome browser extensions contained malicious code that stole private keys, mnemonic phrases, and keystore files, the director described. They gathered data entered during different wallet configuration steps and sent them to one of the attacker’s servers or a Google Form. Some of these fraudulent browser extensions even had a network of fake users rating them with five stars or positive feedback. According to Denley, the extensions appear to be the work of one person or a group of people who are likely to be based in Russia.

The Targeted Cryptocurrency Wallets

Denley further revealed that the cryptocurrency wallets targeted by the 49 malicious Chrome browser extensions were Ledger, Trezor, Jaxx, Electrum, Myetherwallet, Metamask, Exodus, and Keepkey. He found that the most attacked wallet was Ledger, targeted by 57% of the malicious browser extensions. The second most targeted wallet was Myetherwallet (22%), followed by Trezor (8%), Electrum (4%), Keepkey (4%), and Jaxx (2%).

During his test, the security researcher sent funds to a few addresses and entered some secrets. He found that the funds sent were not automatically swept, concluding that the attackers were either only interested in high-value accounts or had to manually empty the addresses. Moreover, he noted that the malicious extensions started to hit the Google Chrome store in February slowly and rapidly increased releases through April. He added that they were reported to Google and removed within 24 hours.

Link rose by 31 percent in the first quarter and was trading near $3.20 at press time, representing a 42 percent month-to-date (MTD) increase, according to data source Messari.

The cryptocurrency was registering a bigger MTD price gain of 62 percent over the weekend, when it was trading at a one-month high of $3.66.

While the 14th largest cryptocurrency is extending its Q1 ascent, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency, has eked out just 5 percent gains so far this month, having shed 10 percent of its value in the first quarter.

This being the cryptocurrency market, hype has played a role in the run-up.

“Link has a strong fan base that constantly promotes or ‘shills’ the project to potential buyers. This often creates a positive reinforcement cycle, further driving up the price,” Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk.

But recently Chainlink has given those promoters something to talk about: its association with a new project called the Baseline Protocol and partnerships in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which have generated hype for the project.

Enterprise applications

Chainlink is a system of oracles built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. An oracle is a third-party information source that supplies data to blockchains. If someone buys insurance against an earthquake or hurricane, for example, an oracle would tell the smart contract when such a disaster occurs so it can pay the policyholder. The link token, in turn, is used to pay Chainlink node operators for providing these services.

The Baseline Protocol, formed by EY and Consensys in collaboration with Microsoft in March, is an open source initiative that combines advances in blockchain, cryptography and messaging with the goal of delivering secure and private business processes at low cost through the public Ethereum mainnet.

Chainlink joined forces with the founders in developing the eponymous baseline protocol.

“People are incredibly excited for Chainlink to help usher in an era of mainnet enterprise applications as a part of initiatives like the Baseline Protocol,” said Vance Spencer, co-founder of technology company Framework Ventures, which is one of the largest private holders of LINK tokens.

Some observers think Chainlink would serve best in such baseline protocols as a facilitator or oracle for all moving parts in the new business network and could continue to benefit from the ongoing shift in focus from base layer chains to the middleware services that provide security for data feeds.

“The boundaries between classically defined smart contracts and oracles have started to dissolve,” Spencer said. “This has reframed narratives surrounding smart contracts, pushing expectations of trustlessness and, therefore, valuation from base layer blockchains to the oracles that service them. Chainlink is by far the best of breed approach, team and product in a space that we increasingly see as winner-take-all.”

Dominating DeFi

The DeFi industry turned to Chainlink, which draws asset prices from multiple sources to inform smart contracts, after multiple hacks on lending platform bZx in February exposed risks arising from using a single source for such data.

“Link has gained some notoriety due to the protocol’s variety of use cases, particularly their decentralized price reference data feeds, which are used by various DeFi protocols such as Synthetix and bZx,” Abendschein said.

bZx attackers were able to manipulate asset prices and make sizable money mainly because the platform used Kyber Network as a single oracle, or supplier of asset prices.

An attacker’s job becomes difficult with the use of multiple price inputs as manipulation on one platform does not meaningfully affect the end result of the transaction.

Lending platforms bZx, Aave, Celsuis network and Synthetix have partnered with Chainlink for secure oracle solutions.

Chainlink claims its decentralized oracle network can vastly expand the functionality of DeFi smart contracts, increase the variety of products offered, and make the market more enticing for regulated players to participate within. If that proves true, the cryptocurrency could continue to outperform bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies.","TradeStation is plugging into crypto exchange ErisX as it seeks to enhance digital asset trading for its pro and institutional clients.

The online brokerage and trading technology firm said Wednesday it is integrating ErisX’s order book into its subsidiary, TradeStation Crypto, to provide clients with deeper liquidity and tighter spreads when trading digital assets.

Both TradeStation and ErisX believe the tie-up will take market infrastructure up to the same sort of standards as already exist in traditional markets. They hope to coax a new generation of participants – who may trade other assets but are uncertain about digital assets – into dipping a toe into the crypto trading space.

“Adding this digital-asset exchange relationship helps improve our customers’ view of prices across more connected markets,” said James Putra, TradeStation Crypto’s director of product strategy. ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas said just working with an established name like TradeStation would help instill confidence in traders interested in the new asset class.

TradeStation – which only opened its crypto brokerage last May – offers brokerage and tech solutions for active traders. It generally focuses on professional clients, which include hedge funds, family offices and money managers.

These clients will now be able to access ErisX in order to trade bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ether.

TradeStation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Japanese financial services group Monex. Among its other holdings, the group owns a cryptocurrency research and development house as well as CoinCheck, acquired after that exchange fell victim to a $500 million hack in early 2018.

Launching initially as a cash-settled derivative swaps exchange in 2010, ErisX pivoted into cryptocurrencies during the boom time in 2017. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved it as a registered clearing organization in July 2019, and the exchange started offering physically settled bitcoin derivatives back in December.

Institutional-facing Fidelity Digital Assets became a member of ErisX’s clearinghouse just last week, using the exchange’s orderbook for liquidity and to minimize counterparty risk. Chippas didn’t disclose the number of entities using its clearinghouse, but told CoinDesk at the time that TradeStation was a member.","Is physical gold leaving digital gold behind?

It’s a question worth asking, with the yellow metal having rallied over the past four trading sessions to reach a new eight-year high, around $1,725 an ounce.

And what about bitcoin, seen by many investors as a digital form of gold due to its perceived use as a hedge against inflation? It’s down 4.1 percent on the year.

Source: TradingView

The gap between gold and bitcoin returns has frustrated traders who predict that trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related emergency aid and monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve and other authorities will eventually lead to inflation.

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday estimated that the global economy will shrink 3 percent this year, down some 6.3 percentage points below its most-recent projection in January. What’s changed, of course, is the pandemic, which has led to business disruptions and travel cancellations while cratering energy demand and decimating consumer spending.

“The magnitude and speed of collapse in activity that has followed is unlike anything experienced in our lifetimes,” the Washington-based organization’s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, wrote in a blog post.

Recessions are often deflationary: Lower demand alleviates upward price pressure on products and services, while surging unemployment makes it harder for workers to demand wage increases. Deutsche Bank says a U.S. government report on Thursday might reveal another eight million jobless claims filed last week, bringing the four-week total to 25 million – at least 10 times worse than any prior comparable period in the past half-century. The unemployment rate would rise to 17 percent, from 3.5 percent as recently as February.

Federal Reserve officials appear determined to keep inflation at bay. The central bank targets annual price rises of 2 percent, and Vice Chair Richard Clarida told Bloomberg Television that monetary authorities “have the tools to keep the economy out of deflation.” Translation: More money injections are likely. Last week, the Fed’s balance sheet ballooned past $6 trillion for the first time in its 107-year history.

So why isn’t bitcoin getting the uplift that gold is enjoying?

One possible reason, according to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency-focused firm Arca Funds, is the physical metal is so much easier to buy. That’s especially true for traditional investors who have long turned to gold as a safe haven during times of economic and market turmoil.

“Gold can easily be purchased from the same brokerage accounts as stocks/bonds, whereas bitcoin cannot be,” Dorman told CoinDesk in an email. “Anyone who sold equities or debt and is sitting in cash needs to put that money to work, and it’s easier to purchase gold than bitcoin.”

It’s as plausible an explanation as any, given that bitcoin was launched just 11 years ago, while gold has served as a symbol of riches at least since the Sumerians civilized Mesopotamia.

According to the World Gold Council, an estimated 197,576 metric tons of gold have been mined throughout history. At 32,150.75 troy ounces per metric ton, and based on the current price, that works out to an outstanding value of about $11 trillion. That’s 87 times the outstanding market value of all bitcoin ever produced, currently about $125 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. “People that have money, investment capital, they’re definitely more familiar with gold,” says Phillip Meng, who until recently was head of trading for SFOX, a cryptocurrency trading platform. “Gold is definitely preferable to bitcoin at this point because of just the understanding of the asset and access to the asset.” In extremely uncertain times, people might simply gravitate toward things that are more certain. “I am skeptical that in the time of a severe recession, people would want to deal with an electronic type of entity,” Frank Shostak, an associated scholar of the Mises Institute and chief economist and director of AAS Economics, told CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole on Tuesday. Bitcoin has been touted by some proponents as an uncorrelated asset that can help to increase returns in an investment portfolio while reducing overall volatility and risk. But that hasn’t stopped analysts from spotting occasional periods where bitcoin seems to trade in sync with counterparts from traditional finance, from gold to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks to the dollar’s exchange rate with the Chinese yuan. In a report published Tuesday, Coin Metrics, a digital-asset research and data firm, ran the math on bitcoin’s correlation with gold. Historically, the correlation hasn’t been strong, wrote the analysts, led by Nate Maddrey.

But since March 12, the depth of the coronavirus sell-off for bitcoin, the correlation with gold has increased. It’s still pretty weak, currently at less than 0.5, where 1 represents perfect synchronicity, 0 is no correlation at all and -1 is a perfectly inverse relationship:

Source: Coin Metrics

“These are small pieces of evidence that the correlation between bitcoin and gold may be growing,” according to Maddrey and the Coin Metrics team. “However, bitcoin’s overall correlation with gold is still relatively weak.”

What might be just as interesting, if not more, is that, recently at least, bitcoin does appear to be trading in sync with inflation expectations. The Coin Metrics team analyzed the cryptocurrency’s correlation with the 5-year forward inflation expectation rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Here’s what that looks like:

It’s a pretty stark up-slope at the far-right end of the chart.

The takeaway?

“Although the short term is still uncertain amidst the global pandemic, this could potentially be a long-term inflection point for bitcoin if federal banks around the world continue to inject money into the global economy at historic rates,” according to the report.

There may be hope yet for the bitcoin bugs.

Tweet of the day

Bitcoin watch

Trend: Bitcoin is lacking a clear directional bias for the second day with prices trapped in the $6,600–$7,200 range.

The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization ran into offers near $7,200 over the weekend, as indicated by the long upper wick attached to Sunday’s candle. However, the ensuing price dip found buyers near $6,600 on Monday.

The outlook will remain neutral as long as the $600 range is intact. A move above the top end would open the doors for a rally to $7,800 (target as per the measured move method) – a level last seen before the March 12 crash. Alternatively, a range breakdown could encourage sellers and yield a drop to $6,100.

The bearish scenario looks most likely currently, as bitcoin’s repeated failure to keep gains above the 100-week average of $7,060 over the last two weeks is indicative of bull fatigue. Further, S&P 500 futures are flashing red at press time, alongside losses in the European equities. Investors are selling risk assets, possibly in response to the International Monetary Fund’s forecast of a 3 percent contraction in global GDP in 2020.

That said, losses in both stocks and bitcoin could be limited, with the Federal Reserve injecting an unprecedented amount of liquidity into the system via its open-ended asset purchase program.

Professional investors are also sitting on record amounts of cash, some of which may make its way into the bitcoin market ahead of the next month’s reward halving. The event, aimed at controlling inflation, will reduce the amount of bitcoin created every 10 minutes or so from 12.5 BTC to 6.25.","The global economy is experiencing massive shockwaves due to the continuing global coronavirus pandemic. Markets are at record levels of volatility, seeing historic swings in both directions on a near-daily basis. In the midst of the crisis, pundits and talking heads on television are switching tunes like a DJ quickly rotating through songs. One day they believe the bottom is in, while the next they are screaming for a repeat of the Great Depression.

As all of this occurs investors are scared and while they should be nervous, it’s also good to have a plan of action for when catastrophic market events occur. A frequent question I receive is, how should the average retail investor assess risk and navigate these rough seas?

First, it is important to remember that we have been here before. While the reason for the economic crisis is different this time, recessions, depressions and corrections are a part of natural market cycles. To that end, the first thing to remember is never to panic or make decisions out of fear.

The stock market has always recovered in the past - in fact, there has never been a time in the history of the market that stocks have been a bad investment over a 10 year period. Equities have yielded at least a 7% gain over that time frame at every point since inception.

To state it plainly - dips have always been for buying on stocks if you have a long time horizon as an investor. Even the Great Depression was a buying opportunity for savvy investors.

With that in mind, here are some practical tips for handling your portfolio and tightening up your risk management during this trying time.

1. Keep investing for retirement

Anyone who is not yet retired should maintain the same strategy that they had before the crisis, passively investing and dollar-cost averaging into the stock market in a tax-deferred fund like a 401K or IRA.

While it is scary to see your net worth dropping, your retirement fund is focused on growing your capital over many decades. An economic crisis is more likely a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity when viewed with a long time horizon. Just imagine, in 10 years, this downturn will likely be a blip and the equities you purchased will have been obtained at a significant discount.

If you were in the market during the 2008 financial crisis and experienced a portfolio drop of more than 50%, then you also know that sticking to your plan was effective. Remember, a new bull market started in 2009 and continued until the start of March 2020.

Focus on the fact that stocks will recover, without worrying about when.

If you are retired, then you have likely already rebalanced heavily into bonds and cash, which are both stable. That’s why you reduce exposure to riskier assets over time.

2. Increase your emergency fund

Having emergency savings is always crucial and general financial guidance suggests that everyone should have cash set aside to cover at least 3 to 12 months’ worth of living expenses in case one loses their job.

Such a fund is even more essential during a time of global economic crisis, with record unemployment and market uncertainty. Assuming you still have income, it's a good idea to set some of the money aside to increase your cash savings for further emergencies.

3. Cash is king

As an investor and trader, I always keep at least 15% of my portfolio in cash - this is different from my emergency fund. Cash is an essential part of any portfolio and risk management strategy because it’s value increases during a downturn.

If you have cash in your crypto portfolio and treat it as an asset, you will notice that the Bitcoin value of your portfolio rises when Bitcoin price drops - because the cash is “beating” Bitcoin. You need to cash to be flexible and able to buy dips. Never be fully deployed.

The thinking is the same as with equities. The buying power of your cash increases as equities become cheaper. There is a reason that Warren Buffett is sitting on a $125 billion mound of cash. It’s because he’s waiting to buy distressed assets. You can do the same.

Furthermore, recent demand from companies and countries all over the world has created a shortage of dollars because they often hoard more of the currency than they immediately need in response to fears about the coronavirus.

In times of trouble, people want dollars. The dollar is still the only true safe-haven asset regardless of how many the Federal Reserve continues to print. It is the world's reserve currency

4. Buy Bitcoin

Any hedge fund manager or individual who performs a risk assessment of their portfolio should come to the same conclusion - buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin and crypto in general, is arguably the only truly uncorrelated asset in the world, meaning that its value is not determined by the same underlying factors as everything else. This offers idiosyncratic risk in your portfolio, as opposed to the systematic risk from every other asset.

I personally believe that everyone should have a small investment in Bitcoin because it offers insurance against inflationary currency and bad actors. This is crucial for proper risk management.

As a retail investor, the best way to invest in Bitcoin is to dollar cost average. Dollar-cost averaging removes the guesswork and risk of buying all at once and it is a price agnostic strategy that allows you to buy dips over the long term in a trending market.

This is basically no different than passively investing in equities via a retirement fund. I buy Bitcoin almost every day, regardless of price, in small amounts for my long term portfolio.

5. Crypto investors should diversify

Nobody should be 100% invested in anything. Period. Even the most hardcore Bitcoin maximalist should have a diversified portfolio with exposure to multiple assets. The present economic crisis could be a great opportunity for crypto investors to buy cheap equities, real estate and bonds to improve their risk management.

People around the world are struggling right now. There is increasing concern that the global economy will remain shut down for an extended period of time and that more jobs will be lost. By properly managing your portfolio risk, you can safely navigate through some money-related concerns by making excellent investment decisions that will bear fruit over the long run.

Central banks are concerned about the widespread adoption of stablecoins threatening the global financial system. As they make recommendations to heavily regulate or even ban them, the Crypto market now faces its biggest threat yet.

Financial Stability Board (FSB) Recommendations Brutal for Digital Assets

In a document published yesterday, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) outlined its concerns about stablecoins in the global financial market. Since stablecoins “enhance the efficiency of the provision of financial services,” that’s a problem for the status quo.

Widespread adoption, they believe, would give rise to an independent financial system out of their control. It could even replace fiat currencies and “exacerbate bank runs.”

The fears of the risks stablecoins used by the crypto market pose to financial stability have long been backed by countries like China and France. The French AMF last week recommended that the EU create specific regulations for stablecoins stating that they posed “systemic risks” to the Union.åç

Among the FSH guidelines are many recommendations that fall short of an outright ban. These include urging local central banks to comprehensively regulate, supervise, and control stablecoins. They also suggest that governance frameworks are put in place to identify accountability and ensure that all stablecoins provide transparent information.

The recommendations do, however, go as far as to say that local authorities should ban stablecoins completely if needed, including those that run on fully decentralized systems, like crypto networks such as Ethereum.

Crypto Market Could Suffer Greatly From Stablecoin Ban

A ban on stablecoins could be potentially very scary, indeed. To start with, it would practically wipe out the entire DeFi movement and projects like MakerDAO and Compound. Worse still, it could cause an overreaching liquidity crisis across the market.

Just consider stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD) that are both backed by the US dollar. For many users around the world, stablecoins are crucial in trading crypto assets like bitcoin.

Let’s take powerhouse Binance as the best example. Currently, it is number one in terms of trading volume. Yet Binance only uses stablecoins like Tether, Binance USD, and Paxos Dollar. As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, there is $1bn of USDT sitting on Binance right now.

This is a positive sign for crypto as it suggests that traders are steadily sending their stablecoins to the exchange in order to scoop up crypto assets. It appears that many investors are waiting for the right time to convert their holdings to BTC and potentially sparking a new rally. Yet all that could be halted if the FSB recommendations are adopted.

In practice, they may not result in an actual ban. However, they could subject cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers to the same scrutinous regulations as banks and other FSIs. This could push many projects and companies out of business.

And an outright ban that sees behemoth stablecoins like Tether leave the market could also see a mass exodus of traders and a liquidity crisis like nothing the crypto market has previously faced.","Hut 8 Mining Group, a publicly traded cryptocurrency mining firm, is concerned about coronavirus-related delays of new machine deliveries from potential suppliers such as Bitmain and MicroBT.

During an earnings call last week, CEO Andrew Kiguel said his firm was grappling with a vague timeline for the delivery of crypto mining machines to support its farms, saying that while in February, “you thought” machines could be delivered between March and April, these timelines have since shifted due to the ongoing pandemic. He did not have a revised timeline either.

His remarks follow guidance from competitor Riot Blockchain, which also warned the novel coronavirus outbreak would impact its business operations.

“Three or four weeks ago, nobody thought these things would be an issue, and the world is grappling right now with different supply chain issues like getting ventilators and masks around the world as opposed to bitcoin mining machines,” Kiguel said.

Bitmain was one of several Chinese miner manufacturers that warned as far back as January – close to eight weeks ago – it would be forced to delay deliveries due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Bitmain has since resumed operations, though its delivery timetable is still unclear.

Halving concerns

Hut 8 Mining Group, one of the few publicly traded mining firms in the U.S., is also closely watching the upcoming bitcoin halving in hopes of appropriately scaling the size of its mining farm.

The Canadian firm is set to have a higher stake in the bitcoin market after launching its core operation in the middle of 2018 and acquiring facilities to boost its mining power last year. According to its year-end report for 2019, released on Monday, Hut 8 saw $58.6 million in revenue, up by 66 percent from the prior year, thanks to larger capacity and higher bitcoin price.

This places it as one of the productive miners in North America among its competition, including the Colorado-based Riot Blockchain.

Hut8’s coronavirus concerns come as the firm prepares for bitcoin’s hotly anticipated halving, tentatively set to occur in mid-May."
2020-04-16,"The use of the Ethereum network to move value around has shot to record levels.

A Wednesday tweet from Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari, revealed data showing the total value transferred on the Ethereum network, including ether and ERC-20 stablecoins, now matches that of the Bitcoin network.

The numbers show “Ethereum is becoming the dominant value transfer layer in crypto,” he said.

Value transfer refers to the U.S. dollar value of the total units on a blockchain that are transferred on a given day. With Bitcoin, the metric refers to the USD value of all the bitcoin sent on a given day.

Value transfer on Ethereum differs slightly. As well as its own ether cryptocurrency, Ethereum supports assets from third parties that can be sent and received over its network. For the above chart, value transfer on Ethereum refers to the USD value of both ETH and the Ethereum-based stablecoins that are transferred on on a given day.

Another chart from Messari show just how much the increase in the amount of value moved via USDT has boosted Ethereum’s numbers over the last few months.

Data dispute

Citing concerns about the validity of Watkins’ findings, independent developer Udi Wertheimer expressed his thoughts regarding the exclusion of Omni data, a software layer on the Bitcoin network that includes the issuance of the world’s most used stablecoin, tether (USDT). The Ethereum chart had included data for USDT issued as an ERC-20 token.

“USDT on Omni is bigger than all the non-USDT Ethereum-based stablecoins. If you include USDC and the smaller ones, you should also include Omni-USDT,” Wertheimer said.

But Watkins was quick to answer, arguing the conclusion remained the same.

“USDT transferred over Omni has dropped substantially as USDT has migrated over to Ethereum,” Watkins told CoinDesk.

“Furthermore, the amount of value transferred on Ethereum is slightly underestimated because it only includes the top stablecoins that CoinMetrics provides data for, and not all Ethereum-based tokens,” he said.

According to its “transparency” page, Tether said it has up to almost $4.9 billion USDT on Ethereum, while it has up to $1.55 billion on Omni.

New record

In his tweet thread, Watkins also noted stablecoins have just had their best quarter to date. Issuance in the first quarter of this year, he said, had “ballooned over $8 billion,” adding almost as much to the category’s market capitalization in Q1 as for all of 2019.

“Over the past two years, many stablecoin issuers have created stablecoins on Ethereum because of its flexible token standards that allow for the easy issuance and interoperability,” according to Watkins.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin is being withdrawn from exchanges at a rapid pace.

Bitcoin balances on exchanges are falling.

Bitcoin user behaviors could indicate bullish expectations prior to next months halving event.

Recent data indicates that Bitcoin holders are taking their coins off exchanges and moving them to wallets for longer-term holding. Is this a pre-halving hodling pattern?

Bitcoin Withdrawal Volumes Support the Hodl Narrative

According to analysis from data firm Glassnode, Bitcoin balances on exchanges have been falling precipitously for the last three months.

Cryptocurrencies tend to move to exchanges in anticipation of the need to trade, such as when prices are expected to fall. They tend to be withdrawn from exchanges when users want to hold them in wallets.

It appears Bitcoin is experiencing a rise in hodl culture.

Investors are withdrawing #Bitcoin from exchanges – potentially indicating a shift to longer-term holding strategies.$BTC balances have fallen nearly 10% from the highs seen in January.https://t.co/mMVqCQmkax pic.twitter.com/wccnWnM4ka — glassnode (@glassnode) April 14, 2020

As previously reported by Crypto Briefing, a hodl culture has been observed as a long-term trend in Bitcoin. Between 2011 to 2019, Bitcoin addresses holding over ten BTC tripled from around 50,000 to

Bitcoin’s third halving is roughly a month away. Block rewards will halve from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC.

The impact of halving events has been the subject of widespread and intense debate, but there is solid evidence that Bitcoin enjoys price gains for around a year following halvings.

Pre-Halving Hodling Pattern Emerges for 2020

Given last weeks’ BCH and BSV halvings, as well as ongoing wider economic woes as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, investors may have been prompted to eye the BTC halving and stock up on their Bitcoin holdings ahead of the event.

Not everyone is convinced that the halving will be bullish for Bitcoin’s price. Analysts at Strix Leviathan examined halving events across a range of cryptocurrencies and found that “assets experiencing a halving — both leading up to and following a halving — perform no better than the rest of the market.”

But hodler behavior over the past few months clearly indicates there has been a fundamental shift in sentiment. Bitcoin’s flight from exchanges cannot be explained by hacking fears, as hacks are becoming fewer and further between.

It is not unreasonable to assume that Bitcoin hodlers expect bullish activity, for one reason or another. Only time will tell if they are right.","Mass adoption. It’s a mantra touted often in this space and what every crypto company is working toward. While tremendous progress has been made in the past 10 years on driving crypto awareness and improving user experience, we still aren’t there yet in terms of mass utilization. In order for real adoption to occur, the crypto ecosystem needs to seamlessly interact with the existing financial system.

Think back to the very first time you bought Bitcoin (BTC). It’s scary.

You take your “real” money and put it into the computer to get back magic internet money. You need to move your newly purchased Bitcoin to a cold wallet for safe storage. You enter the destination wallet address, but have to triple-check it to make sure there are no errors. Once you finally click send, you don’t know if you’ve done it correctly because it takes time for the confirmations to occur (sometimes hours). Plus, if you lose your private key or seed of the destination wallet — your funds are gone forever.

All of us are early adopters in the crypto space and have navigated these waters, but the majority of people in the world won’t have that same experience. People want instant gratification and they want things to be simple. Unlike the internet, where people eventually learned how to send emails over the course of a decade, there is a real financial cost to making mistakes when learning how to use crypto. If I accidentally make a typo in an email address or put the wrong recipient, I can easily fix my mistake by resending the email to the right person. That’s not possible with cryptocurrency.

In order to drive mass adoption of cryptocurrency, companies need to give consumers all of the benefits of blockchain technology while having it seamlessly interact with the existing financial system they already understand. A cryptocurrency debit card, for instance. People worldwide already understand how debit cards work, plus Visa and Mastercard have spent decades getting their cards accepted at tens of millions of merchants around the world. The cardholder has the ability to easily spend cryptocurrency, while the merchant is receiving dollars as usual.

For example, someone who mines Bitcoin or trades altcoins may want to take their earnings to pay for everyday living expenses. That user then converts those crypto assets to United States dollars on an exchange, withdrawing from the exchange to their bank account, and then waiting a few days for those dollars to clear. All just to be able to spend on their bank-issued debit or credit card. A crypto debit card makes that process much easier and faster. Instead, that person can send crypto assets from their mining rig or exchange wallet, and those funds are almost immediately available to use wherever Visa or Mastercard is accepted. It’s the same outcome for the user, with less fees and more convenience.

Some will argue that merchants should accept cryptocurrency organically, rather than U.S. dollars. However, there are problems with this. First, many cryptocurrencies can be slow if the blockchain is congested, making it an inconsistent payment experience at the point of sale. While there are other crypto assets like Cardano (ADA), Nano (NANO), Ternio (TERN) or Litecoin (LTC) that have faster confirmations — it’s still possible they can take longer than a few seconds. When there is a long line at the grocery store or you’re running to catch a subway, you don’t want to wait to see if your payment has cleared.

Second, a grocery store can’t pay their employees in Bitcoin or buy goods from suppliers in BTC. The grocery store would need to make the conversion to U.S. dollars on their own for day-to-day operations. The volatility we’re all familiar with bears significant risk, and speculating on currency value is not something you want to do when running a business. Finally, there are no protections for the user if they pay the merchant for goods or services and the merchant does not deliver.

The same goes for bank accounts. Most people today get their pay direct-deposited into a checking account insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Your bank account is already linked to your employer, bill pay and multiple other sources — so switching banks is not something people do often. However, using services like automated clearing house or wire transfer takes too long and can be expensive. A stablecoin is much easier for instantaneous cross-border remittance. Blending the two is a powerful combination. The user avoids expensive fees or spread on forex conversions while still getting the convenience of blockchain’s benefits.

For example, a Chinese national could be studying at a university in the United States, but their family remains in China. That student may have a last-minute expense for books, rent or tuition. A family member in China can instantly convert a local currency to a crypto asset and send it directly to the student’s bank account within minutes at minimal fees — or even better, directly to the student’s crypto debit card for instant spending.

Wires typically take several days, cost roughly $45, and also calculate an approximate 10% conversion fee. Using blockchain will significantly reduce both time and costs, and when paired appropriately with bank accounts, still gives the student and their family the convenience of using the tools they are familiar with.

Ultimately, a hybrid setup of decentralized crypto assets paired with centralized custodians is going to be what brings in the masses. ACH, Wire, Visa and Mastercard will be the on and off ramp for consumers, while blockchain will enable the secure transfer of value that makes other systems antiquated. Companies need to enable consumers to get the benefits of new technology without a steep learning curve or drastically changing the user’s habits. People don’t care how technology works. They want instant gratification and as long as you are giving them technology that saves them money, time and makes their lives easier, they will gravitate to it.

Facebook's cryptocurrency project is taking a new, scaled-down approach as transactions increasingly take place online during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Libra Association, an independent group organized by Facebook to manage the libra crytocurrency, said it now plans to offer stable coins backed by just one nation's currency in addition to its coins backed by multiple currencies. That means some coins offered by the group would serve as the equivalent value of a U.S. dollar or a Euro, for example. The change comes after Facebook's plans for libra were shot down by lawmakers around the world who worried about a company with a history of privacy scandals having control over their citizens' resources.

The move represents a big change for libra, which Facebook originally pitched last year as an alternative global system that would make it easier to make digital payments no matter where in the world you are. The new proposed design for libra would make it more like standard digital payments services such as PayPal.

The change also could ease some concerns among U.S. lawmakers who feared the new currency could compete with the U.S. dollar. The Libra Association also said it's taking steps to make the currency more secure and safeguard it from illegal activity like money laundering.

David Marcus, the Facebook executive and former PayPal president who spearheaded the cryptocurrency initiative and is now a member of the Libra board, addressed the changes in a series of tweets Thursday.

""I keep on thinking about all the people and small businesses that could benefit from the Libra Network already being operational — especially now during these times of unprecedented hardship,"" he wrote.

Tweet

Marcus said the group is now fully funded by its members, with less than 10% of that funding coming from Facebook.

The Libra Association has seen a significant change in its makeup since the project was first announced. A slew of payments companies, including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, abandoned the project following government scrutiny. After losing eight of its original members, Shopify and crypto start-up Tagomi joined the Libra Association in February.

It's still unclear if the changes announced Thursday will be enough to sway regulators and policymakers in favor of the project. U.S. congressmen pressed Marcus and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a series of hearings last year, even asking them to halt plans for the currency altogether until they could come up with a proper regulatory framework. The executives only said they would wait to launch until they got approval from who they deemed were the appropriate U.S. regulators.

Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Tex., a member of the House Financial Services Committee that grilled Zuckerberg at a hearing about libra last year, does not seem entirely convinced by the new framework.

""Facebook and the Libra Association had an opportunity to address the concerns I and my other colleagues raised with their initial whitepaper,"" Garcia said in a statement Thursday. ""Unfortunately they chose not to listen to the bipartisan concerns raised about Libra. I will continue to work to make sure that the SEC regulates any such asset as the security that it is under current securities laws.""

The group is now waiting on regulatory guidance from the Swiss government. Libra said Thursday it had started the payment system licensing process with the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority (FINMA).

FINMA said in a statement Thursday that Libra's application ""differs considerably from the project originally submitted."" FINMA said it's committed to coordinating with international partners during its evaluation of the project due to its global implications. It said it has been working closely with the Swiss National Bank and more than 20 supervisory authorities and central banks around the world.

""FINMA will give special consideration to whether strict national and international standards for payment infrastructures and also for combating money laundering can be upheld,"" according to the statement.

WATCH: Facebook's libra head: I don't see bitcoin as currency, it's digital gold","OAKLAND, Calif. — When Facebook unveiled its Libra cryptocurrency project last June, the social networking company described it as a futuristic global money that could serve as the foundation for a new kind of financial system.

But on Thursday, Facebook and its partners rolled out a less ambitious design for Libra after the effort encountered numerous hurdles and heavy regulatory scrutiny.

No longer is the group focused on making Libra the basis of a new global financial system where Facebook could essentially play the roles of a central bank and Wall Street.

In a sign of the change, the Libra project will now focus on creating a more traditional payment network in which coins will be tied to a local currency, somewhat like the digital dollars in a PayPal account. While Libra will also have a coin backed by multiple national currencies, which was the focus of the initial design documents, that will be less prominent.","Facebook’s planned cryptocurrency Libra will be linked to individual national currencies and overseen by global watchdogs in a scaled-back revamp it hopes will win regulatory approval.

The prospect of Facebook’s 2.5 billion users adopting Libra has led to intense scrutiny from global regulators, with many worried its launch could erode national control over money.

Libra’s governing body, which is seeking the go-ahead from Switzerland’s markets watchdog, said on Thursday that it will now offer “stablecoins” backed by single currencies, as well as a redesigned token based on these currency-pegged coins.

The original plan was for Libra, which was unveiled last June, to be backed by a wide mixture of currencies and government debt. But central banks and regulators feared it could destabilize monetary policy, facilitate money laundering and erode users’ privacy, with some threatening to block it.

In response, the Libra Association, which will issue the coin and govern its network, said a “college” of central banks, regulators and enforcement agencies from more than 20 countries set up by Swiss watchdog FINMA will have a say in its bid to be licensed as a payments service provider in Switzerland.

The Geneva-based Libra Association declined to give details of the body’s membership and it was not immediately clear how major regulators would respond to Libra’s updated plans.

Libra, which had planned to launch by the end of June, now aims to do so between mid-November and the end of the year, Dante Disparte, its head of policy and communications, said.

Some countries, including France and Germany, had said they would seek to block Libra’s launch, while other global bodies scrambled to set out rules for stablecoins.

Until the advent of Libra, these had been a niche aspect of cryptocurrencies and barely featured on the regulatory radar.

Bitcoin, the biggest digital currency, is little-used in payments or commerce, in part because of its extreme volatility, and remains largely unregulated.

Libra’s most prominent original backers, including payments giants Mastercard, Visa and PayPal, ditched the project in the wake of the scrutiny.

Libra said it will now offer stablecoins based on a still-undecided line-up of individual currencies. It cited stablecoins based on the dollar, euro and sterling as possible examples.

Alongside these, Libra said it will also offer a revamped “Libra Coin,” a composite of some of the single-currency tokens, potentially for use in cross-border remittances.

“We’re retaining the construct of a multi-currency Libra, but it’s fundamentally changed, streamlined and simplified relative to the original one,” said Christian Catalini, head economist at Calibra, Facebook’s digital wallet, which will offer Libra via its Messenger and WhatsApp messaging platforms.

Libra also said it would bolster protections for the Libra Coin’s reserve in case of “extreme market distress.” The reserve will hold liquid assets with short-term maturity and low credit risk and a capital buffer, the level of which is undecided.

Another change is that Libra plans to strengthen safeguards on money laundering or terrorist financing. The Association will register with the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money services business, a move that would come with heightened record-keeping ad reporting requirements.

Central banks have accelerated their research on issuing their own digital currencies, known as CBDCs, in response to Libra, with China closest to launching one as issuance by Western central banks remains a distant prospect.

Adding to Libra’s original goals of bringing financial services to people who lack access to banks, Libra said the redesign would now help governments transform payments systems.

The revamp could allow governments to “directly integrate” any future CBDCs into its network, Libra said.","There has been an increase in the number of stablecoins issued over the past month, mainly on the Ethereum network. That popularity may also be lifting ether on Thursday.

Ether (ETH) prices have climbed 8.4 percent over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk price data as of 20:10 UTC (4:10 PM EDT )on Thursday.

Total supply of the top five fiat-backed stablecoins has increased by over 25 percent, primarily led by U.S. dollar-pegged tether (USDT) on the Ethereum network, with over $1.5 billion in issuance since March 12.

USDT, USDC, PAX and BUSD are all issued on Ethereum, although USDT also uses other blockchains such as Tron and Omni. Source: CoinDesk Research

The March 12 date is significant because that “Black Thursday” was a volatile day for cryptocurrency markets. Massive selling and derivatives liquidations totaling over $700 million on BitMEX sent prices downward, with ether going below $100 for the first time since 2018.

But this month the cryptocurrency market has been witnessing lower levels of spot trading volume and a dip in volatility after a see-saw March. So why are there more stablecoin assets being issued in this low volume, low-volatility environment?

“I think offshore and non-U.S. participation in getting access to [the U.S. dollar] through stablecoins is the culprit,” said Neil Van Huis, director of sales and institutional trading at digital asset financial services firm Blockfills. Van Huis also referenced the rise of other stablecoins, which compete with tether available on USD exchanges, also fueling growth. USDC, for example, is a joint venture between U.S. crypto companies Circle and Coinbase.

“Stablecoins, outside of tether, have become much more accessible globally,” Van Huis added.

As the world’s largest stablecoin, tether is mostly traded on exchanges that don’t have USD available. “Possible reasons for demand for stablecoin issuance might include users wishing to buy other digital assets and using stablecoins as a low-friction on-ramp as we believe they always have. In any event, we are gratified by the recent market demand for USDT,” said Stuart Hoegner, general counsel at Bitfinex, which controls the tether stablecoin.

So, what’s with the price rise of ether? Daniel Kim, head of business development for exchange aggregator SFOX, says the promise of decentralized finance (DeFi) is tending towards increased investment in ether. DeFi’s promise requires stablecoins to proliferate on the Ethereum network, and issuance increases are a bullish sign. “With market uncertainty, investors are looking for a safe yield investment, which stablecoins are providing.” Kim said.

Even so, not everyone can agree on the prospects of Ethereum as a network translating into long-term ether gains, despite today’s price appreciation. “There’s a marginal contribution, but nothing that is defensible from the perspective of making ether a proxy for profiting from increased stablecoin issuance,” said Vishal Shah, a crypto options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.

However, in the short term, SFOX’s Kim also noted both the wire transfer issues Finastra had when crypto markets crashed in March and coronavirus uncertainty as signals for some to invest in DeFi networks like Ethereum’s ether.

“With the most recent issue with Finastra and with what’s going on with COVID-19, investors are less confident of our banking system in moving funds when needed,” Kim noted. Indeed, value transfer on the Ethereum network is now surpassing that of Bitcoin, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency network.

The number stood at $196 million nine days ago. That was the highest since March 7, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

“The growth in open interest from CME may indicate that entities from traditional finance are more open to add bitcoin exposure to their portfolios, whilst retail investors are seemingly more reluctant to indulge in the futures market,” cryptocurrency platform Luno noted in its latest weekly market report.

An increase in open interest along with an increase in price is said to confirm an upward trend. Put simply, bitcoin’s recent rally has legs.

Bitcoin futures listed on the CME are widely considered to be synonymous with the institutional activity and macro traders. The CME is the largest futures exchange in the world, providing institutions access to derivatives on equities, commodities, foreign exchange pairs and bonds, and was one of the first exchanges to launch bitcoin futures in December 2017.

Open interest had dropped sharply from $316 million to $107 million during the three weeks to March 12, as institutions treated bitcoin as a source of liquidity during the coronavirus-led “Black Thursday” crash in the global equity markets. Investors generally prefer to hold cash, mainly U.S. dollars, during a crisis situation.

The financial markets have stabilized somewhat over the last couple of weeks, mainly due to the unprecedented monetary and fiscal lifelines launched by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government. The S&P 500 is currently reporting a rise of more than 25 percent from the multi-year low of 2,192 registered on March 24.

Rising interest, rising price

Bitcoin has seen a solid price rally over the past four weeks. The cryptocurrency is trading near $7,050 at press time, representing an 82 percent increase on the low of $3,867 reached on March 12, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

The price rise is accompanied by an uptick in open interest in futures listed on the CME, as noted earlier. Total open interest on other major exchanges including Bakkt, Kraken, ByBit, Huobi, BitMEX, OKEx, Deribit, Binance, FTX and Bitfinex also increased, from $1.7 billion on March 13 to $2.3 billion on March 15.

An increase in open interest along with an increase in price is said to confirm an upward trend. Put simply, bitcoin’s recent rally has legs.

The rally is said to be driven by short covering, or bears taking profits, when the price increase is accompanied by a drop in open interest, and it is often short-lived.

Futures trading volume drops

Some observers, especially chart analysts, look at the trading volumes to confirm price trends. Trading volume refers to the number of contracts traded during a given period of time.

A rise in volume along with a rise in price is said to validate the uptrend. However, in bitcoin’s case trading volumes are on a declining trend, as seen below.

Aggregate daily volume Source: skew

Total daily trading volume in futures listed across the globe topped out above $45 billion in mid-March and stood below $10 billion on Wednesday. Meanwhile, daily volume fell to a 4.5-month low of $83 million in CME’s futures, according to Skew data.

Hence, chart analysts may put a question mark on the sustainability of the recent price rally.

However, futures trading volume has dropped amid a rise in open interest. “It is often the result of investors holding on to their positions,” said Emmanuel Goh, CEO of Skew, in a Telegram chat in February, when the futures market was facing a similar situation.","The U.S. state of Wyoming has amended its insurance code to allow domestic insurance companies to invest in “digital assets” such as bitcoin.

The amendment was passed last month and comes into effect on July 1, according to information from the Wyoming State Legislature, the legislative branch of the state.

The new law states that an insurer may invest in “digital assets, as defined by W.S. 34‑29‑101(a)(i) and excluding digital consumer assets as defined by W.S. 34-29-101(a)(ii).”

Wyoming law defines digital assets as “a representation of economic, proprietary or access rights that is stored in a computer readable format, and includes digital consumer assets, digital securities and virtual currency,” which includes cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Specifically, virtual currency is defined as a “digital asset that is: (A) Used as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value; and (B) Not recognized as legal tender by the United States government.”

As per the new law, insurance companies are now allowed to invest in “digital consumer assets.” These are defined as “digital asset that is used or bought primarily for consumptive, personal or household purposes.""



'The first provision of its kind'

U.S.-based law firm Kramer Levin said the amendment is “apparently the first provision of its kind in the nation.” However, whether insurance companies take advantage of this law remains to be seen, it added.



This is because “insurance companies are traditionally conservative with their investment portfolios (with portfolios typically invested mainly in high-grade bonds and mortgages),” said Kramer Levin.

“However, insurers may perceive — particularly in volatile financial markets — benefits such as noncorrelation to macroeconomic risks. The new law does not address issues such as valuation, accounting treatment or liquidity risk,” the law firm added.

Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Wyoming-based upcoming crypto bank Avanti, said: “Most likely insurers will offer this as part of variable life policies rather than whole life, since NAIC [National Association of Insurance Commissioners] capital charge will be high.”

Wyoming remains one of the most crypto and blockchain-friendly states. In the last two years, Wyoming has passed a series of laws, including recognizing cryptocurrency as money and allowing favorable tax treatment of cryptocurrency, among other measures."
2020-04-17,"Activity in the bitcoin options market picked up pace on Thursday, as bitcoin’s price jumped above $7,000 and opened the doors for stronger gains ahead of the next month’s reward halving.

Daily trading volume in bitcoin options listed on major exchanges – Deribit, LedgerX, Bakkt, OKEx, and CME – rose to $86.4 million on Thursday, the highest since March 16, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.

Netherland-based Deribit, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by options volume, contributed more than 85 percent of the total daily trading volume. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is synonymous with institutional activity, traded $832,000 worth of options contracts, a meager 1 percent of the global volume.

Aggregate open interest or number of outstanding option contracts also ticked higher to $642.3 million on Thursday, having bottomed out below $400 million in March.

Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price printed a high of $7,200 and closed Thursday with a 4.5 percent gain, its biggest single-day rise since April 6, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Importantly, the top cryptocurrency by the market value found acceptance above key average resistance at $7,000.

The breakout has revived the stalled uptrend from March lows and could fuel a rise toward $8,000 in the days leading up to the May 2020 halving. The event will reduce rewards per block mined on bitcoin’s blockchain by 50 percent to 6.25 BTC.

Some observers expect the impending supply cut

to bode well for bitcoin’s price. “Next month’s halving should serve as a

catalyst for more bullish medium to long term price action,” said Lennard Neo,

head of research at Stack.

Options market activity, however, suggests investors are making bets (buying put options), possibly to hedge against a potential post-halving price drop or another March-like macro-driven crash in the crypto markets.

The increased demand for put options is reflected in the rise of the put-call open interest ratio to a seven-week high of 0.63, according to Skew data.

Further, one-month, three-month, and six-month

25-delta skews are reporting positive values at press time – a sign that puts

are claiming higher prices or drawing stronger demand than call

options.

A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Meanwhile, a call option represents the right to buy.

It remains to be seen if halving powers strong gains in bitcoin. Meanwhile, stocks look to have bottomed out on the back of the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented monetary stimulus. Bitcoin, therefore, could remain better bid in the days leading up to the event.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $7,100, representing little change on the day. It is, however, up more than 80 percent from the low of $3,867 registered on March 13.

Meanwhile. traditional markets are reporting an improved risk appetite. Futures tied to the S&P 500 are up over 2 percent alongside impressive gains in the European equities.

Risk assets picked up a bid in Asia after media outlets reported that the University of Chicago Medicine researchers are seeing “rapid recoveries” in 125 coronavirus patients taking remdesivir – an experimental drug from US-based Gilead Sciences.

With stocks reporting solid gains, bitcoin could extend Thursday’s gain by rising toward recent highs above $7,400.","In brief:

Stablecoin market capitalization has reached a whopping $8 Billion.

This value stored in stablecoins has zapped away some market capitalization from Bitcoin (BTC).

With central banks minting fiat, stablecoins are backed by currencies prone to inflation.

An ideal future is where all trading is denominated in Satoshis.

Recent news has highlighted that the crypto market cap of stablecoins has reached a whopping $8 Billion further providing fuel to the question of whether such tokens/coins are harmful to the long term value of Bitcoin. Tether (USDT) alone, has a market cap of $6 Billion and stablecoins have become the favorite assets for traders who wish to wait out market volatility by storing value in them. Additionally, some stablecoins, such as the Tron version of Tether (USDT), are fast to the point where some traders prefer to use them to transfer funds between exchanges.

$8 Billion in Market Cap Not in Bitcoin (BTC)

When we do the math using the hypothetical situation where stablecoins would disappear and BTC was the sole beneficiary, we find that Bitcoin’s market cap would increase to around $138 Billion using the current value of $129.9 Billion. Further doing the math, this additional value would increase the price of Bitcoin to $7,528. This means that stablecoins have zapped away Bitcoin’s value by $438 using BTC’s value of $7,091 at the time of writing this.

Still using this line of thought, popular Bitcoin and crypto analyst, Matti Greenspan, put forth the hypothetical situation where stablecoins would be regulated. In such a situation, the obvious beneficiary would be Bitcoin. His tweet can be found below.

More than $8 billion now being stored in so called stable coins. If those start to get regulated, where do you think that value will go? pic.twitter.com/sbgaTfoTK9 — Mati Greenspan (tweets ≠ financial advice) (@MatiGreenspan) April 16, 2020

Stablecoins are an Old Way of Thinking

Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies have proven to be prone to inflation. At the time of writing this, all global economies are cushioning themselves from the effects of a recession by printing more fiat. We had the earlier situation where the US Feds printed a whole $2 Trillion to stimulate the US economy. Additionally, there are rumors that the some House Democrats are considering a plan to pay each adult American $2,000 per month until the Coronavirus has been contained.

Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, voiced his concern over this proposal through a tweet that cautioned against such a monthly allowance. He stated that it would encourage unemployment and the continual printing of fiat. His tweet was as follows.

Wouldn’t this encourage more unemployment? They can’t stop, they will just print more money. As it goes, fewer people will be working. Prices will sky rocket. I don’t see how they will address the hyper-inflations side of the problem. Maybe worry about that later?

Therefore, and as the popular meme goes, the money printing machine will continue going Brrr.

An Ideal Future Where Trading is Denominated in Satoshis

One perfect scenario would be where all stablecoins are non-existent and cryptocurrencies are denominated in Satoshi units. All trading and crypto transactions will consequently be referred to using the base unit of Sats (0.00000001 BTC).

Conclusion

With new reports indicating that stablecoins currently have a combined market cap of $8 Billion, we begin to question whether their existence is harmful to the value of Bitcoin (BTC). When we do our math, we find that this $8 Billion has zapped away close to $500 off of Bitcoin’s current value at $7,090. The existence of stablecoins can be argued as taking a few steps back to the old way of thinking according to fiat. An ideal situation would be where every cryptocurrency and their corresponding trading activities would all be denominated in Satoshis.

Although BTC surged to as high as $7,400 recently, it failed to test a key resistance level at $7,700 and has been stagnant since. Often, when the Bitcoin price becomes stuck in a tight range for an extended period of time, it tends to see significant volatility in the near-term.

While the Bitcoin price could spike upwards in a strong, short squeeze given the negative funding rate of BTC futures, more technical factors point toward a bearish retest of lower support levels rather than an abrupt upsurge.

A funding rate is a term used on futures exchanges to describe a system that compensates short and long holders, balancing out the market. As an example, the current funding rate of Bitcoin on BitMEX hovers at 0.01%, meaning that traders who long BTC or are betting that the Bitcoin price will go up have to pay 0.01% of their position to short contract holders, as there are more individuals shorting BTC in the market.

Funding rate is one of many indicators alongside volume, open interest, relative strength index, horizontal resistance and support levels that traders utilize to predict the price trend of Bitcoin.

What to expect in the short-term

In the last 24 hours, the Bitcoin price increased from $6,450 to $7,150, by around 10%, yet it is still in the same range it has been since April 3. One possible explanation for the tight range of Bitcoin and its inability to cleanly break out or down to a certain direction is that there are not a lot of investors in the market actively trading Bitcoin.

Whales, or large individual investors, could be hunting for liquidity, causing BTC to range between $6,500 and $7,200 for a prolonged period of time. Oftentimes, when the Bitcoin price is caught in a tight range, eventually it sees a significant price movement in a short time frame. An indicator that predicts wild volatility in the market is open interest.

The term open interest in Bitcoin futures trading means the total number of shorts and longs open in the market. Before the Bitcoin price fell from $10,500 to $5,800 earlier this year, the open interest of BTC on BitMEX was hovering at $1.1 billion. As of April 17, open interest of BitMEX Bitcoin futures stands at $482 million.

With open interest fairly low and volume still stagnant, BTC may still see several more days of consolidation. In the short-term, traders like Michael Van de Poppe state that BTC could first test the $8,000 resistance level before breaking down, possibly to the $4,000–$5,000 range.

According to a fractal shared by a cryptocurrency technical analyst known as TraderKoz, the recent price trend of Bitcoin closely resembles its fall from $10,500 to $3,600 in February–March of 2020.

The analyst said that the price action of Bitcoin in the past week compared with late February looks strikingly similar, showing an identical top formation. “Getting flashbacks to when we topped out in mid February. This PA literally looks exactly the same to me,” he said.

It is possible that the Bitcoin price is demonstrating an identical trend to February because of its v-shape recovery since its drop to the $3,000 range. Whales like Joe007, who have realized more than $61 million in profit since September 2019, expressed concerns toward the dependence on high leverage to push up the price of Bitcoin:

“If you got all-in and don’t have any fiat funds, your ability to protect Bitcoin from a sudden crash is exactly this: zero. If you’ve built a leveraged long position against BTC collateral, you are not protecting Bitcoin from a tail risk. No. You ARE a tail risk.”

The abrupt v-shape recovery from a capitulation-like move down to the $3,000 range, the cautious stance of investors reflected by the rising demand for Tether (USDT), and the uncertainty around the coronavirus pandemic are the strongest arguments to support the prediction of a severe short-term correction.

At a technical level, former International Monetary Fund economist and hedge fund manager Mark Dow said that Bitcoin is a “textbook” short, as the dominant cryptocurrency faces massive overhead resistance. He said that “over on Behavioral Macro that Bitcoin on the chart is facing massive overhead resistance,” and that there is a “textbook opportunity to short” at the moment.

At higher time frames, the Bitcoin price also demonstrated a validated head and shoulders top, which remains as one of the more accurate top formations for cryptocurrencies. “Head and shoulder setups are one of the most reliable classical patterns especially on higher timeframes,” according to Bitazu Capital partner Mohit Sorout, who is leaning toward a short-term bearish retest of lower supports.

Stablecoin demand surges

As the Bitcoin price struggles to surge past key resistance levels, demand for stablecoins has increased noticeably in the past month. Tether, the most widely utilized stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, added more than $2 billion to its market capitalization to securely become a top-four cryptocurrency globally.

Stablecoins have seen such a large spike in usage that value transfer on Ethereum reached that of Bitcoin for the first time in history. Cryptocurrency researcher Ryan Watkins said on the matter:

“This is a story of the explosion of stablecoins in Q1 2020. Q1 2020 was stablecoins’ best quarter ever. Driven by a global flight to safety amidst the coronavirus pandemic, stablecoin issuance ballooned over $8 billion in the quarter. Stablecoins added nearly as much market cap in Q1 2020 as they did in all of 2019.”

The clear outflow of funds from cryptocurrencies to Tether and other major stablecoins indicate that investors are seeking safety in a volatile market due to serious macro risks as a result of the economic consequences caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Contrary to the strong upsurge of Bitcoin in recent weeks, data suggests that investors remain cautious in the short-term trend of crypto.

A bullish short-term case to $8K

Technically, if the Bitcoin price cleanly breaks out of $7,400, an area of resistance it failed to test in early April, then it opens up a potential rally to the $7,900 to $8,000 range. One cryptocurrency trader who operates with the alias “Rookie” said Bitcoin’s consolidation on top of a key trendline indicates that more upside is likely:

“I think we’ve broken this significant downtrend line dating back to February (pre-black swan). We’re consolidating right above the trend-line right now, so expecting more upside.”

Bitcoin consolidates at an important resistance level. Source: Rookie

For investors eyeing an upside breakout in the short-term, the consolidation of Bitcoin at $7,000 remains the strongest argument for a quick near-term upsurge. If $3,600 is considered as the local bottom and $10,500 is seen as a local top, a Fibonacci Retracement drawn in between the range places $7,973 as the 0.618 level. In a Fibonacci system, the 0.618 area indicates a 61.8% drop from recent highs, which is acknowledged as a pivotal trend reversal point in trading.

Based on the higher time frame Fibonacci Retracement of Bitcoin, there is a high probability that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $8,000 before moving to retest the $4,200–$5,300 range.

However, as long as the Bitcoin price is stuck in the wide $6,500–$7,400 range and consolidates below $7,000, arguments to support the likelihood of an extended rally at this time remain weak. With the abrupt recovery of BTC leaving it vulnerable to a large pullback, bears are likely to retain control over the market until a major breakout above $7,400 occurs.","Facebook Libra Redesigned: New System and Cryptocurrency to Comply With Regulations

Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project has undergone major changes. A number of key areas have been redesigned, including the payment system, the Libra cryptocurrency, and the addition of new single-currency stablecoins. The changes largely aim to comply with regulatory requirements.

Libra Project Redesigned, New Whitepaper

The Libra Association has published an updated whitepaper for the Libra project, originally announced by social media giant Facebook in June last year. Michael Engle, a developer at the Libra Association, explained some key changes in a blog post on Thursday.

Since the project was announced, “we’ve worked closely with regulators, central bankers, elected officials, and various stakeholders to shape an innovative approach to using blockchain technology to support a regulated, licensed payment system,” he shared, adding:

We have made changes to our initial approach, many of which depart from the approaches taken by other blockchain projects.

The new Libra whitepaper details that “Four key changes have been made to address regulatory concerns that deserve specific attention.”

The first is “Offering single-currency stablecoins in addition to the multi-currency coin.” The second concerns “Enhancing the safety of the Libra payment system with a robust compliance framework.” The other two areas are “Forgoing the future transition to a permissionless system while maintaining its key economic properties” and “Building strong protections into the design of the Libra Reserve.” Full details of the changes to the Libra project are outlined in the new whitepaper.

Single and Multi-Currency Stablecoins

Many regulators are worried that the planned Libra cryptocurrency could interfere with their countries’ national currencies and monetary policies if it achieves enough scale, such as being used by Facebook’s 2.5 billion users. To alleviate this concern, Engle explained:

We are augmenting the Libra network by including single-currency stablecoins (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP, etc.).

Instead of using existing stablecoins, such as tether (USDT), Libra’s single-country stablecoins are self-issued, and the Libra coin (LBR) will be separate from them. Initially, Libra’s stablecoins will be the currencies that make up the proposed LBR basket, such as the Librausd (USD), Libraeur (EUR), Libragbp (GBP), and Librasgd (SGD). “We hope to work with regulators, central banks, and financial institutions around the world to expand over time the number of single-currency stablecoins available on the Libra network,” the Libra Association wrote.

The new plan “will allow people and businesses in the regions whose local currencies have single-currency stablecoins on the Libra network to directly access a stablecoin in their currency,” the whitepaper adds. “Each single-currency stablecoin will be fully backed by the Reserve, which will consist of cash or cash equivalents and very short-term government securities denominated in that currency.”

The New Libra Coin

The design of the Libra coin has also been changed. The new whitepaper explains that the new Libra coin “will not be a separate digital asset from the single-currency stablecoins,” adding:

Under this change, LBR will simply be a digital composite of some of the single-currency stablecoins available on the Libra network.

“It will be defined in terms of fixed nominal weights, such as the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) maintained by the International Money Fund (IMF),” the whitepaper notes, adding that this approach provides “a clear path for seamlessly integrating central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as they become available.” Moreover, the Reserve “will hold assets with very short-term maturity, low credit risk, and high liquidity. It will also maintain a capital buffer.”

Licenses and New Launch Date

The Libra Association also announced on Thursday that it has initiated the formal payment system licensing process with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), Switzerland’s financial regulator. According to reports, the association also plans to register with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money service business.

In building the Libra system, the association has incorporated feedback from regulators. Amid regulatory scrutiny, some of Libra supporters have left the project, including Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Vodafone, and Shopify. Some supporters now also back a competing project, Celo. This week, the G20 discussed setting rules for the regulation of stablecoins like Libra.

The planned launch date for the Libra project was originally set for the end of June. However, Dante Disparte, Libra Association’s head of policy and communications, told the media that now the aim is to launch the project between mid-November and the end of the year.

(TSX:HUT) surged 32 percent with unusually high trading volume on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday.

The huge, surprising bounce for the stock arrives after the firm warned earlier in April that coronavirus-related issues might hurt its business.

Like cryptocurrencies themselves, mining company stocks are prone to violent swings, noted Moe Adham, CEO of Canada-based crypto BTM operator Bitaccess.

“These stocks are thinly traded. Happens all the time,” said Adham, who also sits on the board of publicly traded Cypherpunk Holdings (Canadian Stock Exchange: HODL).

However, volumes for Hut 8’s stock are over 1.5 million in shares traded Friday, nearly eight times the daily average.

The stock’s price did dip some in afternoon trading Eastern time, but the jump is still striking.

The advantage Hut 8 enjoys in Canada, where cryptocurrency mining is deemed “essential” during the coronavirus pandemic and thus exempt from a government lockdown, gives it an edge over competitors in other countries.

As the bitcoin halving looms, traders will be watching publicly traded crypto mining companies to better understand the profitability of generating BTC for cash flow.

Oil price decline no help to crypto miners

The drop in oil prices this year has been a huge topic for traders across all markets, including crypto.

On Jan. 2, the first day of trading for the year, oil changed hands for as high as $64 a barrel.

On Friday, the commodity traded in a narrow $18 range.

Oil was relatively steady until 2020. Source: CoinDesk Research

Oil prices are often seen as a bellwether for energy costs. However, it is a poor proxy for these costs when discussing bitcoin mining, which mostly utilizes green energy sources, said Simon Peters, a crypto analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro.

“The most recent report from CoinShares suggests 73 percent of the energy used for bitcoin mining comes from renewables rather than fossil fuels such as oil,” Peters said.

In addition, Hut 8 uses natural gas, notes CoinDesk Research’s Matt Yamamoto, who is working on a report about the company.

Hence, any reduction in energy prices due to oil’s decline will likely not help the crypto mining industry, Peters said. “If we did see all energy providers reduce their kilowatt hour rates, including renewables, then possibly less-efficient mining operations may still be able to hold their heads above water, post-block reward halving.”

Crypto markets

Bitcoin prices have climbed by less than 1 percent over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index as of 20:50 UTC (4:50 p.m. EDT) Friday.

Bitcoin is above the 50-day moving average on spot exchanges such as Coinbase but trading action has been fairly flat, with little up or down movement. For most of the day, bitcoin has ambled in a $7,000-7,200 range.

Digital assets are mixed on CoinDesk’s big board for the day. Ether (ETH) slipped less than a percent. Gainers include dogecoin (DOGE) gaining 2 percent, cardano (ADA) up 1.3 percent, and bitcoin gold (BTG) in the green 1.2 percent. One notable loser today is lisk (LSK), in the red 1 percent.

A sharp increase in stablecoin issuance is giving traders an easy place to park value on flat bitcoin days like Friday, according to Mitesh Shah, an analyst and founder of Omnia Markets, which studies the crypto market.

“As we have seen with the current economic climate created by the pandemic, many crypto investors liquidated BTC, ETH, LTC and XRP holdings and invested in stablecoins as a storage of value,” Shah said. Sitting in price-stable crypto may even set the stage for a bitcoin binge in the future when traders decide to not sit on the sidelines.

Indeed, in this uncertain environment access to the U.S. dollar (which many think of as the world’s reserve currency) in the form of a blockchain-based asset is highly attractive to global traders.

“Fiat currencies [other than the dollar] are getting impacted by the latest economic turmoil, which results in the fluctuation in exchange rates, reducing the purchasing power and inflation in the market,”said Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto fund BitBull Capital.

“Hypothetically, these issues can be overcome by the use of stablecoins,” he said.

Grayscale Investments has announced the strongest quarter in its history. Investments into the company’s cryptocurrency products, including the flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), hit a record high in the first quarter. Of the total investment, 88% comes from institutional investors. The company now has $2.2 billion in assets under management.

Also read: Bitcoin Revolution: Wanna Earn $1,000 a Day? Government Warns About This Scam

Strongest Quarter Yet

Grayscale Investments announced its quarterly results on Thursday as the worldwide economic crisis escalates. “Despite the risk asset drawdown this quarter, Grayscale’s assets under management (‘AUM’) continues towards all-time highs, as does our share of the digital asset market,” the company wrote, tweeting:

Q1 2020 marks Grayscale’s strongest quarter yet, with over $500 million raised … that’s 83% of total capital raised for all of 2019, in just one quarter.

Specifically, the total investment into Grayscale crypto products in Q1 2020 amounted to $503.7 million, compared to $1.07 billion for the trailing 12 months. At the end of March, the company’s total assets under management since inception (Sept. 25, 2013) totaled approximately $2.2 billion.

The company explained that Q1 2020 was the “largest quarterly [investment] raise in Grayscale history,” which nearly doubled the previous quarterly high of $254.8 million in 3Q 2019. “For the first time, inflows into Grayscale products over a 12-month period crossed the $1 billion threshold ($1.07 billion) … Cumulative investment across the Grayscale family of products since inception has reached $1.68 billion,” the company revealed, noting:

Majority of investment (88%) came from institutional investors, dominated by hedge funds.

Besides institutional investors, accredited individuals accounted for 5% of the total investment in the first quarter, followed by retirement accounts (4%) and family offices (3%).

Products Drawing the Most Investments

Grayscale offers 10 cryptocurrency investment products: Bitcoin Trust (BTC), Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH), Ethereum Trust (ETH), Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC), Horizen Trust (ZEN), Litecoin Trust (LTC), Stellar Lumens Trust (XLM), XRP Trust (XRP), Zcash Trust (ZEC), and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund.

These crypto products are private investment vehicles. Except for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, these products are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or any other regulators. However, some are publicly quoted on OTCQX under the Alternative Reporting Standards: GBTC, Ethereum Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust, and Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC).

In addition, following the record quarter, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust now holds approximately 1.7% of the entire circulating bitcoin supply, the company noted on Thursday, elaborating:

New investors accounted for $160.1 million in inflows. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust both experienced record quarterly inflows of $388.9 million and $110.0 million, respectively.

The billionaire crypto entrepreneur and early Bitcoin investor says the smart contract project is built with quality technology and supported by a following that’s reminiscent of the early BTC and Ethereum evangelists.

“I really appreciate the passion of the LINK Marines. Their fervor and dedication reminds me of the early Bitcoin and Ethereum communities. Unlike many other crypto armies, they are dedicated to a project that has real promise and technical merit.”

Gemini recently announced the addition of trading and custody services for LINK, as well as Dai and Orchid (OXT). Winklevoss says he doesn’t own any Chainlink but thinks it’s a “fantastic project that demonstrates one of the many great promises of crypto.”

Chainlink’s main goal is to give enterprises a simple and seamless way to take data and place it on the blockchain. The token is designed to reward people who run nodes and power the network.

LINK outperformed Bitcoin in 2019 and was one of the most successful crypto assets of the year, rising from around $0.29 last January to about $1.80 by the end of December, according to CoinMarketCap.

After reaching an all-time high of $4.95 on March 4th, it crashed in mid-March like the rest of the crypto industry. It has bounced back from its March low of $1.64 and is currently trading at $3.47 at the time of writing.

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Liu zishan","Shenzhen-based MicroBT is rolling out three top-of-the-line bitcoin miners amid heated competition with Bitmain ahead of the network’s halving event in less than 30 days.

Chen Jianbing, COO of MicroBT, announced in an online event on Friday that the three new models – the WhatsMiner M30S+, M30S++ and M31S+ – are available via both warehouse inventory and pre-orders that can be delivered in up to 30 days.

The move underscores MicroBT’s neck-and-neck competition in the multi-billion-dollar mining hardware market with major rival Bitmain, which is scheduled to deliver the first batch of its latest AntMiner S19 and S19 Pro miners in May.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

At the event, Chen reemphasized MicroBT’s rapid growth in 2019, having achieved sales of 600,000 units of its WhatsMiner M20 series, which, as CoinDesk reported in February, has chipped away at Bitmain’s longstanding market dominance.

The COO said 2019 sales volume had also doubled compared with 2018, boosting its sold computing power to 35 million terahashes per second (TH/s). That accounted for 35 percent of the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate as of the end of December.

The new models add to MicroBT’s existing M30 product line, which includes the previously launched WhatsMiner M30S and M31S.

Efficiency war

With the latest equipment from both major manufacturers soon to start shipping, the bitcoin mining hardware market is now entering what Chen called the “3X era,” referring to a mining efficiency that’s below 40 watts per terahash (W/T).

For context, W/T measures how much electricity a mining machine consumes for each terahash of computing power. Since bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive computing process, a miner with a lower W/T ratio would be able to bring home a higher gross margin.

This metric has become considerably more important given the upcoming bitcoin halving, which will reduce the amount of bitcoin earned by the mining industry in a day from around 1,800 to 900 units.

According to the firm’s specifications, the M30S+ is able to compute at a 100 TH/s with 34 W/T efficiency, while the M30S++ can compute as much as 112 TH/s at 31 W/T. The previously launched M30S is claimed to deliver an efficiency of 38 W/T.

Meanwhile, the M31S+ and the earlier M31S both deliver an efficiency of 42 W/T. However, Chen said the new model has the option to switch to a lower voltage mode in order to improve the efficiency to below 40 W/T.

To put this into perspective, by Bitmain’s specification, AntMiner S19 and S19 Pro machines are said to be able to compute at 95 TH/s and 110 TH/s with an efficiency of 34 W/T and 30 W/T, respectively.

Tough times

But arguably miner manufacturers are all facing a tough time selling equipment under current market conditions, with mining operations taking a step back to wait and see how bitcoin’s price will play out after halving.

Major manufacturers have had to mark down the prices of their mining equipment following bitcoin’s price crash on March 12, the largest sell-off since 2013.

Vincent Zhang, MicroBT’s head of sales, said during the launch event the WhatsMiner M30S is now priced at $1,962 – down from around $2,500 when it was initially released. For the new models announced today, the M30S+ and M30S++ are priced at $2,740 and $3,899 per unit, respectively.

Following the recent price cuts, manufacturers such as Bitmain have also had to partially refund customers who placed pre-orders at the higher price, a policy the firm has had in place for the past several years.

Zhang said MicroBT is now also enforcing such a policy in its bid to keep customers happy. Users who have placed pre-orders at a higher price than the retail value at the time of delivery will be compensated for the difference, like with Bitmain, in cash coupons. These can only be redeemed at up to 10 percent of the value of additional goods purchased by MicroBT.

Although MicroBT gained a large amount of market share in 2019, it had issues delivering devices on the timeline it had promised to customers, suffering up to several months of delays.

Zhang said the firm will now compensate customers in cash coupons worth 0.3 percent of the value of a pre-ordered machine for each day a delivery is delayed beyond the promised date."
2020-04-18,"Bitcoin is currently in the midst of a bullish market movement, as it is breaking through the $7,200 level. At the same time, a crypto analyst who correctly predicted Bitcoin’s downtrend during 2019 is now turning bullish. Specifically, he suggests Bitcoin is ready for a “boom and bust cycle” that could bring the premier crypto to $400,000.

Crypto analyst with impressive track-record turns bullish

This Bitcoin analyst and strategist is known in the crypto industry as “Dave the Wave”. Although anyone can make predictions regarding the Bitcoin price development, Dave the Wave’s statements carry significant weight.

Specifically, this is due to his correct prediction that Bitcoin would enter a “parabolic downtrend” last year. After Dave the Wave’s prediction in July last year, Bitcoin fell from $11,600 to $6,425 – in line with his predictions.

However, Dave the Wave is now turning bullish. In fact, he is updating his long-term Bitcoin forecast – and is dramatically increasing his price target. After plotting a curve of the Bitcoin price with regard to past price history, Dave the Wave has a number of predictions.

Dave the Wave predicts $400,000 Bitcoin price

Firstly, he believes Bitcoin’s volatility will continue to decrease in the coming decade. What’s more, he suggests that Bitcoin will embark on a dramatic “boom and bust cycle”.

According to Dave the Wave, this boom and bust cycle will bring the price of Bitcoin to $110,000 at the end of 2022. After this, however, Bitcoin will experience a crash that brings it to a low of $30,000 in 2025.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin will then begin a long-term recovery that will bring it to staggering heights. In fact, Dave the Wave predicts that Bitcoin will rally and reach a whopping $400,000 price in 2029.

Bitcoin could trade in $200K to $500K corridor

Dave the Wave’s price prediction chart is available in this tweet. Moreover, it suggests that Bitcoin could reach as high as $500,000 – and that it will trade in a channel between $200,000 and $500,000 around the end of the decade.

These numbers could seem fanciful to those new to the cryptocurrency industry. However, it would not be the first time Bitcoin rallies by a seemingly unthinkable amount. Furthermore, the fact that Dave the Wave has been correct in the past lends some credence to this prediction.

However, one should note that it is always hard to accurately predict something taking place far into the future. Although it would seem Dave the Wave’s model is plotting a general direction of Bitcoin’s future price, precise price predictions are extremely challenging.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways The $10 billion Medallion Fund has been given the nod to trade CME Bitcoin futures.

CME’s illiquidity may prove to be an impediment to efficient position sizing for Medallion.

There are several positive implications that arise as one of the world’s largest hedge funds publicly states they are ready to trade the asset class.

Share this article

Renaissance Technologies’ flagship Medallion fund has returned 24% year-to-date while most institutional funds have taken a beating. Dubbed the world’s greatest hedge fund, Medallion has received permission to trade Bitcoin futures over the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

Trading Bitcoin on the CME

Jim Simons, the founder of Renaissance Technologies, is considered one of the greatest traders of his time. Under Renaissance lies the Medallion Fund, which has earned investors a gross average return of 66.1% per year between 1988 and 2018.

For comparison, the S&P 500, a bellwether for the American economy, had a gross return of 11.66% over the same period. Simons’ fund counts $10 billion in assets under management at the time of press.

The Medallion fund listed Bitcoin futures as a potential trading vehicle on page 16 of a brochure filed with the SEC on Mar. 30. It will reportedly trade Bitcoin futures over the CME’s institutionalized platform.

In the filing, Medallion highlights Bitcoin’s risky investment profile, stating “investments of this type should be considered substantially more speculative and significantly more likely to result in a total loss of capital than many other investments.”

Beyond this, the firm also identified 11 other “associated risks” with regulatory uncertainty and the potential for fraud as the primary.

CME has been a relatively illiquid platform for trading Bitcoin since it’s launch in 2017. This is because most BTC volume tends to accrue on platforms like BitMEX and Binance that have more reasonable margin requirements.

Choosing CME could affect Medallion’s ability to efficiently trade Bitcoin, forcing them to take very small positions.

A 1% position size for Medallion, for instance, would make up 50% of CME’s Bitcoin futures open interest at the time of writing.

Medallion’s foray into Bitcoin is nonetheless huge news for the crypto industry. It indicates continued interest in BTC from large financial brands.

Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, a rival hedge fund, has already shown his disdain for Bitcoin.

Dalio stated that the genesis cryptocurrency is not a good alternative investment as it is neither a medium of exchange nor a reliable store of value.

Though the industry already has its own financial stalwarts in the form of Pantera Capital and others, the entrance of reputed players, like Dalio and Simons, could give Bitcoin’s reputation with legacy traders a major boost.","Get access to the FT's daily newsletter with guided explanation of and links to the day's top stories written by FT editors.

In addition to FT content, our editors select key stories from around the web that you shouldn't miss.","Renaissance Technologies, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, has been eyeing the bitcoin futures market, according to a regulatory form filed last month.

The $75 billion hedge fund, which is best known for pioneering quantitative-based investing, said in a March 30 dated Form ADV that its Medallion Funds are now ""permitted to enter into bitcoin futures transactions."" The firm said it would limit its trading activities to contracts traded on the CME. It's not clear if the firm has purchased any bitcoin futures at this point.

Launched in 2017, CME's bitcoin futures are cash-settled which allow investors to speculate on the burgeoning asset without having to take delivery of bitcoin itself. As The Block first reported earlier this week, CME Group saw an uptick in new accounts trading its bitcoin futures contracts during the first quarter of 2020. Still, the number of large traders and hedge funds using the product hit a low for 2020 in March, according to The Block's research.

Renaissance's ADV form, which offers investors information about its business practices, notes the risk of trading bitcoin and bitcoin-linked derivatives:

""The underlying commodity for these futures transactions, bitcoin, is a relatively new and highly speculative asset. Bitcoin and futures based on bitcoin are extremely volatile, and investment results may vary substantially over time. These instruments involve substantially more risk and potential for loss relative to more conventional financial instruments. Investments of this type should be considered substantially more speculative and significantly more likely to result in a total loss of capital than many other investments.""

On Friday, Renaissance's chief Medallion fund made headlines for its performance. The Wall Street Journal reported that the $10 billion fund gained 24% year-to-date as volatility gripped global markets. The Long Island-based firm rose 9.9% in March.

As noted by The Journal, the firm can hold thousands of stocks at any given time. At the same time, it also bets against thousands of shares of equities, currencies, and commodities.

Founded in 1982, the firm is led by award-winning mathematician James Simons. As noted by Bloomberg, the hedge fund's Medallion funds for are known for their high returns, returning to investors an average annual return of 40% from 1988 to 2018.","Cryptocurrency firm Purse.io, which allowed users to purchase items via Amazon at reduced or special rates using Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), is reportedly planning to close down its operations.

The San Francisco-based company confirmed on April 16, 2020 that it will shut down operations on June 26 of this year.

Until then, the company said it would be offering support for its existing orders and pending withdrawals.

Eduardo Gomez, support manager at Purse, said that the uncertainty of the crypto and the larger financial markets made it quite challenging for the company to maintain its operations.

Established in 2014, Purse has received investments from the Digital Currency Group and Roger Ver, an early crypto adopter who had made strategic investments in several crypto-related projects. Ver had referred to Purse as Bitcoin’s “killer app.”

At present, it remains unclear what the team members of Purse are planning to do, as some have said they are simply taking time off or even retiring. However, no concrete future plans have been announced yet.

The Purse.io team noted via Twitter:

“We’ve made the very difficult decision to dissolve the company. We’re grateful for the opportunity afforded by our supporters to build products and services for the cryptocurrency community.”

The team added:","The Cryptoverse brought us quite a few interesting stories this week. Lower USD interest rates, combined with the inflation and crypto volatility could bring greater demand for stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, and while Silk Road founder predicts that there will soon be another market crash before the BTC price goes up, Pantera Capital CEO thinks BTC will explode this year. Interestingly, 'bitcoin halving' became more popular on Google than 'bitcoin,' and locked-down Russian internet users flock to bitcoin (BTC) and the Bible . People tell the Cryptoverse what to do to get mass adoption, CZ says blockchain fundraising will continue to grow, and NEO's founder says blockchain is a post-pandemic winner. BTCPay integrated P2EP, and Rocket issues the first ever loan with ENS name as collateral. Meanwhile, investors sued the Maker Foundation.

Into the world of regulators we go! We may have seen first pics of China’s much-awaited CBDC, but digital yuan real-world tests may begin in May, and a number of tech giants became members of China's new blockchain committee, while IT firms quickly started denying involvement with digital currency. IMF said we’re in for a crisis like no other, and the Chair of the FSB said that ”global stablecoins” oversight recommendations are based on the 'same activity, same regulation' principle. Meanwhile, South Korea tells blockchain firms to seize the chance to become leaders, while the country's prosecutors are trying to open 15 seized crypto wallets in the Telegram Nth case. As an EU committee called for crypto regulations to be made on an international level, Zimbabwe may have (not) made a U-turn on BTC, and we learned that the government policies stand behind Venezuelan BTC exchange's SMS gateway service. Lastly, Facebook's Libra has a new plan to please regulators, Huobi Korea searches for new investors as it aims at the 'big three,' a crypto entrepreneur sold his personal tokens on the ETH blockchain, raising over USD 20,000, and blockchain-powered cosplay came to Japan.

And now, the jokes! Enjoy!

And for the end, let's see how positive affirmations classes teach us to use arrows to tell the future.","A chart published by Brian Armstrong, CEO of United States crypto exchange, Coinbase, suggests that a small portion of the American population may be using their coronavirus stimulus checks to purchase cryptocurrency.

A tweet, published by Armstrong on April 17, shows that the percentage of deposits and buys worth $1,200 — the exact value of the stimulus check — recently increased over four times. While the tweet does not explicitly state so, Armstrong’s position at Coinbase may suggest that this is the exchange where the data comes from.

Percentage of buys and deposits worth $1,200 each day. Source: Twitter

Coinbase did not answer Cointelegraph's request for more information by press time.

Financial aid for a pandemic-struck economy

The upsurge in the amount of $1,200 deposits and buys coincides with when residents began receiving stimulus checks, making the stimulus appear to be the most likely source of those funds.

The stimulus checks are meant to ease the economic hardship suffered by many U.S. residents who lost their jobs or are seeing much lower income amid the pandemic.

Many production activities, especially customer-facing social activities such as restaurants or cinemas, closed worldwide to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. These closures have left many without a source of income.

As the Washington Post recently reported, even low-income Americans who do not file tax returns have the right to receive the package. Parents are entitled to an additional $500 per child.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the demand for the stimulus checks is so great that the servers of some banks were unable to manage the request and failed to work properly. About 80 million U.S. residents have access to aid.

Wayne Chen — CEO of Interlapse and founder of virtual currency platform Coincurve — recently told Cointelegraph that the stimulus package may push the Bitcoin (BTC) market upwards.","Bitcoin has had a rough week, down around 9 percent and trading below $6,700. Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, believes we’re in a bear market that could even take the price under $3,200. Ulbricht is serving two life sentences for money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. Mike Novogratz disagrees. The famed investor and CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., is seeing greater adoption of Bitcoin, including among hedge funds and high-net worth individuals. He’s shorting stocks but believes “this is the time for Bitcoin.”

It’s certainly time for debt. The US national debt has now broken through $24 trillion as the Fed continues to print money to pay for the shutdown. That led Robert Kiyosaki to stand with Novogratz. The author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad thinks that all that free money makes Bitcoin a better buy than fiat. Meanwhile, Bitcoin comes closer to its halving.

All isn’t quiet in the cryptoworld though. Dan Hensley, a major stakeholder in Steem, has accused Justin Sun of bribing his way to the top of the platform. Hensley says that when Sun saw that he was losing a voting war, he started promising people $2,500 a month to run a witness node. He offered “money, power, and users,” says Hensley. The FBI is warning that crypto holders are at risk of coronavirus-related scams. Scammers are soliciting for fake donations and even threatening to infect computers with the virus. And a US court has ordered Craig Wright to provide documents proving that he has access to over a million Bitcoins. Wright, who has claimed to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, needs to provide 11,000 documents to show that he can access 1.1 million Bitcoins mined with his late partner Dave Kleiman. Wright has previously been accused of perjury and forging documents. And on the darknet, hackers, trolls, and other basement dwellers are selling and giving away half a million hacked Zoom accounts. Zoom’s vulnerabilities have led some to suggest that blockchain technology might offer a secure solution.

Governments are showing more interest in the blockchain. China has a plan to drive global blockchain adoption—and build the infrastructure network that enables it. And a number of US government agencies have warned that North Korea is now hacking cryptocurrency exchanges.

In better news, Taiwan tech firm HTC has confirmed that its Exodus blockchain phone will let users mine cryptocurrency. They’ll make $0.0038 a day on average. With a version of the phone available for around $244, users will be able to pay off the cost of their devices in about 176 years. If HTC needs help with that math, the blockchain is ready to lend a hand with that too. The rise of distance learning is leading to a take-up in blockchain-based education certificates.

And finally, John McAfee has sage advice for us all. He doesn’t know what will happen with fiat or crypto. So he recommends buying peanut butter. You can’t go wrong with that.",

But as an investment mantra it bears some scrutiny, especially in light of what it says about bitcoin.

When a multi-asset manager such as Ray Dalio uses that phrase, as he did in Davos earlier this year, we can assume he means cash is not as attractive for portfolios as other assets. He expanded further on this in a question-and-answer session on Reddit earlier this month, pointing out its “costly negative return.”

This warrants further clarification, as the actual yield on cash is a complex subject. The cash under your mattress does not earn any interest and has a theoretical storage cost. (Even if there’s no direct outlay, there’s the cost of a lack of solid rest due to bumpy sleep surfaces.) And there’s the opportunity cost – just think of all the potential returns you’re forgoing by not investing in stocks or bonds (oh wait…).

The cash in your bank account is also unlikely to produce meaningful income. And we now have the very real possibility that banks will start to apply negative rates to cash holdings, as part of a mandated strategy to stimulate spending.

(Note that I’m not saying I agree with this rationale, just that it’s often trotted out. There’s an opportunity cost to not having cash around as well. And many renowned investors are flush with cash, preferring to have “dry powder” for when opportunities arise.)

A bigger-picture way to look at cash returns is the real yield, which incorporates inflation. We are already seeing a dip in inflation as spending plummets due to lockdowns, but once economies re-open and the stimulus checks are used to purchase everyday items made relatively scarce by supply chain constraints, inflation is likely to edge or even surge upwards.

This will push real yields on cash well into negative territory. Then, cash will indeed be “trash.” But at least its negative territory will be stable.

Let’s look at the yield outlook for government bonds. Even before the Federal Reserve abruptly cut its benchmark rate to 0 percent last month, U.S. bond yields were heading down across all maturities. Other government debt either carries a negative return or default and currency risk.

Corporate bonds offer higher yields, but a wave of defaults is more likely now than at any time in recent history. They don’t call it a risk premium for nothing.

Stock yields, which have recently been even higher than bonds, are likely to head sharply down as dividends are cut across the board.

Two assets that aren’t looking at lower yields? Gold and bitcoin.

Both are “real assets” in that they don’t have any income. Which means there’s no income to cut. Their value may go down as well as up but it will do so because of consensus market forces, not political interference or centralized decisions.

This adds a new nuance to the use of the word “real.” Both gold and bitcoin can be influenced by political priorities and economic measures, but their intrinsic value cannot. And both gold and bitcoin are relatively liquid instruments with sophisticated derivatives markets.

True, both are held in multi-asset portfolios valued in fiat currencies, and both largely depend on fiat currencies for their utility, for now. But of the two, only bitcoin can operate efficiently outside the fiat rails. Only bitcoin can be exchanged for other assets without going through a fiat conversion.

For now, this feature is limited to crypto exchanges that let you buy other crypto assets with bitcoin. It’s a start, and as traditional and crypto capital markets gingerly approach each other it’s likely to spread.

Admittedly, that will take time; meanwhile, the point is this: Unlike cash and securities, bitcoin is not vulnerable to centralized decisions on asset yields, and it can be used in a way similar to cash in asset purchases. It is the only quasi-cash equivalent that is resilient to the likely politicization of finance that results from the current ructions in markets and the broader economy.

Cash may be dissed by some who believe that yields should be a fundamental investment consideration; but everything in the investment world is relative. We could see attention start to coalesce around a potential alternative – not to cash itself, but to the role it plays in asset allocations. Bitcoin is by no means a cash substitute, at least not yet. It will, however, become an increasingly intriguing alternative for some of cash’s applications.

Market metrics

Markets were all over the place this week, with bitcoin dropping 8 percent between Monday and Thursday, only to rebound by almost 9 percent by Friday.

The S&P 500 was also volatile, clocking in a second weekly gain in a row for the first time since February, in spite of yet another staggering jump in unemployment claims, the worst retail sales data since 1992, the worst New York state manufacturing data since WWII and a relentless climb in COVID-19 casualties. Maybe expectations are just so bad that the actual news comes as a relief. Or maybe reality doesn’t matter anymore. I don’t know.

Not to be left out, gold is also doing weird things, with the spread between the spot and futures price widening to its highest level in 40 years. The spot price reached its highest point in seven years, which is confusing given the strong performance of the main equity index. I really need to dig deeper into what the problem is, if any, with physical delivery.

Digital currencies

It was an intense week for significant (albeit unsurprising) developments in global stablecoins. The Facebook-backed Libra Project has pivoted from a multi-currency-backed global token to a wallet and blockchain for single currency stablecoins as well as a multi-currency stablecoin-backed stablecoin (not a typo).

The idea of a “digital dollar” to facilitate stimulus payments has been reintroduced in the latest stimulus bill.

And my colleagues Wolfie Zhao and David Pan went deep into the Chinese national blockchain platform with global ambitions that could significantly impact the digital currency plans of central banks around the world.

Our chief content officer, Michael Casey, has launched a newsletter focused on the impact of these and other developments on our financial system. It’s called “Money Reimagined,” and it comes out on Fridays – you can subscribe here, and read the latest issue here.

CHAIN LINKS

Renaissance Technologies’ flagship Medallion fund is considering adding cash-settled bitcoin futures to its holdings, according to a recent filing. TAKEAWAY: On the surface this may seem like a big deal: One of the world’s largest and best-known hedge funds (the Medallion fund has nearly $10 billion AUM and is up 24 percent so far this year) believes bitcoin is worthy of investment. But, digging a bit deeper, it’s not that at all. Renaissance is a quant firm, which means it does not pay attention to underlying stories. It cares about correlations. Bitcoin exposure does not mean the managers see bitcoin as a revolutionary idea worth betting on; it’s a number. Still, we should keep an eye on bitcoin futures volumes on the CME.

Silicon Valley venture firm Andreessen Horowitz is aiming to raise $450 million for a second cryptocurrency fund, according to the Financial Times. Its first crypto fund raised $350 million in 2018. TAKEAWAY: This is a pretty sizable vote of confidence in the sector’s potential, and not just through venture support for promising crypto-related companies. The investment may end up having an impact on the market itself – last year the firm registered all employees as financial advisers, enabling the fund to invest directly in crypto assets.

(You also might want to check out the company’s explanation of how crypto business models are different from web business models. TL;DR: It’s not just the network effect that gives value, it’s also the ability to reward participation and redistribute economic value to participants in the network, creating a virtuous circle of increasing participation and value.)

Researchers at the Kansas City Federal Reserve published a paper about bitcoin’s correlation with bonds and equities, with some unexpected results. TAKEAWAY: This study is particularly interesting in that it differs from studies that look at overall correlations over time. This one isolates times of financial stress, when you arguably most need a safe haven, and it finds that during these times bitcoin acts more like a risk asset and has positive (yes, positive) correlations with the S&P 500.

Marcel Burger gives us a good overview of the evolution and current state of the crypto derivatives market, and explains why settling in BTC while quoting in USD turns the P&L from linear to non-linear. TAKEAWAY: Yet another peculiarity of trading in the crypto market. Outside of the FX markets, most traders won’t be used to this risk shift. This could be one of the reasons that BitMEX’s liquidation engine gets so much exercise. (For more detail, see also our “Crypto Derivatives” report.)

TradeStation is now offering crypto trading via an agreement with institutional-grade crypto exchange ErisX. TAKEAWAY: This in itself isn’t really news – TradeStation has been offering crypto trading for almost a year now, through its subsidiary TradeStation Crypto. What is surprising is the legacy financial firm (founded in 1982) is continuing to invest in crypto market infrastructure, even after the disruptions of March. Just being offered on TradeStation is not enough to boost investor interest in crypto assets – many investors will still be wary of the volatility and relative lack of liquidity. But the additional exposure, getting in front of its sizable client base, won’t hurt. The platform is even promoting crypto asset trading on its home page.

According to analytics firm Glassnode, the amount of bitcoin held on exchanges is at its lowest level since June 2019. TAKEAWAY: This could imply investors are moving their holdings off-exchange into custody, a sign selling pressure might be easing. In theory, you hold your bitcoins on an exchange if you are likely to want to trade them. If you’re planning on holding them for a while, you’ll probably move them to a safer storage.

Grayscale Investments* released their Q1 figures, revealing over $500 million in new investment, with almost 90 percent coming from institutional investors. TAKEAWAY: The growth is impressive, but it is unclear how much of the increase comes from contributions in kind – a popular trade amongst professional investors is to exchange bitcoin for shares in the Bitcoin Trust and sell after the lockup period, pocketing the premium the trust traditionally commands in the market. The relative reliability of this return means that not all of the inflow growth is from institutional investors excited by the potential of the cryptocurrency market.

*Grayscale Investments is a wholly owned subsidiary of CoinDesk’s parent, DCG.

Greenidge Generation, an upstate New York power plant using proprietary facilities to mine bitcoin, has sold up to 30 percent of its computing power to institutional buyers. TAKEAWAY: This came out last week after I had finished the newsletter, but is worth flagging anyway because I am convinced we will see more traditional companies adapting their current installations to generate additional income through cryptocurrency mining. Keep an eye on other electricity generators and also on the oil and gas industry, where a lot of energy currently goes to waste and could be monetized through mining rigs. This would be very good news for the sector, as it would further decentralize the infrastructure and embed cryptocurrency in more mainstream business settings.

Shares of cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 Mining Corp. (HUT) rose 32 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday, on volume nearly eight times the daily average. TAKEAWAY: I don’t know what’s going on, but for perspective the shares are now back to where they were a month ago. The few listed shares with strong crypto exposure are worth keeping a close eye on not just as investment opportunities but also for what they teach us about sector economics. Mining companies are vulnerable to a sharp drop in revenue post-halving, but also stand to benefit from price upside.

Leah Callon-Butler describes how COVID-19 highlights a potential crypto-shaped lifeline for citizens of the Philippines, and how traditional finance organizations are getting involved. TAKEAWAY: For much of the world, the potential of bitcoin is not as an investment asset – it’s used as a payment method. This duality should produce some intriguing growth patterns over the coming years as both narratives move forward.

After the spike resulting from the mid-March crash, the volatility of the S&P 500 has stayed high, while that of bitcoin has fallen. TAKEAWAY: This is true of the 30-day volatility, but even so, bitcoin’s volatility is still higher than that of the S&P; longer term, the difference is even more apparent.

Open interest in bitcoin futures on the CME have rebounded since the March crash. TAKEAWAY: The levels are still low, and are not yet accompanied by noticeably higher trading volumes. They do, however, indicate a gentle recovery of investor confidence that the sharp volatility of mid-March is unlikely to return in the short term.

Google searches for “Bitcoin halving” are shooting up. TAKEAWAY: Not a surprise, but it is indicative of an uptick in mainstream interest in bitcoin and, since we’re still a few weeks away, is likely to trend much higher (going by what happened in the last halving in 2016).

Source: Google Trends","The CEO of blockchain database startup Messari says there’s a huge amount of crypto capital sitting on the sidelines, ready to move into Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and the greater altcoin markets.

Ryan Selkis cites new data that shows cryptocurrency exchanges are now holding over $3 billion in stablecoins on behalf of their customers.

He says these investors are in a strategic position to re-enter the speculative crypto market at a moment’s notice.

“There’s now $3 billion++ of stablecoins sitting on exchanges. If investors wanted to cash out of crypto completely, they would have withdrawn funds to banks. Instead, we’ve got more dry powder held in the crypto economy than ever before. In both real and market cap % terms.”

Stablecoins are digital currencies that are pegged to traditional assets like fiat. They’re designed to hold a steady value and offer crypto traders an easy way to escape the high volatility of the crypto markets.

Back in November, Binance Research published a report on the habits of 69 high-net-worth customers with crypto allocations ranging from $100,000 to $25 million.

The survey found that 96% of those investors are utilizing the stablecoin market, with Tether (USDT) ranking as the top stablecoin by a wide margin. ‏‏

“Despite its ongoing legal issue being considered one of the most significant risks for the industry, USD Tether (USDT) remained the most widely used stablecoin (40%), for reasons quoted such as greater liquidity and higher market capitalization than its peers.

While alternative options are also being used, stablecoins backed by exchanges, like USDC (Coinbase, Circle) and BUSD (Binance), seemed to spark more prominent interest from many respondents than other (than USDT) fiat-backed competitors.”

The Coronavirus crash of mid-March has resulted in a lot of crypto traders being cautious.

The dominance of stablecoins is proof that they are waiting for favorable crypto conditions to get back to trading.

Staking crypto on the various exchanges has provided an alternative to trading and/or storing value in stablecoins.

The Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto market crash of mid-March was one event that not too many traders believed would happen. The majority of Bitcoin enthusiasts believed that the hype surrounding the Bitcoin halving event would provide much-needed immunity for the crypto markets to survive a shake-out in the event of a possible stock market meltdown. However, the tense days of March proved that Bitcoin is highly correlated to the stock markets during times of turmoil.

$8 Billion Locked up in Stablecoins

As with all periods of unexpected volatility, traders and investors quickly hopped on stablecoins to safeguard the value of their holdings in the crypto markets. As a result, Tether (USDT) has continually risen on Coinmarketcap and is currently ranked 4th after BTC, Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. The stablecoin’s market cap currently stands at $6.4 Billion making up 80% of the total value stored in stablecoins. Tether’s dominance has slowly but surely risen due to the uncertainty brought about by the effects of COVID19 on the global economies.

Staking of TRX, KAVA and other Cryptos is Providing a Profitable Alternative

With the world firmly in the thick of a global recession, favorable trading conditions to go LONG in the crypto markets will probably take a while to present themselves. At the time of writing this, flattening the curve of infections is happening but a return to normalcy has been projected to take months and roll over into 2021 with some estimates pushing it to 2022.

Therefore, many savvy crypto investors have discovered that staking is an easier way of storing their crypto holdings while gradually increasing their bags.

Exchanges such as Binance, Bitfinex, KuCoin and Poloniex, have started offering staking services for coins and tokens already listed on their platforms.

Using Binance staking services as an example, we observe the following estimated annualized returns in the staked token/coin.

Tron (TRX): 7 – 8% pa

ATOM: 6 – 9% pa

Tezos (XTZ): 6 – 9% pa

Algorand (ALGO): 8 – 10% pa

ONE: 8- 10% pa

Fetch (FET): 8 – 12% pa

QTUM: 6 – 8% pa

TROY: 15 – 16% pa

The above list is just a brief one to give the reader a better understanding of the potential investment potential of staking.

Staking Might be a Better Alternative to Trading the Uncertainty

With the Bitcoin halving narrative of gains almost destroyed by the Coronavirus crash of March 2020, trading cryptocurrencies as they range and wick haphazardly in either direction might be one-way traders are losing trading capital through stop losses and the dreaded liquidations.

Staking, on the other hand, might be a better alternative to trading. User funds idly generate profits in a manner more attractive than holding value through stablecoins.

Vitalik Buterin Believes Staking on Phones is Promising

Additionally, in a recent tweet, the Co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, rubbished the idea of mining cryptocurrencies on smart-phones while at the same time identifying staking as a promising option. His tweet can be found below.

Mining on phones is a fool's game. Goes against everything we know about hardware economies of scale and more likely to trick users with false hope than help them. *Staking* on phones, OTOH, is IMO quite promising…https://t.co/VGgkoHIDsP — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 13, 2020

Summing it Up

Trading Bitcoin and alt-coins during periods of global economic uncertainty might be one way of losing trading capital. Alternatively, and with staking, investors can store the value of their trading capital in coins or tokens that will generate a handsome amount in annualized returns.

On Saturday, as the crypto markets turned green, Tether printed $120,000,000 new USDT.

Tether is designed as a bridge between fiat currency and cryptocurrencies. As a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, traders often use it to escape crypto market volatility.

Tether has been accused of minting USDT in an effort to manipulate the market and push prices higher, but the company says it simply creates new crypto assets when there’s a rise in demand.

Tether’s chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, calls the minting of $120,000,000 USDT an “inventory replenish” and says the new tokens will be used to meet future demand.

Market research by TokenAnalyst from December of last year shows that the issuance of new USDT is highly correlated with previous Bitcoin surges.

The company says BTC rallies 70% of the time when new USDT is minted.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Uniswap’s imBTC pool succumbed to a special exploit, draining the pool of $260,000 of liquidity. One day later, this exploit was recreated on LendfMe.

The exploit was a known attack vector that takes advantage of a known smart contract vulnerability.

dForce raised money from the likes of Multicoin Capital and Huobi five days ago, putting these investors under pressure.

LendfMe deployed Compound’s copyrighted code, without consent, which may have contributed to a security lapse.

dForce’s money market arm, LendfMe, was drained of $25 million in a known smart contract exploit. The incident comes less than a week after a $1.5 million raise.

Market Eviscerates LendfMe

DeFi is an emerging niche within crypto, making it difficult for projects to implement vulnerability free code. But these difficulties are dramatically more pronounced when a project doesn’t fully understand the code it has deployed.

Uniswap’s imBTC pool was completely drained yesterday, raising the suspicions of on-chain investigators. The attack was done using a known exploit of ERC-777 tokens.

Today, LendfMe was emptied after a trader on the protocol managed to deploy a similar attack and drain the pool.

The vulnerability exploited on LendfMe was highlighted by ConsenSys for DEXes such as Uniswap. With ERC-777 token pools, a malicious entity can make constant contract calls to withdraw funds from the liquidity pool’s smart contract.

As a result, withdrawals are done faster than the balance can be updated, allowing an entity to purchase tokens for a steep discount by causing an imbalance to the liquidity pool. This very exploit was used to drain funds from the infamous Ethereum DAO smart contract in 2016.

According to dForce founder Mindao Yang, the hackers have attempted to contact the company and they “intend to enter into discussions with them.”

Recent dForce Investors Take a Hit

Four months ago, Compound accused LendfMe of plagiarizing its copyrighted code. Moreover, these accusations are substantiated. Reportedly, LendfMe didn’t bother to remove evidence of Compound’s license from its codebase on GitHub.

Despite the controversy, the project raised $1.5 million in capital in a financing round led by Multicoin Capital, announced just this week.

The rationale for investment was that dForce could cement its place as a leading player in the Eastern DeFi ecosystem. DeFi, however, is meant to be borderless, and is not restricted by geographic boundaries.

Users in China are not barred from using Compound, which was already three times more liquid than LendfMe before this incident.

dForce does have an edge through access to better channels for direct marketing and user on-boarding in Asia. But once again, it is critical to remind people that users in Asia can already leverage existing DeFi infrastructure.

If a project doesn't have the expertise to develop it's own smart contracts, and instead steals and redeploys somebody else's copyrighted code, it's a sign that they don't have the capacity or intention to consider security. Hope developers & users learn from the @LendfMe hack. — ? Leshner (@rleshner) April 19, 2020

Compound doesn’t support ERC-777 tokens yet, and perhaps for good reason. LendfMe’s deployment of stolen code may have contributed to the project’s lack of comprehension regarding complex security issues, leading them to succumb to the recent exploit.

“This attack was my failure. While I did not execute it, I should have anticipated it and taken actions to prevent it. My heart goes out to everyone harmed, and I will do everything in my power to make this right. I sincerely apologize to our users, to our new investors, and to my team for letting them down,” said Yang.","A somewhat secretive but promising hedge fund has reportedly been approved to make investments in the Bitcoin (BTC) futures markets.

As noted in a document dated March 30, 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now permitted Renaissance Technologies’ Medallion Funds to offer products and services involving the Bitcoin futures market.

Renaissance will begin offering cash-settled BTC contracts from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, which is one of the two oldest Bitcoin futures providers. The CME Group began offering Bitcoin futures back in December 2017.

The SEC confirmed:

“The Medallion Funds are permitted to enter into Bitcoin futures transactions, which Renaissance will limit to cash-settled futures contracts traded on the CME.”

The value of Renaissance’s $10 billion cryptocurrency hedge fund reportedly increased by 24% year to date, even though the markets have experienced significant volatility due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

In statements shared with the Wall Street Journal on April 17, 2020, investors noted that March 2020 saw the Bitcoin price drop by over 50% in a single one day. However, they pointed out that the fund still managed to provide almost 10% returns.

Meanwhile, BTC futures markets have been recovering after experiencing significantly reduced participation in recent weeks.

CME’s Bitcoin futures recorded all-time highs in terms of the number of new or unique accounts in March 2020, as they registered a 161% annual growth rate.

Renaissance Technologies is one of the world’s biggest hedge funds. The fund is well-known for introducing quantitative-based investing.

At present, it remains unclear whether the company has acquired any Bitcoin futures.

Renaissance’s ADV form, which provides information to potential investors about the firm’s business operations, points out the risks associated with trading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency derivatives.

The form states:

“The underlying commodity for these futures transactions, Bitcoin, is a relatively new and highly speculative asset. Bitcoin and futures based on bitcoin are extremely volatile, and investment results may vary substantially over time. These instruments involve substantially more risk and potential for loss relative to more conventional financial instruments.”

It adds:

“Investments of this type should be considered substantially more speculative and significantly more likely to result in a total loss of capital than many other investments.”

Renaissance Technologies works with thousands of stocks. The firm regularly bets against shares of equities, commodities, and major currencies.

Established in 1982, the company is managed by mathematician James Simons.

Medallion’s funds have yielded an average annual return of 40% from 1988 to 2018.","In brief A popular subreddit for cryptocurrencies reaches 1 million subscribers.

It's launching a competition to celebrate.

r/Bitcoin still occupies the top spot for crypto.

The prime subreddit for cryptocurrency memes, guerrilla reporting and price speculation, r/CryptoCurrency, today surpassed 1 million subscribers, making it the 299th most popular subreddit on the 14-year-old social network site.

To celebrate the landmark occasion—a once-in-a-lifetime event, so long as its 1 million subscribers don’t abandon it—r/CryptoCurrency is giving away close to 1.5 million satoshis, or…$107. To be eligible for the grand prize, subscribers must leave by comment a base10 number between 0 and 65535.

The competition will run until the end of April 22, whereupon comments will be locked and the winner randomly selected by Bitcoin miners. Specifically, the moderators will take the hash of Bitcoin block number 627300, read the last four characters of that hash, and convert them back to a base10 number. The comment with the closest number will win the top price of around $73, with two runners-up taking home the rest.

The 1 million mark lags behind its sister subreddit, r/Bitcoin, which has 1.375 million readers and is the 204th most subscribed to subreddit on the site. But it’s twice as many as r/Ethereum’s 457,950 readers, and four times as many as r/Ripple, which trails behind with 212,000 readers. But r/Bitcoin had the head start: it was created 9 years ago, while r/CryptoCurrency was created 7 years ago.

Follow the money

To capture Reddit’s closest analog to institutional investors, the folk at r/wallstreetbets, who describe themselves as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” r/CryptoCurrency must attract 118,566 more subscribers.

r/CryptoCurrency must work even harder to reach the real big leagues: r/worldnews has 23.8 million subscribers, and r/gaming has 25.8 million. The top spot is occupied by r/announcements—which users are subscribed to upon opening up new accounts—with 55.7 million subscribers. But who said this was going to be easy?","Singapore’s tax authority will not take a cut of airdropped cryptocurrency so long as the recipient gets it for free, according to an income tax treatment guide published Friday.

The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore’s (IRAS) e-tax guide fills in the tax gaps for so-called “digital tokens,” a catch-all for three crypto types: payment tokens, used to by goods and services; utility tokens, which represent a right to goods and services; and security tokens, or digital securities. Each has a new definition and corresponding tax treatment from the IRAS.

Meant as a guide for consumers and businesses as well as issuers of initial coin offerings (ICO), the guide describes a fragmented approach for an industry still coming into form.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The tax guide also clarifies procedures for more obscure crypto events. For example, IRAS will not levy income taxes against airdropped payment tokens or those that come from a blockchain hard fork, which is a “windfall.” Like other payment tokens, nontraditionally delivered cryptos will nonetheless be taxable on transactions.

IRAS’ guide considers payment tokens such as bitcoin to be “intangible property” instead of legal tender. If a consumer pays in bitcoin he is engaging in “barter trade” for which the goods and services are taxed, not the payment token itself. The same goes for businesses that can value their goods’ tax burden against government-issued money metrics.

Where things get tricky is determining the tax burden of a good or service with a value natively represented in crypto. A contractor who agrees to do a job for three bitcoins, for example, has no surefire way to calculate his tax because the IRAS has no “methodology to value payment tokens.”

The IRAS therefore mandates that taxpayers self-determine a “reasonable and verifiable” exchange rate from widely available services such as Coinbase and Binance.

Utility token transactions, conversely, are “unlikely” to trigger a taxable event for the user, whose acquisition of them as a right to future services “will be treated as prepayment.” In fact, utility tokens’ use will actually be deductible under the guide.

Security tokens operate under the same loose tax laws Asia’s tax haven applies to other securities. Singapore levies no capital gains tax on securities of any kind and sparingly taxes dividends depending on the issuer, leaving security tokens taxable only when classified as a “revenue asset.”

Singapore’s investor-friendly tax scheme leaves security token ICO issuers with the entirety of their raised capital. Utility token ICO issuers are not so lucky. Their proceeds are effectively deferred revenue that is taxable as soon as they deliver the goods. Payment token ICO issuers need to pay right away, though the guide said such schemes are “uncommon.”"
2020-04-20,"Bitcoin market volatility has hit three-month lows – marking a price squeeze that could soon pave the way for a big move on either side.

The spread between bitcoin’s Bollinger bands – volatility indicators placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving price average – narrowed to $895 on Monday. That’s the lowest level since Jan. 6, when the spread was $636, according to Bitstamp data.

Bitcoin has spent a better part of the last two weeks trading the range of $6,450–$7,450, with the range further narrowing to $7,000–$7,300 since Thursday.

The tightening of Bollinger Bands is widely considered to be an advanced indicator of an impending big move.

“When it tightens, it is because we have been consistently trading in a narrower range for a prolonged period and we should see a breakout very soon,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote.

As can be seen, bitcoin’s price volatility has exploded following previous tight ranges in October 2019 and January 2020.

Other volatility indicators have also witnessed a sharp drop over the last few weeks. For example, the Bollinger bandwidth, which is calculated by dividing the gap between the bands by the 20-day moving average, is seen at 0.13 at press time, having risen from 0.11 to 0.90 (high volatility) in the first three weeks of March.

Historically, a reading below 0.10 has marked an end of price consolidation or low-volatility environment. So with the metric currently at 0.13, we might see bitcoin trade without clear directional bias for a few more days.

Meanwhile, the volatility situation in the bitcoin options market looks to have normalized, as one-month implied volatility is now hovering below its average level of 77 percent, according to data provided by crypto derivatives firm Skew.

Option traders typically buy options when volatility drops below the lifetime average and tend to sell when volatility reaches extreme highs.

One-month implied volatility – the option market’s view of how volatile the asset would be over a four-week period – spiked from 55 percent to 184 percent in the first half of March. That came as the coronavirus-led sell-off in the global equity markets translated into a liquidity crisis that saw investors sell everything from gold to bitcoin.

The cryptocurrency fell by nearly 40 percent on March 12 and hit a low of $3,867 on the following day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark index, crashed by 35 percent in the four weeks to March 24, pushing the volatility (VIX) index higher from 20 percent to 86 percent. As of Friday, the S&P was reporting over 25 percent gains from lows seen on March 24, while the VIX index was hovering around 41.

Bearish move ahead?

Uncertainty in both the stock and cryptocurrency markets has declined over the past couple of weeks, largely due to the Federal Reserve’s open-ended asset purchase program and the U.S. government’s massive fiscal stimulus worth trillions of dollars.

However, markets are not out of the woods yet because the number of coronavirus cases is still rising globally. The coronavirus death toll in the U.S. crossed 40,000 over the weekend with over 744,000 infections, raising doubts over the nation’s readiness to reopen its economy.

Further, oil prices crashed close to a two-decade low below $16 early Monday on concerns of high inventory buildup in the U.S. As a result, equity markets could come under pressure, pushing bitcoin lower.

Put simply, the low-volatility period could end with a downside move, more so as miner-led selling pressure for bitcoin is currently high, according to crypto asset analytics company Coin Metrics.

On the downside, major support is seen around $6,450, the lower end of the recent trading range.

Some observers may argue the cryptocurrency is set to undergo reward halving next month and the supply-cutting event could draw bids for the cryptocurrencies, yielding a big move on the higher side.

However, both bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV recently failed to rally on their respective halvings. Litecoin, too, crashed following its halving on Aug 5, 2019. As a result, bitcoin investors may not buy into the bullish halving narrative.

At press time, bitcoin is sidelined near $7,070 and the futures on the S&P 500 are reporting risk aversion with a 1.5 percent drop.

While a breakout above the 100-week average confirmed last week is painting a bullish picture, a sudden move lower cannot be ruled out, with the macro factors looking bearish, as noted above. Further, the weekly chart money flow index shows that selling pressure is currently stronger than buying pressure.

The bullish case would get a boost if prices rise above the recent high of $7,469, opening the doors to the 100-day average at $8,075.","Bitcoin (BTC) maintained $7,000 despite strong resistance on April 20 as oil crashed through fresh support levels towards $10.

Heading into what promises to be a choppy week for traditional markets, here are five things to watch for Bitcoin traders in the coming days.

BTC price resistance

Data from Coin360 and Cointelegraph Markets showed some rare calm for BTC/USD as the week began. The pair circled $7,190 at press time, having lingered inside a $300 corridor over the weekend.

Bitcoin has now maintained $7,000 support since April 16, while analysts continue to warn that year-to-date resistance and the 200-day moving average both present barriers to further growth.

BTC/USD began 2020 at $7,295, while the 200-day moving average currently sits at around $8,000.

“Breaking and flipping the yearly level and I assume we can continue towards $7,600,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicted on Monday.

“Rejecting at $7,200-7,250 and rolling over and my first targets are $6,600 and $6,800.”

Nonetheless, as last week ended, the cryptocurrency moved above the 50-day moving average, flipping previous resistance.

Oil plumbs multi-decade lows

In traditional markets, the picture remained highly varied. Previous omens of $10 oil appeared to be slowly coming true as WTI crude fell below $15.

The last time such prices were recorded was in 1999, while a $10 price tag was rarely seen on market closes even then — since 1987, a close of $10.82 formed the record low, according to data from Macrotrends.

As Cointelegraph reported, even United States President Donald Trump has appeared resigned to the idea of oil falling even as low as single digits per barrel.

“No one wants oil right now,” Bloomberg summarized while tracking the decline on Monday.

Stocks climb but no one’s employed

Paradoxically, stock markets continue to gain, despite millions of unemployed workers still appearing and the U.S. and other governments supporting them with helicopter money.

Commentator Holger Zschaepitz noted on Monday that a basket of stocks known as FANGMAN — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia — traded just 7% below its all-time highs as the week began.

Since its crash in March, Bitcoin has shown a continued correlation with the fortunes of major stock markets.

The increasingly bizarre contrast has formed the topic of intense scrutiny by Bitcoin supporters, however, with Max Keiser arguing that it represents the illicit transfer of wealth away from workers and companies to banks and the state.

Halving countdown

Bitcoin’s third seminal block reward halving is now just three weeks away. Set to reduce the amount paid to miners per block to 6.25 BTC, the event will harden Bitcoin as money overnight.

In an interview on Sunday, Saifedean Ammous, author of the popular book “The Bitcoin Standard” made a simple argument for the halving’s positive impact on the Bitcoin price.

Once the flow of new Bitcoins halves, he argued, demand could theoretically also halve and still keep BTC/USD at its current level.

PlanB, the analyst behind the celebrated stock-to-flow price model, meanwhile sticks by its latest forecast — by the end of 2020, Bitcoin should trade at around $30,000.

A healthy difficulty adjustment

On Tuesday, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment feature means it will become 8.5% more difficult to find new blocks. This is one of the rare larger upticks after difficulty — and interpreted as a bullish sign by some analysts — adjusted downwards following last month’s price crash.

As Cointelegraph often reports, difficulty plays a key role in ensuring Bitcoin remains hard money — price fluctuations do not result in coins being mined faster or slower, and the stock-to-flow ratio is thus preserved.","Hong Kong’s securities regulator has approved the jurisdiction’s first-ever bitcoin index fund designed for institutional investors.

Arrano Capital, the blockchain investment arm of asset management firm Venture Smart Asia, has now met the licensing requirements from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) allowing it to begin dealing in cryptocurrency, according to a report by Bloomberg on Sunday. Within the first 12 months, Arrano is hoping to surpass $100 million in total assets under management through a fund tracking bitcoin prices.

The fund marks the first of its kind to have passed regulatory approval on the basis that it solely targets institutional investors. To market to the general public, the fund would have to become an “authorized fund” under Hong Kong rules. Arrano getting the green light potentially paves the way for similar funds to begin filing for licenses in the blockchain-friendly region.

Avaneesh Acquilla, chief investment officer at Arrano Capital, said that while the firm had received approvals for a bitcoin fund, he expected opportunities for other products in the future.

“It shows there are clear guidelines for managers of cryptocurrency funds in Hong Kong,” Acquilla told CoinDesk. “While the process is lengthy and detailed as you would expect, we have shown that it is possible to meet these standards.”

“Our next steps are to launch this fund successfully and comply with all of the relevant regulations,” he said.

An index fund is a type of mutual fund that was first championed by business magnate Jack Bogle. This type of fund offers a portfolio developed to match or track the components of a financial market index such as the S&P 500. That differs from an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which is an investment fund operating on a stock exchange that provides a stake in assets such as bonds and stocks.","Cryptocurrency Markets Moved by Regulatory Actions, Federal Reserve Bank Paper Shows

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has published a paper showing how cryptocurrency markets are affected by crypto regulatory actions. The research also determines whether the authorities have some scope to make cryptocurrency regulation effective.

Influencing Cryptocurrency Markets and Prices

Last week, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas published a working paper entitled “Cryptocurrency Market Reactions to Regulatory News.” The 18-page report is an updated version of a paper by the same authors previously published by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). It is co-authored by Raphael Auer, principal economist at the BIS, and Stijn Claessens, the BIS’ Head of Financial Stability Policy and Deputy Head of the Monetary and Economic Department.

The paper explores the effects of regulatory actions on cryptocurrency markets. The researchers found that the markets respond “most strongly to news events regarding the legal status of cryptocurrencies.” News of general bans on crypto use, whether cryptos are securities, whether they will not be treated as a currency, or strict AML/CFT measures have strong adverse impacts. News indicating possible legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies or initial coin offerings (ICOs) “coincides with strong market gains.”

Some regulatory announcements, however, do not affect cryptocurrency markets. According to the study:

Authorities’ unspecific general warnings have no effect, nor does news regarding the likelihood of central bank digital currency (CBDC) issuance.

Research Suggests Room for Effective Regulation

For their paper, Auer and Claessens identified 151 regulatory news events, most of which were in China, India, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. They assessed the intraday impact of these events on the price of bitcoin as well as the prices of other cryptocurrencies and other aspects of the crypto markets.

“Overall, our analysis suggests that, at the current juncture, there is scope to apply regulations,” they believe. “It also indicates that regulation need not be bad news for the markets, with price responses notably signaling a clear preference for a defined legal status, albeit a light regulatory regime.” The researchers concluded:

At the current juncture, authorities around the globe do have some scope to make regulation effective.

Threatening emails or letters in which scammers claim to have access to your personal information or knowledge of your “dirty secrets” and demand payment in Bitcoin to prevent release of this information have been circulating for years.

The correspondence claims that the writer will both release your information and infect you and/or your family with coronavirus unless payment is sent to a Bitcoin wallet.","Nothing screams confidence in the U.S. economy more than swapping Federal Reserve-issued money for a digital hedge against the mainstream financial system.

The U.S. government issued more than 80 million stimulus checks, each for $1,200, last week. To be deposited directly into bank accounts, the payment is intended to give citizens affected by the coronavirus a few extra dollars to pay for essentials, things such as food and utility bills.

But it appears some proportion of Americans instead of spending their stimulus check at Walmart, Amazon or wherever, may have decided to swap their dollars for crypto.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted earlier on Friday his exchange had experienced a sudden spike in the number of buys and deposits worth $1,200. Up until mid-April, around 0.1 percent of total buys and deposits had been for $1,200, then it suddenly spiked nearly 0.4 percent this week, around the time many Americans started receiving their stimulus checks.

Of course, it’s impossible to say for certain if all these deposits were U.S. citizens looking for a new home for their government-issued money. The graph doesn’t specify what the split was between buys and deposits, so it’s possible some customers may have simply parked their money in the exchange. We can’t tell if these deposits even came from the U.S.

But despite a soaring unemployment rate, most in the U.S. are still working and still getting paid. Many who are financially secure may have decided to invest, rather than spend, their stimulus checks.

Investors aren’t just heading over to Coinbase with their stimulus money. Speaking to CoinDesk, a Binance US spokesperson confirmed they had also seen a spike in $1,200 deposits. “People do seem to have deposited exactly $1,200 into Binance US in the past couple of days,” the firm said.

Adding to the evidence, last Thursday was also the single largest day for USD deposits into Binance US for more than a month, the spokesperson added, but declined to go into the specifics of how many deposits that would be.

Crypto prices took a hit when COVID-19 outbreak fears peaked in March but they have since rebounded. With interest rates at record lows and other assets, like equities, reporting lackluster returns, some U.S. investors may see this is as an opportunity to try a new asset class.","The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved Bitnomial Exchange to operate as a designated contracts market (DCM), meaning the exchange can now offer bitcoin futures and options contracts.

The approval, granted Monday, brings a new player to the still-small world of bitcoin futures in the U.S.

To date, only CME, Cboe, Bakkt, ErisX and LedgerX offer bitcoin futures and options contracts, though Cboe ended its contract in early 2019 and ErisX sees little volume on its futures. Unlike CME, Bitnomial appears to be focusing strictly on physically-settled contracts, meaning customers receive the actual bitcoin when the contract expires, rather than the fiat equivalent.

The CFTC conducted an onsite technical evaluation of the exchange’s operations before granting the approval, according to an order issued Monday.

Bitnomial said it was the “first and only startup exchange” to receive approval to offer both margined and physically delivered bitcoin futures and options contracts in the U.S.

“The approval allows Bitnomial to tackle a confluence of generational shifts in financial markets: First, a new generation of customers are emerging as savvy with trading, technology and delivery. Second, innovative new unregulated derivatives are booming with daily volumes topping $45 [billion] but may be illegal for many U.S. traders,” it said in a press release.

The release also said Bitnomial hopes to find customers for what it termed “new growth areas,” claiming the existing legacy firms have had difficulty tapping this base.

Bitnomial is now setting up user acceptance testing, expected to begin on April 27, and has opened user signups.

In a statement, founder and CEO Luke Hoersten said the company will start with quarterly futures, micro futures and options. Contracts trade on 37 percent margin and will settle on-chain rather than book entry.

Jump Capital’s Peter Johnson said physically settled bitcoin futures contracts are “still largely inaccessible” to much of the U.S. market. Jump Capital backed Bitnomial, alongside Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent firm.

“[Bitnomial’s] products are also reliably tied to the underlying asset price via the option for physical delivery. We’re excited to be partners with a company that is committed to meeting the highest regulatory standards and increasing the accessibility of crypto derivatives to U.S. traders,” he said in a statement.","Authorities in Malaysia have arrested 14 Chinese citizens because of their alleged involvement in a Bitcoin-related scam, which reportedly targeted unsuspecting investors in their home country.

Dzulkhairi Mukhatar, the assistant commander in Malaysia, confirmed that the men were taken into police custody on April 18, 2020, after two months of extensive investigations and surveillance.

The suspects are between the ages of 20 and 30. Three of the men arrested are not carrying valid travel documents, the officer revealed.

The group had reportedly been impersonating rich investors and were going after people through widely-used Chinese messaging apps, including WeChat and QQ.

Assistant Commander Mukhatar said that the suspects had been giving fake testimonies to persuade the victims into investing into fraudulent Bitcoin (BTC) schemes.

The 14 Chinese men arrested are now facing charges under the country’s Penal Code for cheating, which might require that the alleged offenders spend time in jail. They could be serving up to ten years behind bars.

They might also get caned (physical punishment) and have to pay fines. The alleged offenders could be charged under the Immigration Act, which may require that they pay as much as $2,300 in fines, and spend up to 5 years in jail, and receive up to six strokes of whipping.

Officials are currently investigating exactly how much money has been lost due to the cryptocurrency scam and the number of victims that were affected or targeted.

In November of last year, police officials in Malaysia had reportedly taken four men and one woman into custody for allegedly drilling a hole in a concrete wall that was connecting two separate buildings, in order to steal several Bitcoin mining machines.

There were 85 machines in total, and were worth around $10,300 each. Officials said that the team was not interested in selling the mining equipment. They wanted to operate it themselves to earn profits from crypto mining.","Singapore’s tax authority, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), confirmed that it will not be collecting taxes on airdropped cryptocurrency, provided that the recipients get them for free.

As noted in an income tax treatment guide, released on April 17, 2020, the IRAS clarified that it classifies digital tokens into three main categories.

These include payment tokens, which are primarily used to pay for products and services; utility tokens, which may represent a right to use a particular set of goods and services; and security tokens, or digital securities, which may be subject to the same set of laws that are applicable to traditional securities.

The tax authority provided updated definitions and corresponding tax treatment for the major types of crypto tokens.

The tax guidance from IRAS serves as an official guide for local consumers and crypto-related firms. It’s also meant as a reference for initial coin offering (ICO), initial exchange offerings (IEOs), and security token offering (STO) issuers. The guide mainly describes a fragmented approach for a nascent cryptocurrency and blockchain sector.

The tax guide confirms that the IRAS will not impose income taxes against airdropped digital payment tokens or cryptocurrencies obtained from a blockchain hard fork (backwards incompatible upgrade of a digital currency platform).

In a manner that’s similar to digital payment tokens, non-traditionally delivered cryptos (like via airdrops) will still trigger taxable events on transactions, meaning when holders actually spend their tokens.

IRAS’ guide clarifies that payment tokens like Bitcoin are “intangible property,” and are not considered legal tender. If anyone pays for goods or services in BTC, then they are taking part in a “barter trade” for which items that are being sold will be taxed, and not the actual payment token.

At present, the IRAS has not developed a “methodology to value payment tokens.”

The agency said that it requires taxpayers to self-determine a “reasonable and verifiable” exchange rate that may be quoted by large digital asset exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase.

Transactions made with utility tokens are “unlikely” to trigger taxable events, the IRAS said. Instead, the use of utility tokens might be a deductible event under the current guidelines.

Security tokens will be subject to tax laws that are applied to traditional securities.

Notably, Singapore does not tax capital gains on securities. The country only requests small amounts of taxes on dividends, which may depend on the issuer.

Security tokens earnings and transactions are taxed only when they’re considered a “revenue asset.”"
2020-04-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin has fared better than stocks but worse than gold and U.S. Treasuries during the coronavirus pandemic, with investors ascribing its performance to speculative bets and bids to hedge against inflation linked to stimulus measures.

Enthusiasts have laid out numerous narratives for bitcoin as an investment proposition through its first 12 years - from a rebel technology set to upend the financial system to a groundbreaking payments network; from an uncorrelated asset to a hedge against inflation-inducing government policies.

Here are some charts that illustrate bitcoin’s price performance during the coronavirus pandemic - and offer some clues as to what is driving investor behaviour.

OUTPERFORMING STOCKS

Bitcoin has this year done better than both U.S. and world stocks, posting a loss of around 5% compared to respective drops of 13% and 16% for the S&P 500 and MSCI All-Country World Index.

Like equities and other riskier assets, bitcoin surged in the wake of unprecedented stimulus packages launched by governments and central banks in mid-March to mitigate the economic damage caused by the coronavirus.

The cryptocurrency has soared 80% since mid-March, partly because it offers the chance of quick returns as the stimulus measures wash into markets, investors and traders said.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have appealed to investors as “they can offer a potentially higher risk-reward scenario that they cannot find in other assets”, said Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency asset manager.

SAFE HAVEN? MORE AN INFLATION HEDGE, INVESTORS SAY

Enthusiasts say bitcoin is immune to the impact of geopolitical tensions or government policy because of its decentralised nature. Unlike central bank-issued money, miners competing to solve computer puzzles produce bitcoin.

With a supply capped at 21 million, the argument goes, its scarcity gives it an innate value and shields it from central banks moves or policies that stoke inflation.

But in 2020, bitcoin fared worse than traditional safe havens like gold, up 11%, and U.S. 10-year Treasuries, gains on which have climbed 14%. On March 12, when bitcoin crashed 40% to its worst single day since 2013, other so-called safe havens proved far more resilient.

“The idea that it is a safe haven in the manner that gold is - I don’t think recent moves bear that out,” said Sui Chung of CF Benchmarks, a crypto benchmark provider.

Bitcoin’s gains, some investors say, were driven in part by bets it can hedge any future inflation caused by government stimulus measures.

“It’s not just the U.S. story, but more or less every major government is doing that to a similar magnitude,” said Richard Galvin, of crypto fund Digital Asset Capital Management.

“You don’t have many options to hedge that risk.”

Graphic - Bitcoin as a safe haven? 2020 returns suggest not:

BETTING ON PRICE SWINGS

Bitcoin’s notorious volatility has hobbled its use as a means of payment and scared off large, long-term investors such as pension funds - but attracted hedge funds and high-frequency traders, who make money on short-term price moves.

While volatility has gripped markets of all stripes during the coronavirus crisis, bitcoin’s price moves have soared - a boon for speculative traders who seek to trade on spreads across multiple platforms, major crypto exchanges say.

“You have high-frequency trading firms that trade on the scent of the spread to make money,” said Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at the major Bitfinex exchange, adding that they are rarely concerned with narratives surrounding bitcoin.

“Whether it’s milk or potatoes or bitcoin, they would trade anything - so they really don’t care about the philosophical point of view.”

Graphic - Bitcoin volatility:

SOARING VOLUMES

As bitcoin volatility jumped, major cryptocurrency exchanges saw huge spikes in volume in mid-March. Many investors sold off bitcoin - like other assets - to raise cash for margin calls, analysts said.

Daily volumes at the world’s top exchanges jumped to $21.6 billion on March 13, their highest in seven months and among the highest on record, research firm CryptoCompare said. Trading of crypto derivatives such as bitcoin futures - often favoured by high-frequency traders - also climbed in March to its highest on record.

But what exactly does the halving mean, and why is it that crypto investors expect the event to be so shockingly bullish? We’re taking a look at past halving cycles and providing various scenarios as to the final outcome of the event coming in just 21 days.

What is a Halving and Why Impact Does it Have on Bitcoin Price?

Bitcoin is the first of its kind and kicked off the cryptocurrency craze that has now led to thousands upon thousands of altcoins and billions of dollars in market cap.

However, it wasn’t the first attempt at creating a digital form of cash. Instead, Satoshi Nakamoto took early concepts designed by other cypherpunks and solved the most critical issue plaguing these other pioneer projects: double-spending.

Related Reading | Bitcoin Mining Sell Pressure Waning, Supply Shock To Drive Massive Price Increase

The only way previously to prevent double-spending, was by having a third-party or central authority validating transactions. Bitcoin does this without the need for a central authority through a process called proof-of-work, or Bitcoin mining.

The process involves hi-tech machinery designed to squeeze out as much has hash power at as low cost as possible, using it to solve complex mathematical equations. The miner or mining pool to solve all equations unlocks a reward of 12.5 BTC currently.

In three weeks, that drops to just 6.25 BTC. There are 31 of these pre-coded halvings set to reduce the Bitcoin supply at regular intervals until the full supply is in circulation.

Each halving in the past has kicked off a monstrous bull run. The idea is that the BTC supply miners receive gets slashed in half, raising production costs immediately. Miners halt selling at a loss, and it throws off the delicate balance of supply and demand.

This fact has had crypto investors considering the event to be incredibly bullish. And each time in the past, Bitcoin price rose exponentially following the event.

Crypto Investor Sentiment At Extreme Lows, May Miss Out On Opportunity of a Lifetime

In just three weeks, this same event happens once again, but the once highly anticipated event thought to be incredibly bullish, has done little to cause prices to rise in advance of what is expected to be the most important factor in causing Bitcoin price to rise.

Sentiment is in the gutter following last month’s record-breaking collapse that took the price of the leading cryptocurrency by market cap to under $4,000 at the low. The coronavirus pandemic has caused investors to be too fearful to take a risk with the cryptocurrency market, even with Bitcoin’s halving so close.

If the bullish explosion that was once expected does play out, many of Bitcoin’s biggest supporters may miss out on the opportunity they spent the last four years waiting for.

And if it doesn’t, well, the recession may send Bitcoin into its first real bear market in the asset’s history.","The hacker that drained $25 million in cryptocurrency from decentralized finance protocol dForce over the weekend has sent back almost all the stolen assets.

According to data visible on the Ethereum blockchain, multiple transactions were initiated from 6:00 UTC on Tuesday from an address labelled “Lendf.Me Hack” to the admin address for the Lendf.Me project.

The transactions included some extremely large amounts, such as one for 57,992 ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain – an amount worth around $10 million at press time.

Additional transactions involved various U.S. dollar-linked stablecoins – such as USDT, BUSD, TUSD, DAI, USDC, HUSD and PAX – totaling nearly $10 million.

Further, a total of 581 units of WBTC, HBTC and imBTC – ethereum tokens that peg to bitcoin as an underlying collateral – have also been returned. The sum of these is worth around $4 million at bitcoin’s current price.

Curiously, the hacker did not return exactly the same balance of assets as were stolen, but returned some of the value in other types of tokens. All told, however, they handed back crypto assets worth roughly $24 million as of press time.

It’s unknown at this stage why the hacker didn’t simply return the assets that were stolen, or indeed why they were returned at all.

Lendf is one of two protocols supported by the dForce Foundation. It saw $25 million in cryptocurrencies exit its wallets over three hours on Sunday morning Asia time.","Weiss Ratings is impressed by the relatively new crypto asset Tezos (XTZ).

The ratings agency says the technology that powers Tezos outshines leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and XRP.

Tezos is a smart contract proof-of-stake blockchain designed to give people who hold the cryptocurrency a stake in the platform in terms of its development and governance. Stakeholders can help power the network and earn rewards in return.

Despite Bitcoin’s status as the leading crypto asset, it’s excluded from the firm’s list of top 10 coins by technology. Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market cap, is ranked fourth, but Weiss says it will likely rise in future rankings.

“We have already upgraded Ethereum’s Technology grade once. And further upgrades are very possible as #Ethereum 2.0 rolls out. This combined with its high adoption rating make Ethereum very attractive indeed.”

Weiss Ratings ranks more than 120 digital assets based on technology, adoption, risk and momentum to help investors identify cryptocurrencies that have the best odds for long-term success.

Weiss Ratings Top Crypto Assets by Technology

Tezos Cardano Cosmos Fantom Ethereum

As for the overall crypto rankings, which consider adoption, technology, market momentum and investment risk, Weiss has Bitcoin in the number one slot, followed by Ethereum. Next is the IoT and micropayments-focused asset IOTA which takes the number three slot, ahead of XRP.

Bitcoin Ethereum IOTA Ripple LiteCoin

As for the state of the crypto markets, the agency says the economic aftermath from the coronavirus pandemic may set up a future digital asset bull run. In the age of trillion-dollar stimulus packages, fiscal lifelines and pandemic printing, Bitcoin will soon undergo its halving event, reducing the amount of new BTC that will enter the market.

“US debt is not only its biggest in history — it’s rising faster than ever. And it’s being monetized.

So while the world engages in unprecedented levels of quantitative easing, Bitcoin is getting ready for its quantitative hardening.”

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Tithi Luadthong",These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,"On 4 March, the Supreme Court overturned a ban imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on cryptocurrency payments. The RBI circular, in April 2018, had banned bank payment systems from being used for cryptocurrency-related payments. However, several cryptocurrency exchanges continued to operate, focusing on trading between cryptocurrencies rather than fresh investment in cryptocurrency by Indian investors. In some cases, they continued to process rupee payments through peer-to-peer mechanisms.

CoinDCX, which claims to be India’s largest crypto exchange continued to operate even after the ban. The exchange told Mint that it has seen a sharp rise in users and trading volumes after the SC judgment. “We saw nearly a 10x spike in sign-ups, post the Supreme Court judgment. The BTC/INR (Bitcoin to Indian Rupees) trading pair has seen 78.36% growth in the past 50 days.,"" said Sumit Gupta, founder, CoinDCX who added that the exchange has acquired 50,000 users in less than 50 days.

""Two factors are driving up volumes. First, most volumes on crypto exchanges are trading volumes and some traders have come back to the market post the SC judgment. It is largely not fresh investor money pouring in yet. If the latter had happened the price of say bitcoin would've been far higher than it is. This is because fairly small fiat currency inflows change cryptocurrency price in a big way,"" said Ajeet Khurana, former head of the BACC (Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee of the IAMAI) and former CEO of Zebpay.

""Second, people are sitting at home and have time to trade on their computers. This helps cryptocurrency trading,"" he said.

Bitcoin, which is the dominant cryptocurrency, has soared in the recent market turmoil but has also seen a lot of volatility. Over two days ending 13 March, Bitcoin saw a roughly 50% crash, briefly trading below $4000. Cryptocurrency has recovered since then to trade at around $6800 at the time of writing this report. It is up around 30% over the past year in US dollar terms.

Crypto industry leaders in India are divided over whether some of the newfound interest in virtual currencies is driven by the aggressive monetary policies of central banks in response to the economic downturn caused by the covid-19 pandemic. “With massive money printing not only in India but globally, what it is doing is decreasing the purchasing power of rupee gradually. There is a very small percentage of people in India who are noticing this and are hedging their portfolios towards crypto,"" said Gupta.

Some crypto proponents have drawn a parallel between virtual currencies and gold which also acts as a hedge against inflation and rises when monetary policy is loose. However, Khurana took a more conservative stance. “I don't think bitcoin presently has the same safe haven advantages as gold because it is not as uncorrelated with equity as gold is. For that participation and money in the crypto market has to go up by several degrees,"" he said. Bitcoin has risen around 42% over the past one year in rupee terms, partly propelled by depreciation in the Indian currency.

Investors should also take note of the regulatory risks associated with virtual currencies. The Supreme Court has invalidated the RBI ban on cryptocurrency related payments but it has not ruled on the legality of cryptocurrency in India. A draft government bill in 2019 reportedly sought to criminalize mere possession of cryptocurrency in India. However, the bill was not introduced in Parliament. Apart from regulatory risks, investors should also keep in mind that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can lead to substantial losses

Topics","New research warns cryptocurrency users the Lightning Network can expose financial information of bitcoin payments thought to be anonymous.

A second financial layer, the Lightning Network, was proposed in 2016 to improve the speed, affordability and privacy of bitcoin payments. In an attempt to enhance anonymity, transactions are broadcast off the bitcoin blockchain and routed through encrypted communications.

But according to two academic papers published in March and April, relatively straightforward cyberattacks could unearth balances on the Lightning Network. Authors of the March paper also unraveled pathways and parties of hidden payments.

“The gap between the potential privacy properties of the Lightning Network and the actual ones is large. As it is designed right now, the Lightning Network opens the door for various attacks,” said Ania Piotrowska, a cryptography researcher at the University College London, which collaborated with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on the March study.

Nodes, building blocks of the Lightning Network, are software gateways that exchange bitcoin via payment channels. Both research teams, the other at the University of Luxembourg and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, conducted attacks on only public channels. According to a report in January from cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, 72.2 percent of Lightning Network channels are publicly announced, and 27.8 percent are kept private.

“As Lightning Network gains popularity, it is often touted as an alternative to bitcoin that is not only more scalable but also more private,” said Piotrowska, who also works at cryptocurrency privacy infrastructure startup Nym Technologies. “We felt that it was an interesting research question to study how private Lightning actually is.”

A raft of academic and corporate institutions have taken up Lightning Network development, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative to bitcoin satellite maker Blockstream, engineering group Lightning Labs and Square Crypto, the cryptocurrency unit of the publicly traded financial technology company Square.

In December, Bitfinex, a high-volume cryptocurrency exchange, opted to let customers trade bitcoin over the Lightning Network.

Three-pronged attack

The American and British researchers, a team of seven, carried out three attacks on the Lightning Network during the months of December, January and February. Two attacks targeted the Lightning Network’s test network and main network to determine balances.

By forwarding payments with fake hashes – unique cryptographic identifiers of transactions – to channels opened with 132 test network nodes and six of the 10 largest main network nodes, the first balance attack accessed the balances of 619 test network channels and 678 main network channels.

The counterfeit payment spamming was stopped when error messages went away, a sign that actual channel amounts had been matched.

At the start of the first balance attack, 4,585 test network channels and 1,293 main network channels were trialed from 3,035 test network nodes sharing 8,665 channels and 6,107 main network nodes sharing 35,069 channels.

The second balance attack also discovered the balances of randomly selected main network channels in a process of elimination with error messages. However, payment hashes were routed through two channels the researchers opened with two intermediate channels that sat between one start and one end channel.

Piecing together changes in balances learned from the first two attacks, the third attack constructed snapshots of the Lightning Network at different time intervals to detect payment movements and their senders, recipients and amounts.

“Identifying the sender and recipient means that we identify them according to their public keys and any other information linked to the node,” such as an IP address, a numerical string that tags the location of an electronic device that connects to the internet, she said. Public keys are handed out freely between parties in payment interactions; private keys that are guarded closely and that give ownership access of funds were not extracted.

Piotrowska noted that, owing to ethical concerns, the third attack was performed on a simulation of the Lightning Network.

Attack analysis

Mariusz Nowostawski, a computer scientist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and one of four authors of the April paper, said the March paper’s first balance attack is a derivative of “an older, known method” and that the second balance attack, while new, is limited to small-scale attacks.

The second balance attack “requires opening two channels for each single channel being probed, which is extremely costly as those opening and closing channels need to be on-chain,” Nowostawski said. “And it requires the balance in one of the channels to be placed on the side of the node being probed,” risking the attacker’s funds.

To stave off the loss of funds, an external liquidity service – similar to the Bitrefill liquidity provider used in the March paper attack – needs to fund the channel. Even so, the balance attack falls flat if a channel refuses to accept a channel opening, Nowostawski said.

The balance attack studied by the Luxembourger and Norwegian researchers doesn’t expend resources or rely on intermediate channels, said Nowostawski. The attack is also an error-message-reading algorithm that probes channels, but supposedly on a larger and faster scale that reduces new channel openings, fund lock-up time and contact with the bitcoin blockchain.

Benedikt Bünz, a Stanford University Applied Cryptography Group researcher, called the papers important to privacy in cryptocurrencies.

“For strong and good privacy, cryptographic solutions such as zero-knowledge proofs and confidential transactions are needed,” said Bünz. Zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic structure, could facilitate payments that don’t leave traces of information behind with another party.","advertisement

Market Overview

Bitcoin has seen an interesting week of trading as it rebounded from the support at $6,600 last week. The support here was provided by a rising trend line and was bolstered by a .236 Fib Retracement level. After rebounding, it went on to break above $7,000 but fell short at $7,200 this weekend which caused the coin to roll over again.

The cryptocurrency has since dropped beneath $7,000 and is now trading back at the support provided by the rising trend line.

Short term prediction: NEUTRAL

Bitcoin is considered neutral at the moment, however, if it drops beneath the support line and falls below $6,600, the market would be considered as bearish in the short term.

Looking ahead, if the sellers push beneath $6,650, the first level of support lies at $6,612 (.236 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, support lies at $6,400, $6,200, and $6,085 (.382 Fib Retracement).

On the other side, if the buyers step in and push higher, the first level of resistance lies at $7,000. Above this, resistance lies at $7,174 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement), $7,200, and $7,400. If the bulls can break $7,400, higher resistance lies at $7,676 (1.618 Fib Extension), and $8,000 (bearish .786 Fib Retracement).

The RSI is trading beneath the 50 line which indicates weak bearish momentum. If it continues to drop further beneath 50, we can expect Bitcoin to drop beneath $6,600.

Ethereum Price Analysis

ETH/USD – Daily CHART – SHORT TERM

Market Overview

Ethereum managed to increase as high as $191 this week where it met resistance at a bearish .618 Fibonacci Retracement level. More specifically, it was unable to break above resistance at $187 (1.618 Fibonacci Extension level). It rolled over from here to drop into support at $170.

Short term prediction: BULLISH/NEUTRAL

Etheruem is bullish right now after creating a fresh high for April. However, if it continues to fall and drops beneath $160 it would be considered neutral with a further drop beneath $150 turning the market bearish.

The first level of support lies at $167 (.236 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, support lies at $160, $152 (.382 Fib Retracement), and $140 (.5 Fib Retracement).

On the other side, if the bulls push higher, the first level of resistance lies at $176 (1.414 Fib Extension). Above this, resistance lies at $187 (1.618 Fib Extension), $191 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement), and $200.

The RSI is above 50 to show that the bulls are not willing to give up control of the market momentum which is a good sign for ETH.

Ripple Price Analysis

XRP/USD – Daily CHART – SHORT TERM

Market Overview

XRP rebounded from support at the rising trend line last week which allowed it to climb as high as $0.196 this weekend. However, we can see that it rolled over from here as it drops back into the support at $0.18 which is further bolstered by the rising support trend line.

Short term prediction: NEUTRAL

XRP remains neutral at this moment in time, however, if it was to break beneath $0.18 we could consider the market as bearish.

Beneath $0.18, the first level of support lies at $0.17 (.382 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, support lies at $0.159 (.5 Fib Retracement), $0.147 (.618 Fib Retracement), and $0.14.

On the other side, resistance is located at $0.19, $0.196, and $0.20. Above $0.20, higher resistance is found at $0.211, $0.22, and $0.229 (bearish .5 Fib Retracement).

ChainLink Price Analysis

LINK/USD – Daily CHART – SHORT TERM

Market Overview

ChainLink has been on an absolute surge during April as it manages to rise toward the $3.70 level. It has since dropped lower but has managed to find support at $3.40, where lies the .236 Fibonacci Retracement level.

Short term prediction: Bullish

ChainLink remains bullish right now but must break $3.70 to continue this bull run. A break beneath $3.40 would turn it neutral with a further drop beneath $3.00 turning it bearish.

If the sellers break $3.40, support can be found at $3.20 and $3.13 (.382 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, support lies at $3.00, $2.91 (.5 Fib Retracement), and $2.69 (.618 Fib Retracement).

On the other hand, the first level of resistance lies at $3.66 and $3.70. Above this, resistance lies at $3.80, $4.00, and $4.13 (1.272 Fib Extension level). Additional resistance lies at $4.38 (1.414 Fib Extension) and $4.50.

The RSI is well above 50 to indicate the bulls dominate the market momentum.

To keep track of DeFi updates in real time, check out our DeFi news feed Here.","Nearly $1 million in bitcoin and ethereum flowed into child pornography-linked wallet addresses in 2019, continuing a multiyear upward trend that captures the complicated realities of mass crypto adoption.

The statistic, disclosed in a Tuesday blog post by forensics firm Chainalysis, is a tiny sliver of overall crypto usage – even on March 31, 2019, one of the slower trading days of that year, Messari’s estimated $128 million worth of bitcoin in transit dwarfed the nearly $930,000 that Chainalysis traced to addresses flagged by the Internet Watch Foundation across 365 days.

But the troubling total nonetheless documents crypto’s growing popularity as a method of payment for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year, 32 percent more crypto value moved into CSAM than in 2018, which itself was 212 percent higher than 2017’s total. Chainalysis based its totals on the cryptos’ value at time of transaction.

The 2019 figure comes in spite of law enforcement agencies’ global rush to dismantle online CSAM operations, including some of the largest ever uncovered. March 2018’s cross-border takedown of the Welcome to Video CSAM ring shuttered a darknet site that had collected some 420 total bitcoin across its nearly three-year reign.

Traceability

While Welcome to Video’s downfall did not stop 2018 or 2019 from hitting record usage highs, it does illustrate one of the upsides – from a law enforcement standpoint – of people using crypto to pay for CSAM. Bitcoin and ether are inherently traceable, and when users pay for CSAM without attempting to thoroughly obfuscate their tracks, they’re surprisingly easy to find and jail.

Most of the funds come right from exchanges, said Nina Heyden, an economist at Chainalysis. Better yet: from compliant exchanges who collect their users’ identity data as required by law.

“The good thing about that is those exchanges often cooperate with law enforcement when law enforcement requests more information during investigations,” Heyden said."
2020-04-22,,"Anyone Can Host a Crypto Exchange - Tim Draper Backed Startup Launches New Wordpress Plugin

There’s a new plugin available that gives people the ability to launch a cryptocurrency exchange on any WordPress-based website. The project called Wpcryptoexchange is a product created by the Tim Draper-backed startup Draper Goren Holm. With the plugin, anyone can launch a digital currency trading platform that allows people to swap various cryptos and also allows website owners to collect trading fees.

Now Anyone Can Host a Crypto Exchange on Their WordPress Website

A developer named Goren Holm has released a new WordPress (WP) plugin that makes it so anyone can create a crypto exchange on a WP-based site. Holm’s new release leverages open source software called the Totle application programming interface (API). The API makes it so website owners can allow swaps using various cryptocurrencies including ETH, DAI, BAT, and WBTC.

“Using Totle’s API, I created a way for anyone to add a decentralized crypto exchange to their WordPress website,” Holm’s webpage called wpcryptoexchange.com explains. “It’s as simple as installing the plugin and typing [wpdex] into any page or post on your WordPress site.”

The step-by-step directions for installing the wpcryptoexchange plugin is fairly self-explanatory, and only takes a few minutes to get started. Essentially, all you have to do is download the zip file and unzip it with the plugins admin on any WP website. Then you need to click the “add new button” at the top and select the “Crypto-Exchange.X.X.zip” file you downloaded and finally upload it to the back end. After that, you simply activate the plugin and type: “[wpdex] into a page or post on your site, you’ll have your own cryptocurrency exchange that will route the trades across all decentralized exchanges,” the developer’s website details.

Applications Like Exchange-Powered WordPress Plugins Can Further Decentralize the Crypto Trading Industry

The venture capitalist Tim Draper, the well known investor who predicts that one BTC will be worth $250K by 2024, partnered with Holm last year. Moreover during the last two years, noncustodial and decentralized exchange (dex) platforms have been extremely popular. Especially since the strong arm of regulation has been cracking down on the crypto industry worldwide.

With Holm’s application, it means anyone can launch a crypto trading platform on their site, with just a few instructions from the developer’s webpage. Further, the Totle API can also be installed as a small crypto exchange widget, which can allow trading as well. If anyone can simply create a dex application with ease and host it on their website, regulators will have a hard time stopping free-market crypto trades. Both Totle and the wpcryptoexchange protocol’s codebases are available for review, so people can also check the software’s code for any vulnerabilities.

Venture Smart Asia Limited, is licensed by the SFC to manage virtual asset funds.

“This fund comes at a pivotal time for Bitcoin. By bridging the gap between the regulated finance and virtual asset world, institutions can gain secure access to Bitcoin via a conventional fund structure,” says Arrano Chief Investment Officer Avaneesh Acquilla. “We worked in accordance with the SFC guidelines to create a product that is the first of its kind, meets the needs of investors and complies with the highest regulatory standards.”

Acquilla joined Arrano Capital following nine years at Och-Ziff Capital Management in Asia. Prior to that he spent seven years at Goldman Sachs and UBS in London.

“Our goal is to create an institutional grade product and, to achieve this, we are exclusively operating with top tier counterparties,” says Acquilla.

The fund’s legal advisers are the award-winning international law firms Simmons & Simmons and Ogier. BitGo Trust Company will be the fund’s custodian. Mainstream Fund Services and Grant Thornton have been selected to support on fund administration and audit services respectively.

The Bitcoin fund is the first of two approvals for Venture Smart Asia Limited, the second will be an actively managed fund scheduled for launch later this year.

“We decided to launch this fund to address market demand from professional investors who are increasingly focused on Bitcoin as an alternative store of value,” says Acquilla. “Going forward, we see enormous potential for further passive and active products.”","The oil markets rebounded somewhat from the stunning, historic lows that started the week.

European markets saw gains, with the FTSE Eurotop 100 index closing in the green 1.9 percent, driven by oil-related stocks.

The S&P 500 index also ended the day on the plus side, up 2.2 percent. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury bonds sold off slightly as traders were willing to take on a little bit more risk in the equities market. Yields on the two-year, the 10-year and the 30-year Treasury bonds all rose (bond yields rise as prices fall). The yield on the 10-year climbed highest, to 6 percent at 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.

Despite Wednesday’s uptick, crude is not out of the woods. “Although OPEC production cuts are expected to kick off in May, weak demand and high global inventory mean that oil prices remain under pressure,” said Nemo Qin, senior analyst for multi-asset brokerage eToro.

The price of bitcoin climbed 3.4 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.

After starting at midnight UTC around $6,800, bitcoin saw some buying on spot exchanges like Coinbase. That pushed its prices above $7,000, breaking higher than its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for those who follow technical analysis.

“With the bitcoin halving fast approaching, where miners will see the amount of bitcoin mined from each node reduced by 50 percent, it could be that investors are choosing not to sell their holdings as we might expect,” said Simon Peters, another analyst at eToro. “Instead, they are staying in bitcoin so as not to miss out on the anticipated gains in the months following the halving.”

Digital assets are up on CoinDesk’s big board for the day. Ether (ETH) climbed 6 percent. The biggest winners today include dash (DASH) up 7.6 percent, stellar (XLM) gaining 6.9 percent and cardano (ADA) in the green 5 percent. All price changes are as of 20:45 UTC (4:45 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.

Ether beats bitcoin

Despite security concerns in the Ethereum-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, the price of ether continues to perform well, trouncing bitcoin since the beginning of the year, according to data from aggregator Coin Metrics. Year to date, bitcoin is flat while ether has seen 30 percent gains.

While ether’s prices have done remarkably well, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has been hit with smart contract security problems. That includes the bZx “flash loans” hack in February, when a hacker was able to drain $350,000 from the Fulcrum lending platform. In addition, more recently, the dForce protocol saw $25 million in crypto drained from the Lendf.me lending platform which was 99 percent of its total balance, although that attacker soon returned most of the funds.

It’s hard to place blame on protocols, says Neeraj Khandelwal, Co-founder of India-based exchange CoinDCX. “The latest news on DeFi’s security flaws have to do with the construction of the architecture on top of Ethereum, and not to do with the Ethereum protocol itself. As such, I do not expect the flaws of a limited number of DeFi projects to affect the price of ETH.”

Amount of ether locked in DeFi smart contracts versus price since 1/1/20 Source: CoinDesk Research

“The so-called security flaws are merely structural decisions that DeFi companies are making and not indicative of Ethereum itself,” according to Alexander Blum, Co-founder of Two Prime, a crypto asset management firm.

Companies, not protocols, are causing problems with DeFi, and Blum made a comparison to the critical web protocol HTTP – it has been hacked as well, usually due to bad security practices by organizations that cause issues. “Just like how we wouldn’t dismiss the entire HTTP protocol due to the hacking of a single website, it will be misplaced to deem Ethereum unsafe and insecure simply based on the flaws of DeFi companies.”

Ethereum as a cryptocurrency computing platform isn’t the only one suffering from hacks. The Factom protocol, a smaller rival to Ethereum, this week fell victim to a $11 million hack of stablecoin platform PegNet. Insiders have said the Factom PegNet hack looks similar to the Ethereum-based dForce attack, a sign hackers can be protocol agnostic with their tactics.

DeFi’s travails most likely doesn’t have an affect on ether’s price performance. Liquidity on exchanges, and not protocol fundamentals, could be ether’s key feature for traders.

“Ether and bitcoin have many similar attributes: easily accessible and tradable on global exchanges everywhere, used heavily for trading pairs, very little friction with cross-border trading, deemed not equities by the SEC,” said Coin DCX’s Khandelwal. “Their values — and in turn, their prices — aren’t necessarily tied to their technical attributes.”

“Gold prices are expected to be pushed higher due to investors flocking toward safe-haven assets,” said Nemo Qin, Senior Analyst eToro. “We can expect to see gold and gold-backed investments to continue to grow in 2020.”","Stablecoin issuances do not push up the price of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, according to research funded by University of California Berkeley’s Haas Blockchain Initiative.

In their report, issued Friday, Richard Lyons, U.C. Berkley’s chief innovation and entrepreneurship officer, and Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, assistant professor of finance at the Warwick Business School, found stablecoins serve as tools for investors to react to market movements and not as drivers of price inflation or collapse. Their analysis of trading data shows flows are consistent with investors using stablecoins as a store of value during periods of risk or price depreciation.

Lyons and Viswanath-Natraj also found “strong evidence” of another catalyst for flows from issuer treasuries to secondary markets: arbitrage trading when stablecoins deviate from their pegs.

Whether stablecoin issuances materially affect the price of cryptocurrencies is no small controversy.

In July 2018, research published by John Griffins of the University of Texas at Austin and Amin Shams of the Ohio State University concluded stablecoin issuances “are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in bitcoin prices.” The research further claimed that stablecoin flows and subsequent price inflation during 2017 were attributable to a single entity.

Four months after the Griffins and Shams study was released, the U.S. Department of Justice opened an investigation into whether Tether and Bitfinex have used stablecoin issuances to inflate the price of bitcoin.

A related class-action lawsuit was filed against dominant stablecoin issuer Tether and its sister company, Bitfinex, in late 2019. The claimants alleged Bitfinex and Tether “monopolized and conspired to monopolize the bitcoin market,” as well as manipulated the market via stablecoin issuance among other things. A pseudonymous online firebrand known as Bitfinex’d made similar claims about the companies in a series of detailed blog posts several years ago.

Directly contradicting Griffin and Shams, Lyons and Viswanath-Natraj summarize their conclusions by saying:

“We find no systematic evidence that stablecoin issuance affects cryptocurrency prices. Rather, our evidence supports alternative views; namely, that stablecoin issuance endogenously responds to deviations of the secondary market rate from the pegged rate, and stablecoins consistently perform a safe-haven role in the digital economy.”

The new feature allows Dharma users to send U.S. dollars to any Twitter handle, even if recipients don’t have a Dharma account. To get started, users would need to deposit funds into their Dharma accounts.

Dharma said recipients would start earning interest “as soon as” someone sends them money, even before claiming it. It is not clear how much is the interest rate, Dharma currently offers a 3.5% interest per annum, according to its website.

Founded in 2017, Dharma pivoted to a new Compound-connected platform in August 2019. It means rather than offering a platform built on its own proprietary smart contracts, Dharma enabled users to tap into Compound’s liquidity pool. This allows lenders to immediately earn interest on deposits.

What more could a burgeoning technology ask for to thrive? Massive global unemployment, cascading in waves as a viral pandemic shutters most parts of the non-digital economy, has put the world on the precipice of the “everything bubble” Satoshi Nakamoto sought to inoculate us against with the creation of bitcoin.

This is both the moment the cryptocurrency community has both eagerly awaited and dreaded. A global pandemic hitting just as sovereign currencies are being architected should serve as an accelerator for rapid issuance and acceptance. This should be true in particular for teetering third-world economies lacking a global reserve currency to inflate their monetary bases without hyperinflationary hell to pay. Additionally, there are undeniable health and hygiene benefits over paper currencies, not just better trackability for tax collection and law enforcement purposes.

The wheels of legislative and regulatory approval grind slowly in normal times, so it is encouraging that a preliminary digital dollar program nearly made it into the congressional aid package for displaced workers and shuttered businesses as a better way to quickly distribute the multi-trillion-dollar creation of magic Federal Reserve money. Sadly, it was pruned from the final bill on the legislative cutting room floor. Instead, we are left to fill out forms downloaded from bank websites that cannot handle the traffic. These loans may take months to process at a time when millions of recently unemployed workers have little to no savings.

Many of the industries where physical contact is required at the last mile are having their legacy supply chains disrupted. Seminars and conferences cannot take place in closed hotels with few planes to fly them in. Restaurants are restricted to take-out in most of the U.S. and Europe, India and large swaths of everywhere else.

Necessity, of course, is the mother of invention and this is where the token foundations and programmers need to step into high gear. They need to finalize and deploy solutions that have been in development for years for smart-contract supply chain management, international global e-commerce payments and remittances, and seamless exchange and wallet onramps and off-ramps to stored value. As the specter of bank runs and closures looms around the developing world, there is substantial demand for reliable asset-backed stablecoins, blockchain-backed precious metals ownership, security tokens sufficiently discounted for risk and for the nascent world of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is currently paying some of the highest interest of any asset class.

Who among us will become the Zoom of easy cross-border payments, of smart contract supply chain management and of clearly superior solutions in a dozen other categories.

Waiting for legacy global fiat off-ramps to embrace the blockchain in a world already hamstrung by multiple redundant KYC/AML approval loops to access one’s own money when the traditional economy is essentially on fire is a banana upon which the banking industry is poised to slip. Just as we now make our own masks and hand-fashioned bandanas for wearing inside supermarkets, we don’t have time to wait for congressional approval to accelerate the adoption curve for cryptocurrency and blockchain-based solutions.

Never has there been a time when Big Tech and Big Consulting are more in need of outside resources to scale solutions to fresh problems in multi-trillion dollar industries. These “too big to fail” firms are already on the pre-approved list for government and Fortune 500 contracts, but they tend to lack the nimbleness, open source ethos, and out-of-the box thinking employed by the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems.

One benefit that has come out of the sudden stoppage of physical events is the rapid rise of virtual events, conferences, seminars, networking lounges. Most of them are free after the price of an email address, others priced far less than online webinars of the past. Zoom and other platforms have done a remarkable job of emulating a real conference, including breakout rooms. Zoom (a company my firm briefly represented in its infancy) had to beat out legacy competitors with much larger funding including Cisco, Microsoft and Facebook with a superior interface and stellar execution to win the race (for the moment) as video webcasting king of the hill.

You can even have drinks together. I am in a WhatsApp group of bitcoin old-timers who created a Zoom cocktail party event every Friday afternoon since the pandemic took hold. I am in another group of tech and media leaders in Los Angeles who have used Zoom to both keep its current physical membership connected virtually but also to reconnect with its past members from around the globe for the chance to hear renowned speakers and network each Saturday morning. It’s still not the ability to hug or shake someone’s hand. But with virtual events, you can still look someone straight in the eye.

Now is the time for bold action by governments and industry to embrace the blockchain and crypto communities. We have not done the greatest job of educating one another about what it is we do and why – sometimes, physical events produce a lot of grandstanding and posturing, which seem harder to pull off in the intimate video closeups of the Zoom format. Let’s all do our part to connect the dots of the new virtual world with sound alternatives to the increasingly virtual fiat monetary supply and its creaky legacy framework.","With the lights turned off in museums and galleries thanks to the coronavirus, artists are now presenting their work in the digital glow of online showrooms.

Last month, Art Basel, an annual mecca for the globetrotting, art-buying class, showcased an estimated $270 million worth of paintings, sculptures and other fine art for view by anyone with an internet connection. This one virtual viewing room was just the beginning for an industry kneecapped by shelter-in-place and social distancing mandates, the New York Times reported.

This step towards democratizing access to art comes with its own handicaps. Physical artifacts brought online have a tendency to be reproduced and defaced. A once unique masterpiece – priceless in theory – becomes worthless if you can’t prove its authenticity, trust the seller or stop its forgery.

“If you’re buying in a digital showroom from a competent dealer, there’s a certain level of trust,” Harry Rinker, founder of Rinker Consulting, an appraisal firm specializing in antiques, art and collectibles, said in an interview. “But the truth is there are so many digital auction sites … there’s a certain risk for the average collector to be burned.”

As the traditional, $67.4 billion art market learns to adapt to this weird interlude – where time seems refracted and human connection is made impossible – the nascent industry of blockchain-based art galleries is seeing its value tested in real time. Long predicted as an inevitable disruptor to the art market, blockchain is now a potential lifeline as all art goes digital.

Just as bitcoin paved the way for trustless, peer-to-peer transactions by creating a shared ledger of events, crypto art, typically appended to the Ethereum blockchain as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has provenance built in. This transparent, immutable record of ownership is not only central to a functioning digital art economy but an improvement on a market that long relied on paper certificates, or sometimes PDF reproductions, of authenticity.

This is a new way of collecting art that makes a lot of sense in the digital age.

“This is a new way of collecting art that makes a lot of sense in the digital age,” said Max Osiris, an early buyer of NFTs. “The transactions are nearly instant, proof of ownership and provenance are obvious, the market is open 24/7 and there’s no geographical boundaries to who can create or collect art.”

What’s more, the same properties of cryptocurrencies that prevent double-spending ensure each work of crypto art is made digitally scarce, and therefore valuable.

Through the Gateway

That’s the thinking behind Nifty Gateway, a platform for the curation and sale of crypto art. Bought out last November by the crypto exchange giant Gemini, the firm has since hosted its first three “drops,” or exhibitions of one-of-a-kind digital artifacts. All have sold out within days of launch.

“We got a little lucky timing. I think people are spending more time with their computers and are really beginning to look seriously at digital arts for the first time,” said Duncan Cock Foster, the firm’s co-founder.

Founded with his twin brother Griffin as a paired-down tool to let people buy NFTs with their credit cards, Gemini’s backend now allows the platform to support a secondary market for trading NFT creations. It’s this innovation that’s making Nifty a legitimate counterweight to the troublesome situation of being an art collector under quarantine, and opening the possibility for new types of investing.

""Human Prøgress :[mea$ured in time]:,"" by Max Osiris, maxosiris.com

Art and collectibles are often categorized “alternative investments.” As tangible goods, they are considered inflation-resistant assets like gold, land and even bitcoin. But unlike other safe havens rocked by recent market turbulence, collectibles have largely held their ground.

“The market is controlled by investors,” Rinker said, speaking about the wider collectible economy. He did note that prices collapsed during recessions in 2008 and in the late 1980s after cash-strapped buyers exited. “Any market is only viable if it allows buyers to recover cash from one sale to another,” he said.

After only a month in operation, the works sold on Nifty’s secondary market have seen a steady increase in value. A piece called “Wings: Regular” created by New York-based pen-and-ink-gone-NFT artist John Guydo, listed in Nifty’s first drop for $20 is now selling for $250. Other works, taken in aggregate, have seen doubling in valuations, Griffin Cock Foster said.

This is in spite of an NFT market that has been hollowed out in recent years. Both Cryptokitties and CryptoPunks, the latter once popular enough to hang in Zurich’s Kate Vass Galerie, see abysmal transaction volume compared to their 2017 highs.

“According to my experience, it takes 30 years to create a viable secondary market. So anyone buying this stuff coming out new, has better expect to live for 30 years at least to see how it does. And my guess is that it won’t do very well,” Rinker said. (It’s worth noting that Rinker earned the epithet “Beanie Meanie” for calling the top of the Beanie Baby bubble, to which bitcoin is often compared.)

The Cock Foster twins have had a quality draw of the artists on display. The firm’s enigmatic owners, the Winklevoss twins, were able to rope in their photographer friend Lyle Owerko, who earned a reputation capturing the scene of the 21st century’s first crisis: the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.

Art is only collected by incredibly wealthy people, like rappers and bankers, yet [artists are] followed and adored by people that can't afford their art.

The craft of photography is as much a science as an art, which goes a long way in explaining why Owerko was attracted to making nifties. But he was also attracted by the prospect of reconnecting with an audience that can no longer afford his work.

“If the internet is the new gallery … then the only barrier is your choice whether to buy or not, not the velvet ropes of the traditional taste makers,” Owerko said. It was Owerko’s exhibition and praise for the platform that initially interested the founding creative director for Def Jam Recordings Cey Adams to participate in the latest Nifty drop.

“The stuff is moving fine,” Adams said of his pop-art imbued brand of graphic design. In a little less than a week, buyers have snatched the highest cost and most limited prints in his “Numbers” exhibition. “I’m still trying to wrap my mind around these people who care about this, why they care, and how anyone even knows about this,” he said.

Taking cues from the shuttered-for-now physical art galleries, Nifty is looking to run a show every two to three weeks, “and build a reputation as a gallery that displays high quality work consistently,” Duncan Cock Foster said.

What makes an NFT?

Browsing through the digital exhibitions, I was intrigued. Cey Adams’s work reminded me of a painting I had seen hanging in the galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, long before it closed its doors.

But what makes an NFT “high quality?” Where is the value in a digital reproduction, even if it’s one-of-a-kind and signed by a renowned artist? The Cock Foster twins said they don’t have access to much biographical information of Nifty users, but suspect they’re in their 30s, male and “interested in art and technology.”

Griffin and Duncan Cock Foster

Rinker, a man in his late 70s, said, “What do I want with a digital collection? Where’s the fun in something if you can’t hold it, play with it, and caress it.” Ryan Colditz, a crypto artist who works under the name Coldie, thinks that at least some of its value comes from its portability, especially as “our lives are becoming more digitally based.”

For others, the value is perhaps best described as intrinsic. “I think art is so personal. I know a lot of my collectors have said ‘this piece really speaks to me’ and that’s why they bought it,” Max Osiris, the early adopter, said.

While we may bemoan the loss of experiencing art firsthand, the possibility of creating in a new medium allows for radically new approaches to production. “We like to encourage our artists to really embrace the media… Like, hey, go crazy, make some animated digital artworks, make some vector files, do something that you can’t do in the physical media,” Duncan said.

“I know that to stand out, I have to keep making art that is relevant yet interesting in its own ways,” Osiris said. “It’s the age of experimentation really. There’s movements and there’s individual artists, particular pieces that tend to define these eras.”

Coldie agrees, and said crypto artists aren’t merely appending work to the blockchain, but telling the “culturally significant” story of blockchain as it develops.

Even if an artist can’t pin down why something resonantes, the immediacy of tokenizing a work and having it available to a global audience is helping artists, like Owerko, refine their style for the digital age.

“I have contemporaries whose art is only collected by incredibly wealthy people, like rappers and bankers, yet they’re followed and adored by people that can’t afford their art,” Lyle Owerko said in a phone call. “There’s this chasm between collectors and their audience.” Being able to sell a $20 nifty helps Owerko close the gap and rediscover what his art actually means to people.

That being said, not all in the crypto art world are supportive of Nifty’s project. “As far as we see [Nifty Gateway] doesn’t add too much innovation and takes a step in the wrong direction by using a centralized exchange as the core of its app,” said Nate Geier, CEO of Mintbase, another NFT platform.

Geier said sites such as SuperRare and KnownOrigin paved the way for attracting non-crypto users to think about digital assets, and fully decentralized sites like CryptoVoxels and OpenSea provided a place for people to use, display, and exchange these assets in the interoperable landscape.

“They never really walked me through what to expect. To be honest, I wish they gave me more advice about what I was doing and why I should care,” Cey Adams, an artist on Nifty Gateway, said of the Cock Fosters. “It would be nice if I could log in one day and see how this works and if I made money and if I can transfer it. But no one has done or said anything. It makes me wonder,” he said, taking a beat. “It doesn’t feel real.”","When Liliana Pertenava decided to go all-in on crypto by investing $2,000 in a mining rig in 2017, she went so far down the crypto rabbit-hole she decided to make a documentary about it.

Covering blockchain technology, its applications and the culture that surrounds it, Pertenava’s 90-minute documentary led her to meet such characters as a tribe of iconoclasts living in a small cabin in the Swiss Alps, using cheap, hydroelectric energy to mine cryptocurrency while living like monks. She also meets crypto-miner David Carlson in Seattle, Wash., who built the world’s largest crypto-farm, only to later go bankrupt.

It’s also likely to prompt feelings of nostalgia, not just for the heady days of crypto but also the fact that people are actually hanging out with each other (OMG).

To that point, stymied by COVID-19, Pertenava has decided to go through Vimeo to release the movie, so that people can watch it at home. “Also, since it’s a road movie, I hope to feed everyone’s wanderlust while the world is on lockdown,” she says.

A former broadcaster in Russia, Pertenava was intrigued by the decentralized nature of blockchain tech. “I felt a bit like Alice in Wonderland, exploring this strange world and its colorful characters,” said Pertenava. “We live in a world where digital technologies are transforming reality.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin shows high levels of correlation with the rest of the crypto market, but different altcoins nark different trends for BTC.

Zcash (ZEC), for instance, can be used to determine intermediate tops within the market.

Meanwhile, Stellar Lumens (XLM) has led the uptrend since the beginning of April suggesting that Bitcoin has more room to go up.

A high correlation between Bitcoin and multiple altcoins is helping to determine where the flagship cryptocurrency is headed next.

A Highly Correlated Market

A glimpse at Coin360’s cryptocurrency map reveals what is obvious to many.

Whenever Bitcoin goes up, most altcoins in the market are also likely to surge. And, whenever the flagship cryptocurrency drops, the other cryptos follow suit.

Over the years, some of the most prominent figures in the industry have argued that the high levels of correlation in the cryptocurrency industry are impeding Bitcoin from achieving its upside potential.

The key indicator for the start of a sustainable bull run is likely a decoupling of asset values from Bitcoin (i.e. Bitcoin’s strength weakens other networks or vice versa). Anything else is just speculation again (maybe we need another bubble to learn more lessons? ??)… — Vinny Lingham (@VinnyLingham) April 10, 2019

Instead of focusing capital on the only decentralized, trustless, and censorship-resistant cryptocurrency, investors are spread across Bitcoin and various altcoins.

It is not uncommon to see newcomers buying altcoins during market pumps. This behavior has helped strengthen the correlation between Bitcoin and most digital assets.

Indeed, data from CryptoWatch reveals that BTC and the top five altcoins by market cap have an average correlation coefficient above 0.8. This statistical value indicates a strong positive linear relationship between these cryptocurrencies.

While many see the high levels of correlation in the cryptocurrency industry as a negative sign, others have seized the opportunities it presents.

Zcash Leads the Downturns

In a recent blog post, Garry Kabankin, project coordinator at Santiment, explained that after a thorough analysis he noticed a particular pattern between Zcash’s (ZEC) price action and Bitcoin.

Each time this privacy coin rises and BTC does not follow, it usually results in a “local top,” said Kabankin. This market behavior began developing earlier this month and since then it has occurred three times.

Around Apr. 9, ZEC began surging as BTC remained flat and what happened next was a correction that was seen across the entire market. The same pattern repeated on Apr. 20, and then again roughly two days later.

While accurate, it is impossible to determine how long this pattern will continue forming.

Kabankin maintains that for the time being, market participants can employ this pattern as a “rare indicator” for determining intermediary tops.

XLM Leads the Run-Ups

If ZEC marks the price drops, Crypto Briefing researched other highly correlated assets to determine whether there was an altcoin that leads the run-ups.

It has become clear that Stellar Lumens (XLM) was the one.

On Apr. 5, for instance, XLM was already up 6.6% by the time Bitcoin began posting green. Five days later, Lumens had already advanced over 5% before the bellwether cryptocurrency entered a bullish impulse.

Today, Stellar managed to surge more than 11% while the price of Bitcoin was down by nearly 1%. However, Bitcoin soon followed XLM further confirming this unexpected correlation.

As Stellar Lumens continues its upward advance, it is reasonable to believe that BTC could advance further up.

An Upswing on Bitcoin’s Horizon

Due to the unpredictability of the market, however, every chart pattern and index must be taken with a grain of salt.

Thus, a look at BTC’s 1-day chart shows that the pioneer cryptocurrency is facing strong resistance ahead that could jeopardize the bullish outlook.

Within this time frame, the 100-day exponential moving average represents the barrier that Bitcoin must cross before further advance.

Turning this resistance wall into support could allow BTC to move towards its 200-day exponential moving average that sits around $7,900.

Conversely, a spike in the selling pressure behind Bitcoin around the current price levels could see it plunge. This drop would see the top crypto find support near the 50-day exponential moving average.

This support barrier is currently hovering at around $7,100.

Bitcoin: Moving Forward

While the technical patterns mentioned above can be used to determine short-term price movements, there are several fundamental factors that paint a clearer picture.

As Bitcoin’s halving event approaches, Google searches for the keyword “bitcoin halving” are skyrocketing. The interest for the pioneer cryptocurrency overtime recently reached an all-time high and it appears that there is more gas in the tank.

Bitcoin’s massive growth in popularity is being noticed by large market players who appear to be accumulating heavily. Data from Glassnode reveals that the number of addresses with 1,000 BTC or more recently reached a two-year high.

“This trend implies that despite an uncertain market environment, whales remain confident that now is a good time to be accumulating BTC, suggesting that they believe there is further room for growth,” said Glassnode.

Now, even Bloomberg analysts are bullish on Bitcoin stating that this year it could transition toward a “quasi-currency like gold.”

Given all the optimism surrounding the flagship cryptocurrency, it seems like it is just a matter of time before it resumes another historic uptrend.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin performed well during geopolitical turmoil, leading to the narrative that BTC moves in the opposite direction of stocks.

In the last month, the correlation between Bitcoin and stocks hit record highs, causing many to question Bitcoin’s claim as “gold 2.0.”

Bitcoin is an impossible-to-confiscate asset that opposes authoritarianism, giving it qualities as an effective political hedge.

Gold has a 2,700 year history as a form of money, making it the most reliable monetary hedge, for now.

Bitcoin’s market dynamics suggest that it is both a risk-on and risk-off asset, depending on the circumstances. These qualities make BTC tricky to use as a hedge against the stock market, and run contrary to many popular narratives.

Bitcoin and stocks fell and rallied together over the last two months. These moves were met by confusion, given that the historical correlation between the two assets has been low.

Historic data has shown that Bitcoin is bipolar. Sometimes it acts as an uncorrelated asset. Other times, it performs contrary to the stock market. Occasionally, it moves closely with the stock market. These moves provide valuable insight into the true nature of Bitcoin.

Geopolitics and Bitcoin

The global trade war was bad news for consumers and businesses, but good news for Bitcoin. Governments of various countries clashed with the United States over trade tariffs, creating a hostile international environment. This paved the way for the cryptocurrency to thrive.

In early 2020, Bitcoin’s anti-fragility was again put to test when tensions between Iran and the United States flared after a drone strike killed a high-ranking Iranian military official.

At that time, the cryptocurrency recorded a 53% gain between January and February 2020, in line with the theory that Bitcoin performs well when risk-assets, like stocks, take a beating.

Come March, however, the cryptocurrency crashed along with other risky assets. That month BTC had a record correlation with the S&P 500. This shocked many in the space, since the asset was believed to be both uncorrelated and resilient against economic turmoil.

The last month has provided more perspective on Bitcoin, gold, and the concept of hedging major macroeconomic risks. Bitcoin is often deemed to be “digital gold.”

But, it’s price is down 30% since Feb. 20, the day the stock market peaked, while gold is up 7% over the same period.

Bitcoin and Gold’s History as a Hedge

Gold’s history as a medium of exchange is even older than the concept of democracy, dating back to 700 BC. Even in modern history, the gold standard was around until 1971 in the United States. This track record has led much of the world to believe that the precious metal is a reliable form of money to fall back on.

Bitcoin’s roots are grounded in the 2008 financial crisis, where society paid the price for dreadful risk management by the big banks. However, at its core, Bitcoin is not a hedge against monetary manipulation, but a hedge against authoritarianism.

As an unconfiscatable asset, it provides the strongest resistance to the power of the state, unlike gold which is easy to confiscate.

With this in mind, it’s not surprising that Bitcoin fares well when geopolitical pressures mount. Like gun sales, BTC seems to do well when governments gain new and intrusive powers.

The Coronavirus pandemic has led to a situation where demand has collapsed and certain industries face prolonged slumps in sales. Retail consumers, moreover, are looking to avoid risky assets like Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, since this is an economic situation, it makes sense that gold, a monetary hedge, is faring better. Especially in the face of unprecedented government stimulus.

Though, in recent times, even the usually tame mainstream media has argued that governments are gaining too much power during this emergency—something they are unlikely to give up once the COVID-19 crisis is resolved.

So, the real question isn’t whether Bitcoin is a risk-on or risk-off asset. Instead, the question investors should ask is whether the current macroeconomic situation is one where BTC can thrive.

Demand shortages and reduced household incomes are not bullish for Bitcoin. People realizing that Bitcoin is the hardest form of money to confiscate, meanwhile, is bullish.

BTC lacks credence among the general population as a form of money, but its ability to act as a political hedge is definitive and corroborated by the market.

And, once Bitcoin becomes large enough to prove that it is a viable alternative to the traditional financial system, it will evolve beyond a hedge. Every application built around Bitcoin provides an alternative for consumers. Soon, people will no longer need to rely on the unscrupulous centralized financial system.

Bitcoin won’t replace gold. The two assets will co-exist for the foreseeable future. Instead, Bitcoin will transcend beyond gold 2.0, becoming a new kind of money the world has never seen before.","Bitcoin prices spiked to a new monthly high of over $7,725, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. The rally comes on the day before the expiry for CME April bitcoin futures.

According to comments shared with CoinDesk, bitcoin traders view Friday’s expiry as a primary catalyst for Thursday’s rally. There’s a “general expectation for a pickup in volatility” around CME expiry, said Kevin Kelly, former equities strategist at Bloomberg and co-founder of Delphi Digital. But bitcoin was “primed for a move given the recent consolidation,” said Kelly.

Over $68 million worth of contracts were liquidated on BitMEX Thursday morning, according to data from Skew, as futures open interest is still recovering from a 50 percent plunge at the end of Q1 2020.

Thanks to bitcoin’s “strong macro fundamentals,” we’re “seeing buying interest coming back,” Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk in a private message.

“Stocks look really strong,” another trader who expects bitcoin and equities to continue rallying together told CoinDesk in a private message.

Called SmartSessions, the Ethereum-based crypto paywall developed by 2key New Economics allows firms and “solopreneurs” to take advantage of crypto payments when offering services through Zoom.

The company told CoinDesk in an email the solution would help people pushed out of their normal premises – for example, teachers of activities such as yoga, advisers or mentors – a way to offer video sessions and still receive payments.

SmartSessions utilizes the Ethereum network and smart contracts, via 2key’s existing SmartLink platform, to create a number of automated and self-managed features.

After a session is set up in the app, it generates a personalized Zoom link and sends it to the target audience, processing payments automatically. Session hosts can also view metrics for data such as ticket sales and invite views.

Tickets for Zoom sessions can currently be purchased with ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH). 2key said automated swaps between ether and dai, tether (USDT) and trueUSD (TUSD) are coming soon via crypto liquidity network Kyber. Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto options are slated to be available next quarter.

Ticket purchasers will be able to buy ether using a credit card within the app, paying with a choice of 17 different fiat currencies. Third parties are also able to earn ETH rewards for sharing the Zoom invites, getting a portion of any ticket sales they generate.

Currently, businesses wanting to take payment for Zoom sessions will need to use PayPal or bank transfers, with each attendee needing to be billed separately.

2key said problematic “Zoom-bombing” – whereby unwanted parties join a call for the purposes of disruption –would likely be a non-issue as only paying parties will have access to a session.","A recent report by Grayscale, the world's largest digital currency asset manager, revealed the firm now holds roughly 1.7% of all of Bitcoin’s supply in its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Having seen the biggest quarter yet, Grayscale’s share of Bitcoin increased by 0.1% in 2020 despite current market uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of investor relations, told Cointelegraph that “the majority of capital invested into our products comes from institutional investors.” He elaborated:

“We saw 88% of the $503.7M in capital invested into our family of products come from institutional investors this past quarter. Our recent conversations with investors reinforce the idea that now, more than ever, investors are going to be looking for ways to build resilient portfolios. Moreover, the implications of the current, unprecedented monetary policy are causing previously skeptical investors to take another hard look at the asset class.”

While the Bitcoin Trust is the most popular among the company’s family of products, the increased inflow was experienced across the board, with Bitcoin (BTC) and all other altcoin-based trusts seeing around half a billion dollars in investment — double that of Q3 and Q4 2019. In Q1 2020, approximately 38% of Grayscale’s investors entered multiple Grayscale products in order to diversify their crypto holdings.

The Grayscale Bitcoin trust received around $389 million in investment throughout the quarter, which means that if GBTC was an exchange-traded fund, it would be among the 5% of year-to-date inflows. Moreover, GBTC is also one of most-traded OTC securities and has received the title of one of the most active securities in terms of trading volume in 2019, which further signals demand among institutional investors and traders.

While GBTC also targets retail investors, institutional players make up the overwhelming majority of capital inflow. Institutional investors represented 88% of the investment capital generated in the first quarter of 2020, most of which are hedge funds.

Has institutionalization arrived?

Grayscale was the first regulated crypto product to hit the market, having been launched in 2013. Since then, the company has expanded into a number of altcoin-based funds. However, the supply of options for institutional exposure has continued to grow, especially over the last couple of years.

Exchange-traded products like the physically-backed Bitcoin ETPs from Amun AG and from WisdomTree — both of which are currently trading in the Switzerland SIX stock exchange — are an example of readily available exposure for institutional players.

Most recently, 3iQ has announced the launch of its Bitcoin close-end fund on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which leverages price indexes by CryptoCompare and VanEck Europe subsidiary MVIS and custody services by Gemini. Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini’s president, recently told Cointelegraph: “This mirrors the growing appetite that institutional and retail investors alike are demonstrating for incorporating crypto assets into their larger portfolios.”

Exposure to derivative products has also become widely available for institutional investors in the last month through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin futures and options contracts as well as Bakkt’s physically-settled Bitcoin futures and LedgerX’s regulated derivatives products.

It’s important to note that the interest and volume on these paper markets is miniscule when compared to unregulated activity. According to Jonathan Hobbs — chartered financial analyst, author of The Crypto Portfolio and the chief operating officer at Ecstatus Capital — institutional demand is already here, but the challenge is finding compliant products that can satisfy their standards. Hobbs told Cointelegraph:

“As time goes by more traditional hedge funds, fund of funds and family offices are starting to see that Bitcoin and digital assets can offer them diversification. The main challenges for them lie in having digital investment products that will pass their compliance checks. Over the last few years we have seen the digital space mature considerably, with several infrastructure improvements that are making Bitcoin more accommodating to professional investors.”

Market sentiment among institutional investors

Grayscale’s results are impressive and show that institutional investors are looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets even during the current climate, where uncertainty and fear are becoming the norm. However, given the current state of affairs, Bitcoin is left for those with a higher risk appetite. Matt D’Souza, CEO of Blockware Solutions and digital currency hedge fund manager, told Cointelegraph, “Markets turn on a dime. If you’re not in when the opportunity presents, you’re too late.” He then added:

“While some institutional investors may be looking to bet on Bitcoin on the basis it could theoretically do well in a crisis, managers for the most part want cash which is by far the safest option. Managers that have been around for a long time understand how to last. It’s because their investors are in the stay rich business, not the get rich. This environment warrants capital preservation. As risk appetite comes back into the market I expect Bitcoin to be one of the best opportunities.”

In fact, while compliant offers for BTC are on the rise, data shows that, as of late, regulated derivatives have been losing ground both in terms of volume and open interest in contracts. This trend is observed only in regulated markets, while unregulated derivatives products had their biggest month yet in March in terms of trading volume.

This may suggest that institutional investors who are betting on Bitcoin are doing so as part of a longer-term strategy, given the increased interest in passive products like GBTC but decreased interest for CME’s futures and options.

This trend may soon pivot as large players enter the field. For example, Renaissance Technologies’ Medallion Fund — a hedge fund with $10 billion worth of assets under management — has recently received approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to offer products and services involving the CME-regulated Bitcoin futures market to its clients.

Regulation is key

While institutional interest and offerings both seem to be on the rise, there is still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to Bitcoin. There are many aspects in play, from the technology to monetary policy (especially with the upcoming halving), and most importantly, regulation. Bitcoin is still threading uncharted territory when it comes to compliance, and research shows that news involving clear regulatory updates increase demand for Bitcoin.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has become an SEC-reporting security, which shows that regulators are willing to work with companies in the industry. According to Sharif-Askary, this type of collaboration is helping drive the industry forward. Sharif-Askary told Cointelegraph that regulators seem “eager to engage, especially from an educational perspective.” He went on to add that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust becoming regulated by the SEC is a vital step:

“This means that the Trust is held to the same reporting and disclosure standards as stocks and ETFs that trade on national exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq. It also reinforces that there are ways to proactively work with regulators, within the existing regulatory frameworks.”

What about a Bitcoin ETF?

While the long-awaited Bitcoin exchange-traded fund is still nowhere to be seen, it seems that institutional demand is already here. While the cryptocurrency industry still needs to make adjustments to ensure more transparency and compliance, it seems that the right steps are being taken. In the meantime, regulated alternatives to the Bitcoin ETF continue to increase.

Related: The SEC Does Not Want Crypto ETFs — What Will It Take to Get Approval?

The latest attempt at a Bitcoin-related ETF was made by Wilshire Phoenix. The proposal was rejected by the SEC, who cited lack of a surveillance-sharing agreement with a significant market for the underlying asset or a novel demonstration of the market’s inherent resistance to manipulation.

Nevertheless, companies in the space are pushing toward a more transparent market. Crypto data forensics companies are working alongside service providers and regulators to create a more transparent market, which will play a big role in the approval of an ETF. However, according to Hobbs, this may not be as significant as the community thinks:

“With crypto products such as the CME Bitcoin Futures, the Grayscale BTC Trust in the U.S. and the Wisdom Tree Bitcoin ETP, there are already options for institutions to get Bitcoin exposure without having to buy it directly. Also, not all institutional investors who want to go digital are looking for passive 'buy and hold' Bitcoin exposure, which is what you get with an ETF. Many of them are looking for regulated digital quant funds like Ecstatus Capital which can trade Bitcoin long and short.”

Whether 2020 becomes the year of the Bitcoin ETF is unclear, but one thing is certain: Compliant options exist and are becoming increasingly available. With or without an ETF, regulation is the key to advancing the industry, and if the industry continues to mature, an ETF may be just another milestone on Bitcoin’s road to mass adoption.","Bitcoin Deutsche Bank Vet Bullish on Crypto, Launching Bitcoin Trading Desk in May

Deutsche Bank has long been bullish on crypto assets like Bitcoin, and the culture has spilled over into the company’s executives.

One of the bank’s veterans and former FX Japan Managing Director is even launching a crypto trading desk of his own, set to launch this coming May 2020 – right when Bitcoin’s halving is expected to drive significant interest in the asset class.

Deutsche Bank Alum Launching Bitcoin Trading Desk FXcoin This Coming May

There’s no denying that crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and more, are high risk, high reward assets. But their future and potential are so promising, its difficult not to be bullish on the digital currencies and at least consider them as part of a well-diversified portfolio.

That’s exactly Tomoo Onishi’s ticket to driving success in his up and coming Bitcoin trading desk, named FXcoin LTD., which the former Deutsche Bank Managing Director is launching this May.

RELATED READING | HERE’S WHY THIS BILLIONAIRE JUST APPLAUDED CHAINLINK AND COMPARED IT TO BITCOIN

In an interview with Bloomberg, Onishi agreed that while there is “no asset that’s absolutely safe” from the recent recession and coronavirus related market chaos, he asserts that he is a “bull on virtual currency prices,” which he expects to rise in the coming months. The launch of his platform will coincide with what could bring more interest to the cryptocurrency space since Bitcoin’s 2017 bubble: the upcoming block reward halving.

Onishi envisions a scenario where stimulus packages flood the economy with excess cash, and some of it makes its way into crypto assets like Bitcoin.

And with Bitcoin’s halving less than three weeks away, there’s an additional catalyst ready to help push prices higher, further inciting FOMO from investors sidelined with cash burning holes in their pockets.

New Japanese Crypto Exchange Could Bring a Resurgence of Interest in Region

FXcoin is backed by giant SBI Holdings Inc, a Japanese conglomerate with a stake in the crypto space and is one of just 23 entities registered with Japan’s Financial Services Authority.

Japan was once a hotbed for cryptocurrency exchanges, but a series of high-profile hacks in 2018 has led to a decline in interest in the country. The hacks promoted Japanese FSA to tight up restrictions in the region, which prompted some exchanges to close up shop. Others were issued with fines until the industry shaped up.

Much of it was prompted from just one, historic cryptocurrency exchange hack. The cryptocurrency platform CoinCheck was breached, and hackers made off with over $500 million worth of cryptocurrency tokens.

The hack was a major blow to the industry and set the space back years in Japan. It’s only now, as more companies like FXcoin open their doors that the industry in that region will begin to turn around.

If bitcoin were a government-issued currency, it would be one of the world’s top performers – beating not only popular emerging-market tenders like the Mexican peso and South Africa’s rand, but also advanced-nation stalwarts like the euro, British pound and Canadian dollar.

“Bitcoin is behaving as a store of value much the same as king dollar is behaving as a store of value,” Paul Brodsky, partner at cryptocurrency and blockchain investment firm Pantera Capital, said in a phone interview.

Many cryptocurrency investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold. And many of those investors believe bitcoin will eventually benefit from the Fed’s trillions of dollars of emergency money injections, which could spur inflation over the long term.

But guess what bitcoiners can already cheer about? Beating the euro during a year that the International Monetary Fund predicts will see the world’s worst recession at least since the 1930s.

“What you would expect to see going forward are hard assets, like gold and bitcoin, outperform as fiat currencies get depreciated,” said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of cryptocurrency analysis firm Digital Asset Research.

Think about it this way: Dollars have been in such high demand from investors, businesses, governments and central banks around the world that the Federal Reserve has had to inject more than $2 trillion of new money into financial markets just to preserve stability.

There’s no real comparison, of course, between the bitcoin market and the global market for dollars: The total outstanding value of all bitcoin ever created is currently around $130 billion, less than 1/100th of the $16 trillion U.S. money supply.

But as an investment, bitcoin is beating most world currencies and breaking even with the dollar.

One of the Fed’s motivations for the massive money injections is, ultimately, just monetary policy: The U.S. central bank is trying to counteract the powerful deflationary forces of an economic contraction.

Oil, which is priced in dollars, is now trading at about $14 a barrel, down from $61 at the start of the year, based on the benchmark U.S. futures contract. That’s deflation – a classic economic reaction to falling demand.

Bitcoin, by contrast, has held its value: One unit of the cryptocurrency now buys 507 barrels of oil, about five times what it could at the start of the year.

Any currency’s ultimate value is its purchasing power. And bitcoin is holding its own against the almighty dollar.

BTC: Price: $7,081 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $7,186 | 24-Hr Low: $6,943

Trend: Bitcoin is in the green again Thursday, after a small rally on light trading volumes.

The top cryptocurrency is currently trading near $7,100, representing a 2 percent gain on the day. The cryptocurrency continues to show no real sign of breaking from the recent narrow range between $6,500 and $7,300.

The MACD, an indicator used to judge momentum and change in trend, shows the potential for a move to the downside, courtesy of falling histogram bars hovering near the neutral 0 line.

Should a loss at the 50-day moving average occur (yellow line on chart) – currently around $6,771 – a deeper drawdown shouldn’t be ruled out. A likely area of support in such a case would be toward the bottom of the range at $6,520 – a level that has held steady since April 2.

The relative strength index (RSI) is trending bullishly, however. Should the bulls defend the 50-day average and the RSI doesn’t dip too far toward oversold, a bounce toward $7,300 is also plausible.

For now, traders will have to wait and see which direction is offered, as the all-important daily average should provide greater clarity moving forward.

As reported by Blomberg on Thursday, the exchange will initially offer services with Bitcoin, however, it has plans to expand services with other popular digital currencies including Ripple and Litecoin.

The exchange is also aiming to build a swap market, offering investors a tool for hedging on the price volatility.

Headed by Tomoo Onishi, FXcoin was formed more than two years before and received approval from the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) to offer crypto trading services. Notably, only 23 exchanges have received the mandatory FSA license to legally operate in Japan, a few of which are yet to start a business.

The report detailed that FXcoin has already started the registration process for on-boarding customers.

Making the pandemic an opportunity

Onishi is also taking the opportunity to start the trading services when the world is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic as he believes that people receiving stimulus cheques might end up investing in digital currencies.

We have seen a similar trend in the United States when Coinbase revealed that crypto buying transactions with $1,200 spiked after the government provided a pandemic stimulus of the exact amount.

Though many saw crypto as an alternative asset immune to the current economic stress, the market followed the traditional assets to take a sharp downturn. However, with upcoming major events like Bitcoin halving and release of Ethereum 2.0, the prices are recovering again.

“There is no asset that’s absolutely safe,” Onishi told Bloomberg. But he is “a bull on virtual currency prices.”

He came from the traditional finance industry after spending over 17 years at Deutsche Bank in leadership roles.","Why did this happen?

2020-04-24,"Contrary to expectations, bitcoin could see a positive performance during a possible bout of global deflation if it acts not just as an investment asset, but as a medium of exchange and a perceived safe haven like gold.

The top cryptocurrency by market value is widely considered to be a hedge against inflation because its supply is capped at 21 million and its monetary policy is pre-programmed to cut the pace of supply expansion by 50 percent every four years.

As such, one may consider any deflationary collapse as a price-bearish development for bitcoin. Talk of deflation began earlier this month after the U.S. reported massive job losses due to the coronavirus outbreak. The prospects of a deflationary collapse have strengthened with this week’s oil price crash.

“The oil price rout will send a deflationary wave through the global economy,” tweeted popular macro analyst Holger Zschaepitz on Tuesday.

Cash typically becomes king during deflation because the drop in the general price levels boosts the monetary unit’s purchasing power, or the ability to purchase goods and services.

“Unlike inflation, when people try to get out of the dollar because it’s losing value, during deflation people are more comfortable with the dollar because its value is going up,” said Erick Pinos, ecosystem lead for the Americas at the public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform Ontology.

The rush for cash, however, may not have a substantially negative impact on bitcoin’s price because deflation would also boost the purchasing power of the cryptocurrency.

“While the price per coin may stagnate during a period of aggressive economic deflation, the inherent buying power of the currency will actually rise, possibly quite significantly,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO of the bitcoin ATM provider Bitcoin Depot.

As time goes on and people become more comfortable with digital assets, the average person begins to see Bitcoin as a legitimate viable alternative to gold.

The uptick in the purchasing power will likely draw greater demand for bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency is already used as means of payment.

“Hundreds of thousands of businesses, brands and merchants do accept the ‘digital gold’ as payment, and thousands more every day are realizing the benefits of diversifying their revenue stream and accepting bitcoin as payment for their goods and services,” said Derek Muhney, director of sales and marketing at Coinsource, the world’s leader in Bitcoin ATMs.

Moreover, the cryptocurrency’s appeal as a medium of exchange is likely to continue strengthening with the growing prevalence of technology in consumers’ everyday lives caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Digital gold

Ever since its inception, bitcoin has been dubbed “digital gold.” Like the yellow metal, the cryptocurrency is durable, fungible, divisible, recognizable and scarce.

Both assets share features that fulfill Aristotle’s call for a currency to be practical and functional. Bitcoin has actual utility as the means of payment, which gold lacks, according to Coinsource’s Muhney.

“As time goes on and people become more comfortable with digital assets, the average person begins to see Bitcoin as a legitimate viable alternative to gold. Thus, it’s reasonable to assume that during a period of deflation bitcoin would perform well like gold has in the past,” said Erick Pinos, America’s ecosystem lead at the public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform Ontology.

Hence, gold’s performance during the previous bouts of deflation could serve as a guide for bitcoin investors.

Historical data shows gold performs well during deflation, which includes a sharp rise in financial stress and increased risk of corporate defaults; highly levered companies tend to go bust during deflation because their revenues fall while their debt service payments remain the same.

Of course, gold’s shine is particularly bright during periods of inflation as well. As in periods of sizable deflation, inflation brings a set of price distortions that shake-up income statements and economies.

A commonly-used measure of stress is the “Ted spread” or the difference between the three-month U.S. interbank rate and the three-month T-Bill rate.

Ted Spread Source: St. Louis Fed Research

“Massive spikes in the Ted spread in the 1970s were accompanied by a sharp rise in gold. The Ted spread also rose sharply in the early 1980s; in 1987 in the wake of the stock market crash and during the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 – both also periods of stronger gold prices,” according to Oxford Economics’ research note.

Gold's performance in stress periods Source: Oxford Research

The real or inflation-adjusted price of gold rose an average 33 percent per annum in the 1970s, 18 percent in 1980s and 15.8 percent in 2000.

Underscoring all of the scenarios is that a sudden rise in economic stress usually fuels a global dash for cash, forcing investors to sell everything from stocks to gold. However, once economic uncertainty starts settling, people again start looking for safe havens.

“During the Great Recession, while gold initially declined alongside other equities, it found its footing and rallied faster than stocks recovered,” Ontology’s Pinos told CoinDesk.

The Ted spread spiked as high as 4.6 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in August 2008. Gold fell from $920 to $680 per troy ounce in the August to October period, as investors treated the yellow metal as a source of liquidity, but still ended that year with 5.5 percent gains. More importantly, it rallied by 24 percent in 2009 and went on to hit a record high above $1,900 in 2011.

The yellow metal’s recent price gyrations suggest history may be repeating itself. As the Ted spread rose from 0.11 to 1.42 in the four weeks to March 27, gold fell from $1,700 to $1,450 yet is now trading near $1,725 per ounce, having hit a 7-year high of $1,747 ten days ago.

Bitcoin, too, was treated as a source of liquidity last month, as evidenced from the near 40 percent drop to levels under $4,000 seen on March 12. Since then, however, the cryptocurrency has risen by nearly 85 percent to $7,500.

If gold’s historical data and the recent market activity is a guide, then the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side.

Unprecedented stimulus to undermine fiat currencies

Both the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have unleashed massive amounts of liquidity into the system over the past few weeks to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

Notably, the Fed is running an open-ended asset purchase program and its balance sheet has already risen to record highs above $6.5 trillion. Meanwhile, central banks from New Zealand to Canada have slashed rates to zero and have recently announced bond purchase programs.

What’s more, the amount of fiscal stimulus announced by 22 countries in March is equivalent to 75 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), according to JPMorgan.

However, most governments and central banks appear to have run out of ammo. Hence, if the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread or leads to corporate defaults, investors may lose trust in traditional finance and look for alternatives like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.

Moody’s Analytics recently warned of the heightened risk of corporate defaults in the oil and gas sector across the globe, and weakness in entertainment and leisure giving way to pressure on consumer durables.

“The willingness to fight deflation should bode well for bitcoin,” said Richard Rosenblum, head of trading at GSR.

Meanwhile, Ashish Singhal, CEO and founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinswitch.co, said, “In a deflationary scenario, the chances of negative interest rates are high, and users would want to move their existing assets into more stable assets like bitcoin to prevent loss in their asset value.”

Interest rates are already set below zero across Europe and in Japan and are hovering at or near zero in other advanced countries.

Further, with central banks willing to do whatever it takes to defeat deflation, the real yield or inflation-adjusted returns on bonds are likely to remain negative or meagerly positive at best. As a result, zero-yielding assets like gold and bitcoin may attract more buyers.

Bank of America’s analysts noted earlier this week that the stimulus frenzy amid the coronavirus pandemic would put pressure on the currencies and send gold to $3,000 by October 2021.","Bitcoin Bitcoin Forms Super Predictive Golden Cross as Price Hits $7.5K

Bitcoin closed above $7-400-7,500 resistance Thursday, confirming its likelihood to extend its bull run towards $8,000.

The formation of a super predictive Golden Cross pattern hints a price rally to the upside is imminent.

The only nag is a Rising Wedge pattern that could lead its price below $5,500.

At last, bitcoin was able to break above the price ceiling that was keeping it from pursuing a more significant bull run.

The benchmark cryptocurrency jumped above $7,500 this Thursday in a surprising buying action that pushed the prices up by $704 in just three hours. It topped at $7,775 on Coinbase before correcting lower during the early Asian trading session Friday.

The crypto has been able to navigate through the heavy resistance labeled on the chart seen above. Nevertheless, the interim price rally paused for a breather, indicating that traders are waiting for a bullish continuation before they buy bitcoin at local tops. It may lead to a sharp pullback to the downside.

A Better Golden Cross Spotted

As bitcoin aims to confirm an extended bull run, the cryptocurrency also has painted a historically accurate and super predictive Golden Cross.

The bullish indicator is formed when an asset’s short-term moving average closes above its long-term moving average. Bitcoin traders typically watch 50-daily and 200-daily MA curves to confirm a Golden Cross – or its opposite, the bearish Death Cross. But those metrics have so far proven to be lagging.

In retrospect, the daily bitcoin chart forms a Golden Cross almost a month after the prices go up. Similarly, the cryptocurrency falls way before it paints a Death Cross pattern. That keeps traders from locating interim profitable opportunities.

But replacing 200-daily simple moving average with a 20-daily exponential moving average improves the predictive quality, as shown in the chart below via red circles.

The 20-50 MA combo instantly predicts bitcoin’s next potential moves. As of Friday, the 20-daily EMA is above the 50-daily SMA, hinting that the BTCUSD exchange rate is looking to head higher. A similar formation earlier this year had pushed the pair up by more than 40 percent.

So, in the current scenario, the bitcoin price can rise to as far as $10,000.

Bitcoin Rising Wedge

On the flip side, bitcoin is still trending higher inside a Rising Wedge pattern, as confirmed by two converging trendlines. The cryptocurrency could continue rising until it reaches the shape’s apex. After that, it could fall by as much as the height of the Wedge, leading it below the $5,000 level.

Nevertheless, Italian-Cuban entrepreneur Mazzola developed the country’s first decentralized Bitcoin exchange QBita earlier this month, according to market sources.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

“I created Qbita Exchange because I have always been convinced that here, in Cuba, Bitcoin is a real necessity,” Mazzola told a cryptocurrency news outlet.

He explained that in order for Cuba to catch up to other parts of the world, the country needs tools to buy, sell, use and store Bitcoins easily and safely. “Qbita solves all these problems,” Mazzola claimed.

Qbita wallet

Despite the lack of regulatory framework for crypto, Mazzola launched Bitcoin wallet, Qbita wallet, in November last year.

Qbita wallet is designed to work anywhere in the world, but it is especially meant to meet the needs of data-strapped Cubans.

Its installation only requires roughly 1MB of hard drive space and relatively little bandwidth.

That wallet now supports a built-in peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platform, allowing its Cuban users to trade BTC from within their wallets in a secure, decentralized manner with full control over their funds.

Little competition in Cuba

According to Mazzola, other Cuban P2P exchanges such as Paxful and LocalBitcoins have similar services but neither of them is particularly good for Cubans as each of them has “a little problem”.

Suggested articles Top 6 Crypto Trading Tools You Should Use in 2021Go to article >>

He said that Paxful is actively blocking Cuba, LocalBitcoins is asking you for KYC, and because of the embargo, this legal requirement is not helping the people of the island, so it’s not available in Cuba.

Qbita works by creating a multi-signature address controlled by the buyer, the seller, and the platform, Mazzola explained.

“If the trade goes well, both the buyer and the seller sign the transaction, which is executed instantly. If something goes wrong, the parties send their evidence to Qbita which signs in favor of the rightful owner, immediately executing the transfer”, he said.

Mazzola noted that, despite initial scepticism, the wallet’s acceptance and popularity as a P2P trading platform has increased considerably.

Since the launch of Qbita exchange, the number of registered downloads has gone up 1,100 from 850, marking a 30% increase in just a week, he added.

Only just starting

Qbita’s growth has come strictly from word of mouth, according to the Cuban entrepreneur.

“We’ve invested zero in advertising,” he said.

And the Qbita developer has only just started. He is currently building a payment gateway for businesses that would like to begin accepting cryptocurrency. The initiative has yet to take flight, he said, because e-commerce is still in its infancy in Cuba.

“I think that in the future we’re going to see fewer people coming to crypto just to make some easy money,” Mazzola said. “We’re going to see more people using Bitcoin for its true purpose: the freedom to move money and to have total control of your funds,” he concluded.","How China’s New National Cryptocurrency Changes Everything

17,904 reads

China is launching a national cryptocurrency. In this article, we’ll tell you what information is already known about the project at the moment as well as how it may change the financial world.

A couple of weeks ago, it became known that on April 25, 2020, China will launch its national blockchain platform called BSN (Blockchain Service Network). Many believe this is the first, fundamental step before the launch of a global financial project - a government-backed cryptocurrency called DC/EP. And it seems that the country is taking this initiative more seriously than ever before.

Based on the screenshots that appeared online recently, it is clear that the crypto-yuan will be launched soon enough. More and more experts are saying that this could change the entire global financial system. So, what is known at the moment and what conclusions can be drawn from it?

A bit of history

In October 2019, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, said that the development of blockchain technology is one of the priorities of the state and called for accelerated growth of the industry. By that time, it was already known that China had been developing its own cryptocurrency since 2014.

News about this periodically surfaced, although most crypto enthusiasts know China more for their strict regulatory actions — significant restrictions on cryptocurrency investment, the inclusion of mining in the preliminary stop-list of industries that should be banned, closure of blockchain conferences by the police, and so on.

Much has changed since Facebook published their initial plans for Libra. The prospect of a private company with 2.3 billion users worldwide issuing its own currency made the idea much more real to governments around the world.

China took it as an incentive. First of all, to compete with the dollar in the digital payments market and, ultimately, to change the entire global financial system.

Looking at the example of China and understanding what the future may hold, many other countries have announced the development of their own CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). For example, central banks for the European Union, South Korea, Russia, Sweden and a number of other countries have announced their own developments in the field of state cryptocurrencies.

Reviewing the BSN screenshots.

In April 2020, screenshots of the first version of the digital yuan application appeared online. According to preliminary data, the tests began among the ""white list"" of clients of the Agricultural Bank of China (the 7th bank in the world in terms of net profit) in four pilot regions: Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Chengdu, and Suzhou. In April, Suzhou enterprises even intend to pay 50% of transport subsidies to local workers in the new digital currency.

Several basic functions can be seen in the screenshots, and the interface is very similar to other Chinese payment platforms such as Alipay and WeChat Pay. Also, according to various statements of officials, it is already possible to understand many features and functions of the future cryptocurrency. I tried to gather all the information from different sources together.

So, what is known at the moment about the crypto yuan?

A list of all the important facts about the digital yuan:

The Chinese cryptographic currency will be called DC/EP, which stands for Digital Currency Electronic Payment.

The Central Bank has not yet officially confirmed the schedule for the introduction of the digital yuan, but many sources talk about a full launch in mid-2021.

Besides the standard ability to receive and send payments, one of the main functions is called 'touch and touch' - it allows two people to simply touch their mobile phones to make a transfer.

Transfers can be made without an internet connection on devices with NFC technology or Bluetooth. Offline transactions are likely to be saved and accounted for whenever the users next get online. But so far not much is known specifically about the settlement mechanism.

Familiar features such as transfer by account number as well as generation and scanning of QR codes can already be seen on screens.

The BSN payment system can process up to 300,000 transactions per second.

The Chinese cryptocurrency is suitable for any financial operations because of its high throughput, including traditional retail transactions and even micropayments.

Obviously, the crypto yuan blockchain will be centralized.

Interestingly, the currency will not only work on the blockchain — it will be issued in two main stages: from the Central Bank to commercial banks, and from commercial banks it will already be put into circulation.

Banks and organizations will be able to act as DC/EP issuers who can exchange the digital yuan with other fiat currencies and assets.

Patents also indicate that DC/EP will use a two-tier architecture that allows licensed third-party payment institutions and banks to participate in the secondary issuance of digital currency.

It appears that Alipay itself will participate in the implementation of this scheme.

All organizations licensed to participate in the DC/EP issue will have a reserve account with the People's Bank of China.

China also sees its own cryptocurrency as a means of counteracting new digital currencies. According to the Central Bank, a domestically issued digital currency, supported by the government and expressed in the national unit of account, can help limit the issue of private currencies and reduce the risks of financial instability.

According to China's plan, the crypto yuan will significantly expand financial infrastructure availability in the country. At the same time, as an international means of exchange, it could improve the efficiency of cross-border payments.

Many sources say that on March 24, the Bank of China completed the development of basic functions and began drafting laws to implement the new technology nationwide.

One of the main challenges for the Government is to ensure that the crypto yuan enjoys the same sovereignty as the fiat yuan. Strong liquidity guarantees are promised to its holders.

The central bank said that DC/EP is also planned to be widely used during the 2022 Olympic Games to be held in Beijing.

Is this the beginning of a new financial era?

As can be seen from the information currently available, DC/EP is not the classic concept of a decentralized cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. The users themselves are unlikely to feel a significant difference in using the new system compared to WeChat Pay or AliPay. For the government, the blockchain data structure will ensure unprecedented traceability and control.

It is important to note the advantage China can gain by being the first to release a government backed digital currency at scale. Meanwhile, competing projects like Libra and Ton have been held back and forced to change by regulators.

Today, China is the second economy in the world and the least dependent on oil prices. While there’s no doubt that the dollar reigns supreme today, the digital yuan is China’s best chance to compete with the dollar on the global scale in the years ahead.

There is no doubt that other governments will quickly follow China’s example. Perhaps we are entering a new era — the end of physical cash and the emergence of central bank cryptocurrencies. And there is a strong possibility that this will completely change the international monetary system as we know it.

Bitcoin went through a 6.23% price hike over the past seven days of trading as the cryptocurrency managed to push to a fresh April high at $7,700. The coin met resistance at $7,200 last week, which caused it to drop beneath $7,000 at the start of this week. It went on to find support at $6,800, where it rebounded.

On the rebound, Bitcoin took out resistance at $7,000, $7,200, and $7,400 as it spiked as high as $7,780. It since dropped to the current $7,500 level, where it faces resistance at the 100-days EMA.

Looking ahead, if the buyers break above the 100-days EMA, the first level of resistance lies at $7,700. Above this, resistance lies at $7,780 (1.272 Fib Extension), $7,880 (200-days EMA), and $8,000 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement). This is followed by resistance at $8,300 (1.618 Fib Extension).

If the bears push lower, support can be found at $7,400, $7,200, and $7,000. Beneath this, added support lies at $6,800 and $6,640.

Ethereum

Ethereum saw a 10% price increase this week as it manages to reach the resistance at $188 again.

The cryptocurrency was trading at this level 7 days ago, but the resistance here, provided by a bearish .5 Fib Retracement, caused ETH to drop lower into the support at $170, where lies the 100-days EMA.

ETH rebounded from this level and since returned to the $188 resistance. It actually spiked upward to create a fresh April 2020 high at $194 yesterday.

If the bulls break $188, resistance is expected at $194 and $200. Above this, added resistance lies at $206, $211 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement), and $225.

Toward the downside, support lies at $177 (200-days EMA), $175, and $170 (100-days EMA). This is followed by support at $165 and $160.

Against Bitcoin, Ethereum met resistance at the 0.026 BTC level last week, which caused it to drop into the 0.025 BTC level during the week. It attempted to rebound from here but was halted by 0.026 BTC again yesterday. The coin has since dropped into the support at 0.247 BTC.

If the sellers break 0.0247 BTC, the first level of support lies at 0.0239 BTC. Beneath this, support lies at 0.023 BTC (.5 Fib Retracement) and 0.0225 BTC (100-days EMA).

On the other side, if the bulls can break 0.025 BTC, resistance lies at 0.026 BTC (bearish .786 Fib Retracement), 0.0263 BTC, and 0.0266 BTC (bearish .886 Fib Retracement).

Ripple

XRP saw a small 3% price increase this past week as it continues to remain trapped at the $0.20 resistance. It reached $0.0196 last Friday, which caused it to drop lower into support at $0.18 (short term .236 Fib Retracement & rising trend line).

XRP rebounded from here and started to climb higher as it breaks back above $0.19 to reach $0.195. XRP will need to cleanly break the $0.20 resistance for a bull run to be sparked.

Looking ahead, the first level of resistance is located at $0.20. Above this, resistance lies at $0.207 (100-days EMA), $0.217, and $0.224. Following this, added resistance lies at $0.23 (200-days EMA).

Toward the downside, support lies at $0.191, the rising trend line, and $0.18. Beneath this, added support lies at $0.171 and $0.165 (.382 Fib Retracement).

Against Bitcoin, XRP was trading at the 2710 SAT resistance last Friday as it continued to trade beneath a falling trend line. The coin made multiple attempts to break above this trend line this week but failed on each one.

In yesterday’s trading session, XRP fell further beneath this trend line as it broke the support at 2650 SAT and dropped as low as 2570 SAT.

Moving forward, if the sellers push lower, the first level of support lies at 2560 SAT (.618 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, support lies at 2525 SAT, 2500 SAT, and 2470 SAT (.786 Fib Retracement).

On the other hand, the first level of resistance lies at 2600 SAT. Above this, resistance lies at 2650 SAT, the falling trend line, and 2670 SAT. Added resistance is located at 2710 SAT and 2750 SAT.

Tezos

Tezos saw a very strong 27.5% price increase over the past 7-days of trading as the cryptocurrency surges to reach $2.70.

The coin began the week by meeting resistance at $2.34, which caused it trouble as it rolled over to reach $2.10. From here, the coin rebounded and went on to break the aforementioned resistance and continued to surge. It broke above $2.50 to reach the current resistance level at $2.70, provided by a 1.414 Fib Extension.

Looking ahead, if the buyers break $2.70, the first level of resistance lies at $2.82 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement). Above this, resistance is located at $3.00, $3.14, and $3.31 (bearish .786 Fib Retracement & March 2020 high).

Toward the downside, the first level of support lies at $2.58. Beneath this, support lies at $2.50, $2.34, $2.20, and $2.00 (100-days EMA).

Against Bitcoin, Tezos also went on a rampage this week as it reaches a high of 0.000362 BTC, which is resistance provided by 1.414 FIb Extension level. It started the week by rebounding from the support at 0.0003 BTC as it went on to break resistance at 0.00032 BTC and 0.00034 BTC.

If the bulls continue to drive above 0.000362 BTC, resistance is expected at 0.00037 BTC (bearish .786 Fib Retracement). Above this, resistance lies at 0.00038 BTC (1.618 Fib Extension), 0.000387 BTC, and 0.0004 BTC.

On the other side, support lies at 0.00034 BTC, 0.00032 BTC, and 0.0003 BTC.

Cardano

Cardano also witnessed a fantastic price surge this week as it increased by 24% to reach the 200-days EMA at around $0.042. The coin started the week by breaking above the $0.035 level and continued higher to break the previous April high at $0.0367.

It went on to break resistance at $0.038 (bearish .382 Fib Retracement) to reach the 200-days EMA where it currently trades.

Looking ahead, once the bulls break the 200-days EMA, resistance is located at $0.0446 (bearish .5 Fib Retracement). Above this, resistance lies at $0.047, $0.049 (1.618 FIb Extension), and $0.05 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement).

If the sellers push lower, support can be expected at $0.04, $0.0383 (100-days EMA), and $0.0367. Beneath this, additional support lies at $0.035.

Cardano has also been surging against Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency began the week trading at 500 SAT as it started to climb higher. It broke above the 100-days EMA and resistance at the 200-days EMA at around 550 SAT to reach the current trading level at 570 SAT.

It spiked higher today to break above the March 2020 high of 573 SAT as it reached the 585 SAT level.

Looking ahead, if the buyers continue above 570 SAT, resistance is located at 580 SAT and 600 SAT (bearish .618 Fib retracement). Above this, resistance lies at 620 SAT (1.414 Fib Extension) and 640 SAT (bearish .786 Fib Retracement).

Alternatively, if the sellers push lower, support lies at 550 SAT (200-days EMA), 535 SAT, and 520 SAT. This is followed by support at 510 SAT (100-days EMA) and 500 SAT.","BitMEX, a leading crypto futures exchange, announced its new ETH/USD futures contracts which will be up for trading from May 5.

Though the new derivatives contract will allow traders to bet on ETH prices against USD, the settlement will be done in Bitcoin.

“ETHUSD quanto futures have a fixed Bitcoin multiplier regardless of the USD Ethereum price,” the official announcement stated. This allows traders to long or short the ETH/USD exchange rate without ever touching either ETH or USD! Traders post margin in XBT, and earn or lose Bitcoin as the ETH/USD rate changes.”

The contracts will have a Bitcoin multiplier of 0.000001 XBT, meaning for every $1 move in the ETH prices, the trader will receive 0.000001 bitcoin regardless of the USD price of ETH.

The new futures contract will offer leverage up to 50x to the traders and will expire quarterly. The first ETHUSD contract (ETHUSD20) will expire in June.

“This contract combines the quanto feature of our ETHUSD perpetual swap with the expiry and settlement found in traditional futures. As with every BitMEX altcoin future, it expires quarterly,” the exchange noted.

Earlier this year, BitMEX also expanded its offering by introducing XRP perpetual contracts.

Raising demand for derivatives

BitMEX is one of the biggest derivatives exchanges, handling billions in trades every day. However, it recently lost its apex market position to Binance’s months-old futures platform.

Notably, the Seychelles-registered exchange saw a record liquidation since the recent crypto market dip which echoed the Coronavirus plunge of the stock market.

Meanwhile, BitMEX is one of the few major exchanges which is recently named in 11 class action lawsuits filed at a New York court.","Since Thursday’s jolt in bitcoin prices, the cryptocurrency has traded in a tight range close to the $7,500 level. It has not only come back from the losses suffered in March, it’s also showing some upward momentum.

The price for one BTC is currently above 10-day and 50-moving averages on the daily charts, a bullish technical signal. “Despite the mid-March 2020 bitcoin sell-off when we saw a close to 50 percent drop, it has now, within a month, recovered 95 percent,” said Antoni Trenchev co-founder of crypto lender Nexo.

Thursday’s jump in bitcoin price, briefly as high as $7,800 on some spot exchanges, hurt short sellers in the crypto derivatives market. Those trades betting on crypto prices going downward have not returned to derivatives exchanges like BitMEX, said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of exchange platform Alpha5.

“What we saw yesterday was a collapse in open interest, and no real premium being built into the futures curve,” he told CoinDesk. As short sellers were wiped out on BitMEX Thursday during the bitcoin price spike, open interest dropped and it hasn’t recovered.

“It’s tough for me to digest that there’s new capital funneling in; it’s likely capital within the ecosystem sloshing around and targeting pain points,” Shah added. “It feels pretty firm, with the next battle trench likely in the $7,850 – $8,000 region.”

Inflows are needed to push crypto prices higher. Bitcoin’s year-to-date high was $10,510 on spot exchanges like Coinbase back on Feb. 13 and more capital into crypto will be needed to push the markets higher.

“Demand continues to be steady. You have to remember that for bitcoin to stay at these levels, you need inflows of new dollars matching supply of new coins,” said Daniel Masters, chairman of U.K.-based asset manager CoinShares.

That being said, Masters anticipates most investors holding rather than selling ahead of the bitcoin halving in mid-May – with the exception of miners, who need cash to pay for operational expenditures like energy costs and data center leases.

“Analysis of wallets shows most tourists and speculators have sold, meaning we don’t expect many folks to sell into the halving except for miners who may be anticipating some pain around and are trying to lock in opex costs,” said Masters.

China’s economy is the second-largest in the world and economists believe the country may someday bring a new global order and end the Western hemisphere’s financial rule. In 2020, various reports show that China’s central bank will soon release a cryptocurrency that represents a digital yuan. This week, regional reports show that 19 well known restaurants including Starbucks, Subway, and McDonald’s will be testing the bank’s virtual currency.

China’s Digital Yuan Is Becoming a Reality

Reports this week detail that the People’s Bank of China is making headway with its digital yuan testing. Rumors of China creating a digital yuan or a central bank digital currency (CBDC) have been happening since 2013. Four days ago, the PBoC confirmed the existence of a CBDC after a number of photos went viral on social media. The PBoC made a statement about the screenshots and explained that the bank was testing. “The rumored information on the internet is part of the test in our research and development process and it does not mean the digital yuan has been launched officially,” the PBoC said.

Now regional reports indicate that 19 popular restaurants and retail establishments will be testing the digital yuan. The financial news columnist noted that Tencent and Ant Financial participated as well as JD Supermarkets, Starbucks, Subway, and McDonald’s. Various Chinese lawmakers are experimenting with the test and there is testing happening in Suzhou and the country’s Xiong’An new district. In Suzhou, it is rumored that Chinese government employees may soon be paid using the PBoC’s CBDC.

Martin Jacques Novel ‘When China Rules the World’ Predicts the Rise of the East and the End of the West

With the petro-dollar on its last leg, many economists think that China will be the world’s economic superpower with very little peers. Market strategists think Russia will be involved with China’s rise as both countries have been participating in backroom deals to trade oil for other currencies and commodities. Moreover, economists believe the digital yuan will be an integral part of China’s role in developing economic superiority. British journalist and scholar Martin Jacques believes that “China’s future economic strength will heavily alter the political and cultural landscape of the future world.” The digital yuan will be called the “DC/EP” which stands for “Digital Currency Electronic Payment.”

“Today, China is the second economy in the world and the least dependent on oil prices,” explains the columnist Sergey Baloyan “While there’s no doubt that the dollar reigns supreme today, the digital yuan is China’s best chance to compete with the dollar on the global scale in the years ahead.”

What do you think about China’s DC/EP? Let us know in the comments below.

Markets were shocked when the May futures contract on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the main oil benchmark for the U.S., crashed Monday on fears arising from massive oversupply due to the effects of the coronavirus measures.

A day later, the June contract tumbled more than 43 percent to a 21-year low of $11.57 a barrel. Bitcoin, though, barely flinched and held within its recent trading range between $6,400 and $7,400.

But, according to data from CryptoCompare, bitcoin has outshone oil for far longer than just a few days when it comes price stability. In fact, “black gold” first started showing greater volatility – that is, the degree of fluctuation in the price of an asset – in early March, and has largely remained higher in April.

CryptoCompare graphed 14-day rolling volatilities for oil, bitcoin, gold and the S&P 500. A volatility above 5 percent for 14 days translates to 25 percent or more on an annualized basis.

“The more volatile, the bigger the percentage move, the riskier the asset (regardless of the direction),” the firm told CoinDesk in an email.

14-Days Rolling Volatility for Oil, S&P 500, Bitcoin and Gold Source: CryptoCompare

While bitcoin was the “riskiest” – most volatile – asset of the four contenders at the start of the year, in early March, oil surged to levels above 0.10, and even as high as 0.15 later in the month.

“As the year progressed, the disagreement between OPEC and Russia, coupled with negative demand shock caused the oil price to collapse, making it riskier than bitcoin,” said James Li, analyst at CryptoCompare.

Bitcoin’s volatility surge came soon after and is likely associated with the “Black Thursday” crash on March 12, which saw the cryptocurrency plunge to as low as $3,867 as all markets suffered from coronavirus-related shocks.

While both assets have since seen volatility drop, it doesn’t appear oil’s price gyrations have come to an end yet.

“Without any significant catalysts for demand, there’s nowhere to put oil,” said Daniel Masters, chairman of CoinShares, a U.K.-based digital asset management firm. Continued problems with the oil futures market could be on the horizon because of there’s a shortage facilities for oil, according to Masters. “The worst isn’t over yet, the May contract just got rolled into June this week, and when June contracts expire, it will be absolute carnage.”

The June WTI contract is currently trading at about $16.60.

So what’s the safe haven in the storm of volatility? Gold is the least volatile of the four assets compared, according to the chart, never crossing 0.05. CryptoCompare’s Li is concerned even cash may prove inflationary given the massive stimulus efforts so far. And it appears more is on the way in the U.S. after the Senate passed another stimulus bill later approved by the House of Representatives. If signed by President Trump, it will pump billions of dollars more into the economy."
2020-04-25,"The number of Bitcoin addresses that hold at least 0.1 BTC (appr. $750 at time of writing) has surpassed the 3-million mark for the very first time, as cryptocurrency investors get ready for the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, when the pseudonymous digital asset’s supply will be reduced by 50%.

Some crypto analysts argue that the BTC halving has been “priced in” already, and that it will not impact the digital currency’s price (significantly). But others point out that crypto and broader financial markets are often irrational and that the market dynamics are more accurately described by behavioral economics, which was inspired by Danny Kahneman, a psychologist by profession, who notably received a Nobel Prize in economics for his valuable contributions.

Despite the crypto market crash on March 12 – March 13, 2020, which saw BTC price drop by over 50%, the number of digital currency addresses holding at least 0.1 Bitcoin continues to increase.

It can be argued that this trend reflects a growth in Bitcoin adoption.

Despite the economic uncertainty created by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the number of Bitcoin ATMs also recorded their highest-ever growth rate last month (worldwide). ATM locations in the United States have surpassed 5,000, which presently accounts for 71% of the global Bitcoin ATM market.

Bitcoin ATM’s are physical locations where people can exchange cash for BTC, Litecoin (LTC), and other cryptos, and vice versa — selling BTC or LTC for fiat money. Although most Bitcoin ATM service providers only have physical locations (like at supermarkets, convenience stores), some are now providing digital or online services as well.

Bitcoin ATM and exchange companies, such as Bitcoin of America, are reportedly offering cash-settled services at their ATM and over the counter cash-to-bitcoin locations across the US.

Bitcoin for America also has a digital wire transfer gateway for buying larger amounts of Bitcoins. The company is a registered Money Services Business (MSB). It offers fraud prevention for purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies.","Ebang International, one of the world’s largest bitcoin mining machines manufacturers, has just formally filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S.

Ebang is looking to raise up to $100 million through the offering, according to an F-1 form filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday. The company looks to offload Class A ordinary shares, having a face value of HK$0.001 (US$ 0.00013) per share.

China-based Ebang intends to list its shares either on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq Global Market, under the symbol “EBON,” per the form F-1.



Hong Kong-based AMTD Global Markets Limited and U.S.-based Loop Capital Markets LLC are listed as joint underwriters for Ebang's IPO.



Ebang is one of the leading ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips designers and made 82% of its 2019 revenue on designing these chips for bitcoin mining.



Ebang's revenues, however, fell sharply last year to $109 million as compared to $319 million in 2018. The company had a gross loss of $30.6 million in 2019 as compared to a gross profit of $24.4 million in 2018.





Source: Form F-1

Revenue split



Ebang, the Ebit bitcoin miner maker, had most of its 2019 revenues (over 53%) from selling Ebit E12 Series machines, followed by Ebit E10 Series machines (34%).







It is worth noting that the number of chips and the average price at which Ebang sold its chips, both declined in 2019 as compared to the previous year. In 2018, Ebang sold 415,930 mining chips for the average price of $737, while in 2019 it sold 289,953 chips at an average price of only $304.



“The decrease in the Bitcoin price in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 resulted in a material decrease in our sales volume and in the average selling price of our Bitcoin mining machines. Although the Bitcoin price started to recover in the second quarter of 2019, our operations generally lag behind the increase of Bitcoin price, and we recorded a revenue of US$109.1 million in 2019,” said Ebang.

Risk factors

Ebang said its operations significantly depend on bitcoin's price. “Our results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be significantly impacted by the fluctuation of Bitcoin price, and in particular, significantly and negatively impacted by the sharp Bitcoin price decrease,"" said the company, adding:

""The price of Bitcoin tends to have a direct impact on the market demand for our Bitcoin mining machines, in terms of both the price and the quantity, and we expect this trend to continue.”



The coronavirus pandemic has ""adversely affected"" the bitcoin price, according to Ebang, and the lower prices ""may continue in the near term and adversely affect our business of operations and financial condition.""

“We and our customers have experienced significant business disruptions and suspension of operations due to quarantine measures to contain the spread of the pandemic, which may cause shortage in the supply of raw materials, reduce our production capacity, increase the likelihood of default from our customers and delay our product delivery,” Ebang added.

Second attempt

This is Ebang's second attempt to go public. In June 2018, the company filed for an IPO in Hong Kong, but it failed to take off. At the time, Ebang was reportedly looking to raise as much as $1 billion.



Friday's filing confirms recent reports, which said Ebang is looking to go for a U.S. IPO. But the targeted raise amount is sharply down.



Ebang rival Canaan Creative, also based in China, went public in the U.S. last year. It raised $90 million (compared to a targeted amount of $400 million) by listing its shares on Nasdaq in November. But Canaan's shares have taken a beating and are down by around 53% since its listing.

Paolo Ardoino, who is also the CTO of Tether’s sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, told CoinDesk this is part of the reason he has been working with the team behind the token wrapper project, pTokens, to develop an interoperability bridge between the Bitcoin and EOS networks.

Launching Friday, the company will initially support a bitcoin wrapper on the EOS mainnet – pBTC. Essentially, a user will be able to deposit funds in one network, say Bitcoin, and pToken will issue the user the equivalent amount of “wrapped” tokens on the new network. The company hopes to support a bridge between litecoin and EOS, as well as EOS and ethereum.

An EOS wrapper for a tether ERC20 token is currently being planned, according to pTokens’ website. Founder Thomas Bertani told CoinDesk there were no plans yet to consider developing an EOS wrapper for tether on Omni, a secondary layer on top of the Bitcoin protocol.

See also: Tether CTO Claims USDT Stablecoin Can Boost DeFi Liquidity

A key benefit of interoperability is users can better leverage the different characteristics of different blockchains, Ardoino said. One of the initial reasons Tether created an ERC20 version in 2017 was so it could sidestep the congested Bitcoin network.

“Omni was costing a lot of money, up to $500, Ethereum wasn’t so saturated, so the fees were cheap. Every trader would have preferred to move the funds onto the Ethereum blockchain because it was cheaper and faster,” Ardoino said.

Ethereum speeds slowed due to network congestion by the end of 2017, however. Creating an interoperability bridge between it and EOS – which has higher throughput and much less chain activity – essentially provides users with a “backup” option, so they can continue to trade with minimal fees and quick settlement times, he claimed.

Many crypto exchanges, including Bitfinex, already offer users two different types of tether, so the ability to swap between protocols already exists in some form. However, interoperability bridges make it easier for users themselves to move between the different protocols.

Ardoino foresees Bitfinex and Tether will continue to perform chain swaps. Major exchanges looking to swap $10 million worth of tether between two chains will always be able to organize it with them directly, he said.

But, he added, greater interoperability will allow retail investors with smaller amounts of tether to also shift freely between the different blockchains.

The global crisis and financial market turmoil have many investors looking into whether cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, are a good investment for them. A Japanese analyst has predicted high institutional investor demand for bitcoin post coronavirus crisis, giving three key reasons why the cryptocurrency is an attractive investment.

High Institutional Demand Expected Post Coronavirus Crisis

The covid-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented economic crisis, with the IMF calling it the worst recession since the Great Depression. Companies are missing their earnings estimates and many traditional investments have taken a hit across the board. The crisis has investors scrambling to find safe haven assets, and more people are now asking whether cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, are a good investment.

Bitcoin Lab CEO Tetsuyuki Oishi, a guest crypto analyst at Japanese financial company Fisco, shared three reasons earlier this week why he sees considerable demand from institutional investors for cryptocurrencies post the pandemic.

Firstly, he said that the stock market may lose its attractiveness after the coronavirus crisis due to decreased demand for many companies’ products, resulting in long-term declines in corporate profits. He elaborated:

Most consensus is that a V-shaped recovery of stock prices is difficult. Therefore, investors need to seek out investment options other than stocks. Investors can’t just put everything in cash.

Next, the analyst asserted that cryptocurrencies are attractive because there is still very little correlation between them and traditional investments. He explained: “During the plunge, of course, all assets were sold, both gold and bitcoins were sold, but they picked up thereafter … As a result, there is more room to incorporate assets that will have little correlation with the uncertain future society.”

Another reason why investors will be more interested in cryptocurrencies compared to other asset types is that “among such uncorrelated assets, the one most investors have not yet incorporated [into their portfolios] is cryptocurrency, especially BTC,” Oishi opined.

Regarding the level of interest for cryptocurrencies, the analyst cited Grayscale Investments’ Q1 2020 earnings report showing capital inflows totaling $503.7 million into cryptocurrency investment products. “This is the largest scale ever,” he wrote, adding that $388.9 million went into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust for BTC. Furthermore, 88% of all investments made in the quarter were by institutional investors. Oishi added, “It is good news that investors’ interest in virtual currencies has not declined,” concluding that interest from institutional investors is expected to continue after the coronavirus crisis.

Financial Experts Recommend Bitcoin in Portfolios

Before the spread of coronavirus and subsequent economic turmoil, financial experts were already recommending some exposure to cryptocurrencies within investment portfolios.

JPMorgan, for example, wrote in a February report that “The crypto market continues to mature, and cryptocurrency trading participation by institutional investors is now significant.” Predicting that “Bonds may lose their ability to hedge equity portfolios over the next several years,” the firm suggested that “less-constrained markets like the yen and gold should form part of long-term hedges,” elaborating:

Cryptocurrencies should be added to this list too … because they can uniquely hedge a yet-unseen environment entailing simultaneous loss of confidence in the domestic currency and its payments system.

Furthermore, various finance experts have recommended putting bitcoin in investment portfolios. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has repeatedly said that the dollar is dead and people should invest their stimulus money in bitcoin. Virgin Galactic chairman Chamath Palihapitiya has long vouched for allocating at least 1% of portfolios in bitcoin. In addition, Galaxy Digital chairman Mike Novogratz pointed out that with all the money printing central banks are doing, it is prime time to buy bitcoin.

Ruben Waterman, the company’s founder, said that newly-enforced financial regulations were the main reason why Bittr decided to shut down its services.

The AMLD5 became effective July 9, 2018, and required the EU bloc’s 28 member nations to transpose its regulatory requirements into local laws before January 2020.

AMLD5 or the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive is an update made to the EU’s anti-money laundering (AML) regulatory guidelines. It was first proposed on June 19, 2018 in the Official Journal of the European Union as an iteration of the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD4).

AMLD5 has been followed (in November 2018) by the 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD6), which is mainly a revision of AMLD4, and must be transposed by the EU member nations by early December 2020.

AMLD5 has put a lot of pressure on cryptocurrency-related companies, especially those service providers that custody clients’ digital assets funds. Blockchain and crypto asset firms (just like all other businesses) are being asked by authorities to follow anti-money laundering/know-your-customer (AML/KYC) checks and guidelines.

Due to increased regulatory pressure and stricter requirements, peer to peer Bitcoin marketplace Paxful recently raised its transaction processing (escrow) fees from 1% to 2%.

Bittr claims that the potential cost and impact on its existing customer base was too much for it to handle.

Waterman wrote in a company blog post:

“Due to upcoming regulatory changes in The Netherlands (where Bittr is based) I will have to shut down the Bittr service on April 28, 2020 09:59 UTC. A small chance exists I will have to shut down the service even before this moment if the new regulations get published in the ‘government gazette’ before this time. New sign-ups and the sell bitcoin page are already disabled.”

Waterman mentioned in the blog post that the tightening of financial surveillance rules and checks (related toAMLD5) would have required his small firm to work with a compliance professional and develop new AML policies and guidelines.

He claims that adhering to the updated EU-wide regulations would have required the firm to spend a substantial amount of money, which may not have been feasible.

Bittr confirmed that it’s still letting customer sell fiat currency for BTC, however, Waterman cautioned that the firm might have to shut down its service before users’ funds arrive at their company bank account.

The company founder added:","The Binance-owned crypto derivatives exchange, FTX, has introduced oil futures following the recent record crash in U.S. oil prices — which fell as low as minus-$40 on April 20.

FTX’s contracts will expire at the spot price of West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, plus $100 to protect against negative settlement prices.

The exchange notes that should the spot price of oil fall below minus-$100, “FTX OIL contracts “can theoretically expire negative.”

FTX launches crypto-based oil contract trading

FTX comprises a top-10 ranked Bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange by both volume and open interest. The Binance-owned exchange is the largest to offer crypto-based oil contract trading.

The contracts are not available to account-holders residing in or with an IP address in the United States, Canada, or a number of other verboten locations.

Oil’s volatility dwarfs cryptocurrencies

Despite being known for their volatility, cryptocurrencies have paled in comparison to the price swings posted by WTI since March.

The contracts will trade until settlement, even if they are settled after the expiration date has expired.

Derivative volumes spike in 2020

The first quarter of 2020 saw record trade volume posted by the crypto derivatives sector, driven by new market entrants, Binance and FTX.

A report published by CryptoCompare earlier this month estimated that the combined market share of Binance and FTX grew from 14% in January to 22% in March amid the dramatic crypto market crash.

Binance saw the largest volume among derivatives exchanges, with $2.8 billion in futures contracts changing hands during the violent sell-off.","It’s been a good week for Bitcoin. After languishing at around $6,700, the cryptocoin is up more than 6 percent over the last week to take it above $7,000. And the next halving is now less than three weeks away.

Changpeng Zhao is looking further ahead. He predicts that in a few months, as governments implement quantitative easing measures to stabilize coronavirus-hit economies, Bitcoin will rise. “Mathematics works, he told BlockDown 2020, a two-day virtual conference. “If you increase supply of the fiat currency and Bitcoin is a limited asset, mathematics will eventually work.” For crypto-ATM services like DigitalMint and LibertyX, that’s good news. They’ve been expanding their spread of Bitcoin cash machines. The movement of digital coins certainly looks better than that of oil. As a barrel of crude fell into negative territory for the first time, Bitcoin barely moved.

Not all the old stuff being dug up is worthless though. A 21-year-old post on the Cypherpunks mailing list has led to speculation that it was written by a young Satoshi Nakamoto. The post describes a form of e-cash, and mentions many of the issues that came to define Bitcoin.

There may be good news for anyone who lost money on their crypto trades this year. It’s complicated stuff but IRS virus relief might now mean that it’s easier to offset losses. And the virus could create new blockchain opportunities in its birthplace. A report on the response of China’s blockchain industry to COVID-19 suggests that monetary policies will push people towards digital coins.

In the US, a federal judge has issued warrants for the arrest of David Schmidt and Robert Dunlap. Schmidt is a former Republican state senator in Washington. He and Dunlop are alleged to have sold Meta 1 tokens that they claimed were backed by $1 billion in fine art or $2 billion of gold. The SEC froze the cryptocurrency’s assets and charged the firm’s operators with fraud on the grounds that there were no tokens. The defendants, together with Nicole Bowdler, who claims to be “an Earth Angel” in touch with the angel Metatron, were charged with fraud.

Libra is hoping that the government will be more lenient towards its plans. The association has revised its white paper in an attempt to meet the demands of US regulators. At least two members of the House Financial Services Committee are not impressed. Outside the US, Facebook remains bullish on its digital coin. It’s looking for 50 new workers to add to its team of 5,000 to work on Calibra.

In Japan, one of the country’s largest advertising companies is planning to use the blockchain to reward people who comment on manga, even though those comments may include copyrighted material. And in Malaysia, police have arrested fourteen Chinese men for their involvement in an alleged Bitcoin scam. The men are said to have impersonated wealthy investors.

And finally, some good news. Enterprise blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, is bringing trust to difficult but vital markets, like aerospace parts. A survey has found that it’s not all drugs on the crypto markets. Fifteen percent of digital spending goes on clothes and 14 percent is spent on food.

Malta’s futuristic design to be the “Blockchain Island” has suffered a setback as 70% of companies in the sector have not sought licensing. Six months after the deadline, only 26 companies have applied for licensing and none has been granted one.

Malta initiated legislation to regulate virtual financial assets in 2018 and invited companies to operate on the island during the transitory phase, after which they were supposed to register. Six months after the deadline, 57 of the 83 companies which responded to the call have not applied for licensing.

The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) has received 26 applications which it is still reviewing and has yet to issue any license. On Friday, however, the financial regulator published a list of 57 companies that have not sought licensing six months after the deadline, despite its multiple reminders to them since November 2019.

In a statement, the MFSA said it is aware of a number of entities that have “failed to submit either a letter of intent to initiate the application process for a VFA [virtual financial asset] services license or a cessation of activities notification.” The financial regulator warned customers that doing business with unregulated firms constitutes a risk to the investors.

The MFSA regulates cryptocurrency exchanges, initial coin offerings, and wallet providers under the Virtual Financial Services Act (VFSA).

Companies that publicly supported Malta’s crypto legislation, such as Binance and Palladium, have also not sought licensing. Binance was the face of the campaign while Palladium appeared alongside then Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to launch the first ever “initial convertible coin offering.”

Aversion to regulation is an essential blockchain attribute, although it cannot account for the non-complying companies’ initial enthusiasm to be covered by Maltese legislation. Reports that entities found the VFSA requirements too demanding may explain why only 30% of them are still backing the “Blockchain Island” dream.

The Estonian licenses that were issued up until the beginning of 2019 have proved to be the easiest license to comply with, and have served thousands of licenses in Estonia.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

Yet, recently the tide has shifted in the Baltics, and especially in Estonia. 5 AMLD that was supposed to be fully implemented by January 2020 in all Member States in the European Union has taken a very heavy toll on the local regulators. Member States that will be deemed non-compliant will have to 5 AMLD will be held in breach of EU Law, which will result in proceedings against the EU Commission in front of the CJEU.

Certain Member States have already been issued warnings by the EU Commission, such as the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Cyprus. Estonia clearly does not want to appear in such a star-studded list, which have left local regulators with severe consequences.

Hence, it was inevitable that Estonia, with the vast amount of crypto exchange licenses that were issued, will take the lead in amending their crypto regulations and guidelines in that regard.

The purpose of the new framework stems from the 5th AML Directive implementation in each Member State, which has completely changed the EU to an indistinguishably new Market that is facing unchartered waters, specifically within the realm of AML. Crypto Exchanges operating and licensed in Estonia are encouraged to adapt to the new framework or risk revocation of their license.

Crypto exchanges that have obtained the license prior to the new conditions will not only have to comply to the new conditions such as local AML officer, local director, physical presence and raise in the share capital but in certain will also have to expect an invitation to the FIU for further clarifications. The list above is non- exhaustive, and the FIU is able to ask for additional documentation and proof of integration to the Estonian market.

It seems that the era of smoother and wrinkle-free licenses in the EU has ended, and the era of heavier regulation has embanked on the shores not only of the continent but also on the realm of the FATF. Banking renaissance, like any sort of renaissance, encompasses many challenges for the spearheading individuals and companies, such as cryptocurrency exchanges. What will remain is not only a question to the regulator but to the companies as well, that will now have to learn to collaborate better with the Member State Regulators.

2020-04-26,"Dan Morehead, chief executive of crypto investment firm and hedge fund Pantera Capital, says leading digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and XRP will challenge the supremacy of the US dollar in the long run.

In the latest episode of Real Vision Finance with macro investor Raoul Pal, Morehead describes the current economic backdrop that he believes may spell the beginning of the end of US dollar dominance.

“In the fiscal policy, we’ve seen a 10% of GDP stimulus signed days before a new stimulus plan has been talked about. These are just numbers that are literally off the charts. I think it is almost certain that the United States is going to exit this crisis with more debt than after the battle against the Great Depression or World War II.”

Morehead points out that the change from the dollar to a new reserve currency will happen over the course of many years.

“It’s a fact of the world that the dollar is the reserve currency right now. That’s changed every 80 or hundred years over the last six centuries…

I do think in the long run, and this is decades, cryptocurrencies will become reserve currencies, whether it’s Bitcoin or Ethereum or Ripple. Ultimately, some of those will be reserve currencies but governments are very slow to change and so I think that’s a 10 to 20-year, very slow progression.”

When asked which cryptocurrencies have staying power, the crypto investment firm executive says that only a handful of tokens will make the cut.

“I think there’s going to be a single-digit of very important blockchains…

It’s already starting to shape up where you’re seeing Bitcoin not really changed very much but being really good at storing wealth… You see Ethereum be really dynamic, and they’ve already got Ethereum 2.0… Then Ripple’s taken an enterprise SaaS version of this and trying to work with all the banks… I think there’s space for eight to 10 of those use cases in the long, long run.”

Morehead also expects a resurgence in crypto after institutional investors assess the damage and see that the current economic crisis brings new opportunities.

As for the current crypto strategy at Pantera, Morehead says the firm has temporarily sold a significant portion of its altcoin holdings for the short term, expecting Bitcoin to lead a comeback within a year.

“The only conclusion we can come to for cryptocurrency is that in the six to nine-month time frame it’s going to be very positive.”

Featured Image: Shutterstock/viktorov.pro","Over the past decade, the machines that maintain the Bitcoin network have undergone rapid technological development.

Mining equipment is a fundamental feature of the success of the bitcoin network because these machines determine whether or not it is profitable for miners to do what they do – that is, process the calculations needed to embed blocks of transactions on the blockchain.

While somewhat overlooked, the history of bitcoin mining equipment is also a key explanation for why the activity of mining has evolved over the years into a multi-billion dollar industry. The mining industry continues to evolve today, though there are signs to suggest its development is slowing down.

Below we take a look at the complete history of bitcoin mining technology, and where innovations could be heading next.

CPU Mining

On Jan. 3, 2009, pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first bitcoin block. As the only miner on the bitcoin network at the time, Nakamoto didn’t need specialized equipment to launch the bitcoin blockchain. He was able to create bitcoin blocks using an average personal computer.

Computers used to browse the internet, launch Microsoft Word and a number of other countless applications all contain what is called a central processing unit (CPU). These devices control how commands on a computer are processed and executed. Due to the lack of miner competition in bitcoin’s early days, the computational energy required to create new blocks and earn mining rewards could be easily processed on CPU devices.

Hardware needed to mine new coins evolved over time as new miners joined the Bitcoin network and started to compete for block rewards.

GPU and FPGA Mining

The first major innovation to bitcoin mining hardware came shortly after a market value for bitcoin was established.

On May 22, 2010, computer programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas. The pizzas were worth around $25. According to cryptocurrency data provider Coin Metrics, bitcoin market price then appreciated in July to around 8 cents. By the time the bitcoin price reached 10 cents in October 2010, the first mining device leveraging graphics processing units (GPUs) was developed.

Unlike CPUs, GPU devices are optimized to perform a narrow range of computational tasks. Originally built for gaming applications, GPUs excel at computing simple mathematical operations in parallel, rather than one at a time, in order to generate thousands of time-sensitive image pixels. These devices can also be re-programmed to compute other mathematical operations such as the ones required to mine new bitcoin.

The innovation of GPU mining, that is mining bitcoin on a GPU device, made producing bitcoin blocks and earning block rewards on average roughly six times more efficient according to analysis done by CEO of mining consultancy firm Navier, Josh Metnick. For these efficiency gains, an average GPU device costs only twice as much as the average CPU device.

These efficiency gains were quickly overshadowed the following year, in 2011, when field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) were also re-modeled to mine bitcoin.

According to Metnick’s calculations, FPGAs are able to compute the mathematical operations required to mine bitcoin twice as fast as the highest grade GPU. However, these devices are more labor-intensive to build. FPGAs require configuration on both a software and hardware level, meaning the devices must be programmed to run customized code, as well as architected to run that code efficiently. It is the ability to adjust hardware components on an FPGA that makes these types of devices better optimized for bitcoin mining than a GPU.

ASIC mining

The third major innovation to bitcoin mining likely required the largest amount of dedicated resources, time and development to achieve. Rather than repurposing the software and hardware parameters of existing machines, efforts to create an entirely new machine that would only mine bitcoin finally paid off. In 2013, a China-based computer hardware manufacturer called Canaan Creative released the first set of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for bitcoin mining.

These devices, unlike CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs, were designed at their outset to mine bitcoin. This meant that all hardware and software components of these ASIC devices came pre-designed and optimized to compute strictly those calculations necessary to create new bitcoin blocks. The efficiency gains from ASICs could not be matched by any of the more general purpose devices that preceded it.

While Canaan Creative was the first bitcoin ASIC manufacturer, others such as Bitmain and MicroBT also came up with new versions of ASIC bitcoin mining devices with increasingly advanced hardware. One of the most noticeable developments in ASIC mining technology since 2013 has been a steady reduction in chip size. The size of ASIC chips which started off at a size of 130nm in 2013 has shrunk considerably to be as small as 7nm in the latest hardware models.

Without a radical new ground-breaking technology, bitcoin miners will soon stop competing primarily on the basis of hardware and equipment as was the case for the past decade.

The significance of chip size comes back to mining efficiency. The wider the surface of an ASIC chip, the larger its communication channels and therefore the more electricity required to transmit data on its surface. According to Metnick’s calculations, an ASIC bitcoin mining device today is 100 billion times the speed of the average CPU back in 2009.

Rakesh Kumar, associate professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, believes a strong motivating factor of mining hardware evolution over the years since bitcoin’s creation has been the rising dollar value of bitcoin, which made mining an increasingly lucrative activity. The higher the market value of block rewards, the higher the payoff for innovations in mining technology that boost miner profit margins while decreasing operating costs.

The future of bitcoin mining

Since 2015, chip size reduction in ASIC bitcoin mining devices has been slower and less dramatic than in 2013 and 2014. What’s more, since the first bitcoin ASIC miner there has not been a new technology to leapfrog mining efficiency gains in the same way GPU mining had for CPU mining or FPGA mining had for GPU mining.

“We are hitting fundamental limits,” Kumar said. “It’s a problem with the entire industry, not just [bitcoin] mining, but the entire semiconductor industry…We need a new kind of device.”

Without a radical new ground-breaking technology, bitcoin miners will soon stop competing primarily on the basis of hardware and equipment as was the case for the past decade. Should bitcoin mining hardware become commoditized where efficiency gains of one model differ minutely from a newer model, miners will be forced to consider other areas in which to gain a competitive advantage. These could fall under innovations in energy sourcing, financial planning, or even product diversification.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Changpeng Zhao's net worth is around $2.6 billion, double that of a year ago.

The exchange he founded, Binance, became the largest on the planet in less than half a year.

CZ now uses a considerable part of his fortune for philanthropy through the Binance Charitable Foundation.

Zhao likely reinvests a significant portion of his wealth back into expanding the Binance empire.

Share this article

Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, has become one of the most influential people in crypto. He’s also one of the industry’s most powerful as a result of the incredible success of his exchange, Binance. Here’s how he ascended to power.

Technologist to Cryptocurrency Tycoon

CZ was born in China and raised in Vancouver, Canada. Zhao later worked in New York and Tokyo building trading software after graduating from McGill University in Montreal.

Zhao has a long history of building infrastructure and systems for exchanges. In 2005, he moved to Shanghai to establish Fusion Systems, which built high-frequency trading systems for stock brokers.

After becoming interested in cryptocurrency, CZ got involved in a number of crypto projects. He joined Blockchain.com in 2013 as the third member of its team. In 2014, he served as the CTO of another popular crypto exchange, OKCoin. He left the role a year later citing a “difference of direction,” and went on to launch a startup that provided cloud-based services to exchange operators in its place

Finally, in 2017, he decided to found his own exchange—Binance. The exchange was launched after a $15 million raise during the Binance Coin, or BNB, token offering.

By early 2018, Binance was the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, and it has already expanded its operations to the United States, Singapore, Uganda, and Jersey.

Binance’s Rise to the Top

Low fees, shrewd marketing, and a huge number of available cryptocurrencies allowed Binance to grow from a fledgling startup in 2017 to the most popular crypto exchange in the world in a mere 180 days. Sustained innovation and operational skill have allowed Binance to maintain this dominance.

Binance’s rapid rise was fueled by low trading fees and competitive features. Those that chose to pay in Binance’s native token, Binance Coin, traded with even lower fees. Even the most expensive fee tier for Binance is only 0.1%. These fees get even lower as a trader becomes more active.

Coinbase, for reference, includes a flat charge that can represent trading fees of more than 10% for small transactions. Meanwhile, Coinbase Pro charges fees as high as 0.5%, five times that of Binance’s most expensive tier.

The breadth of Binance’s coin offering also allows it to compete with other more conservative crypto exchanges. Coinbase Pro, for example, currently offers fewer than 60 trading pairs. Binance, meanwhile, offers over 600 trading pairs and supports three times as many digital assets.

Minimal fees and an expansive list of tradeable assets helped propel Binance to the top. When the crypto market began to heat up in 2017 Binance was well positioned to serve the influx of new traders.

How Profitable is Binance?

As a privately held company, Binance is under no obligation to reveal its revenues or profits. However, the exchange has long held a policy of burning an estimated 20% of its quarterly profits in BNB.

Working backwards, it’s possible to estimate Binance’s profitability. Its tenth burn in Q4 2019, for example, took 2.2 million BNB tokens out of circulation, worth around $40 million at the time.

However, the exchange had previously changed its burn policy, which now represents “activity” on the exchange’s various trading solutions, rather than profits. That may make BNB burn events less indicative of Binance’s profitability.

The exchange’s 11th quarterly burn in April this year saw almost 3.5 million BNB tokens destroyed. That was the equivalent of over $50 million.

Excluding the last two burns, it is possible to calculate Binance’s profits from the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2019. During that time, the exchange burned $170 million worth of BNB tokens, representing an estimated 20% of its profits.

Using this logic, that means Binance earned an estimated $850 million in profits from July 2017 to October 2019. It is thought to have crossed the $1 billion cumulative profit mark soon after, based on media reports. This number will only grow as the cryptocurrency enters the mainstream.

200 million BNB tokens were originally issued according to the Binance whitepaper. 50% of these tokens were allocated to ICO investors, 40% went to the founding team, and angel investors took the remaining 10%.

That means the founding team held, upon launch, 80 million BNB. There were six members of the founding team. However, in mid-2019 they decided to give up the team’s initial allocation. That said, the exchange is burning these tokens gradually, so its impact on supply may takes years to fully materialize.

However, with Binance earning trading revenues in BNB, the exchange continues to accumulate these tokens.

Prices for BNB have risen significantly as a result of this decreasing supply along with the coin’s rising utility. From its initial offering price of 10 cents, BNB currently trades for around $15, with its all-time high at almost $40 in June 2019.

What is Changpeng Zhao’s Net Worth?

CZ holds most of his fortune in crypto and claims to have very little in the way of fiat money. In mid-2018 he revealed that he had a personal fortune of over $2 billion.

In February 2018, CZ was third on the Forbes “Prophets Of Boom” list of crypto billionaires, behind Ripple’s Chris Larsen and Joseph Lubin of Ethereum and ConsenSys. They estimated his net worth between $1.2 and $2 billion.

Changpeng Zhao fell off the Forbes Rich List in 2020, with an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion. He came in at 1,818 in 2019, and number 216 on China’s Rich List in 2018. His fall away from the list could have resulted from the dramatic drop in cryptocurrency prices that year.

A recent Hurun Global Rich List placed Changpeng Zhao as the richest billionaire in crypto, an industry that has created six billionaires so far. They named CZ at 1,097th place on their global rich list.

Based on figures from Binance’s estimated revenues, we estimate Zhao’s personal fortune at double what it was in Forbes’ 2018 calculation. Today, Changpeng Zhao’s net worth is around $2.6 billion.

How Is CZ Using His Fortune?

Like many billionaires, CZ is also an active philanthropist. He is a board member of the Binance Charity Foundation, which supports a wide range of charitable initiatives.

Binance changed its listing fee policy at the end of 2018, asking teams who wanted to list on the exchange to instead make a donation to one of their charities. The exchange also recently launched a $5 million coronavirus relief campaign with donation matching.

But, like many entrepreneurs, most of Zhao’s fortune is likely getting reinvested in his exchange. This could help explain the impressive pace at which Binance is innovating.

Binance regularly adds new financial instruments. In 2019, the exchange rolled out futures, margin trading, lending, staking, and even its own stablecoin (BUSD). These bold additions allow the exchange to compete directly with more specialized competitors, like derivatives exchange BitMEX or lending platform BlockFi.

The exchange is also building out key infrastructure through Binance-branded fiat-to-crypto exchanges, including Binance.US and four other branded exchanges.

The exchange is innovating in terms of technology as well. It began offering a decentralized exchange through Binance DEX, the first major exchange to do so. It was also one of the first exchanges to pioneer the initial exchange offering, or IEO, through Binance Launchpad. The exchange even developed its own blockchain to compete with the likes of Ethereum, Binance Chain.

Binance isn’t afraid to make strategic investments, either. High-profile acquisitions like CoinMarketCap, Mars Finance, TravelbyBit, and Trust Wallet have expanded Binance’s sphere of influence far beyond that of just a cryptocurrency exchange.

Given these bold moves, Changpeng Zhao is expected to maintain his position as one of the wealthiest and most influential people in cryptocurrency.","Gold is the same as Bitcoin in the same way that oil is the same as Ethereum, according to Alexander Blum, crypto investment expert and Chief Operating Officer of fintech firm Two Prime.

Blum believes that Ethereum draws parallels to oil as it relies on a particular utility, while Bitcoin and gold are seen as more reliable stores of value.

His comments come after a sensational crash in the price of oil that was spurred by a lack of demand of insufficient storage.

“Last week was a really bizarre situation with oil prices moving below zero for oil futures. Nobody is traveling — no one is using gas as they’re not driving, flying, or on cruises — and oil prices were already in a bad place to begin with. While this is great for the environment, it’s not good for the oil business. Storing oil has been more expensive than the price at which it’s being sold, and hence, we saw the price crash.” Blum commented.

Coin Rivet reported on oil’s desperate descent when it plunged to $10 before suffering a capitulation low of negative $40.

The severity of the crash caused shockwaves across all global markets aside from cryptocurrencies, which actually performed well with stability and a slight charge to the upside.

“Oil has historically been one of the most reliable stores of value outside of precious metals. The price of oil has already been falling gradually, and the virus accelerated its plummet.” Blum continued.

“If Bitcoin is likened to gold, Ethereum is more like oil. If Ethereum no longer had any technical use, there would be no utility for it. Oil and Ethereum both rely on some type of utility. Like gold, Bitcoin has little intrinsic value, but its simplicity is its strength, not its weakness. Sometimes simplicity can be a good thing, especially when markets are turbulent.”

Rumors are rife that the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-Un, is either seriously ill or has passed on.

The country has been known to own a significant amount of Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies.

With no confirmation of the Supreme Leader’s well being, Crypto traders have started speculating on the future of the country’s crypto holdings.

News of North Korea’s Supreme Leader not being well or having passed on has circulated globally for the last half of this week. According to Aljazeera, Kim Jong Un has been absent from state media, official statements and public events leading many to believe all is not well. One theory that has been put forth by TMZ, is that the Supreme Leader had grabbed his chest and collapsed in early April while visiting N. Korea’s countryside.

The online media outlet known for breaking celebrity news went on to explain that he is either bedridden with no hope of recovery or he has passed on. This is after life-saving heart surgery was performed on the Supreme Leader. TMZ further explained the situation as follows:

He needed a stent procedure done, but apparently … it either wasn’t done rapidly enough, or it was botched completely by the surgeon — with some reports saying he had shaky hands.

Crypto Traders Start to Speculate on the Fate of N. Korea’s Bitcoin (BTC) and Crypto Holdings

Back in mid-2019, news broke that the country of North Korea was amassing Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies with a value of $670 Million at the time. The funds were apparently being used by the nation to bypass strict economic sanctions.

It is this amount that has many crypto traders talking. Many are wondering whether the country’s stash of Bitcoin (BTC) will be sold soon and cause a crash in the crypto markets. Crypto user @milllly shared the following tweet explaining that her social media groups on Weibo and WeChat were rife with speculation that 65,091 BTC from a wallet belonging to Kim Jong-Un had been moved to Coinbase.

Woke up, saw everyone is talking about this . Literally everywhere , weibo,WeChat groups, all crypto medias @zackvoell pic.twitter.com/gltiIIsEXX — Molly (@bigmagicdao) April 26, 2020

Upon further investigation, the messages on her social media groups were a reaction to a joke by @zackvoell. The joke had suggested some Bitcoin had been moved from an alleged wallet belonging to Supreme Leader Kim. A screenshot of the joke can be found below.

The economic repercussions of this are staggering and will take months to fully comprehend – but, more short term, one of the most fascinating aspects is how it knocks universally accepted truths about markets right into the oil can.

Also compelling is what this says about biases in the bitcoin market.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view.

It turns out commodity prices don’t have a floor. Who knew. To be fair, this is not the first time a commodity has traded below zero – natural gas prices have gone negative in the past as logistical problems make it hard to get to buyers, and many refineries see it as a waste byproduct of oil production. Outside the energy sector, dairy farmers across the U.S. are currently dumping excess milk rather than pay consumers to take it away.

What does this have to do with bitcoin? It sheds light on the nature of the asset itself, and on products built on top of it.

According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and other regulators, bitcoin is a commodity. Technically, it falls into the category of financial commodities, which include currencies and indices. These do have a floor. They can go to zero, but not below – once at the minimum, they have neither a use nor a carry cost, so investors can write off their value and, after some gnashing of teeth, forget about them.

But what if a financial commodity’s value was based on an underlying commodity that traded at negative prices? USO is the largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the energy sector and holds near-dated WTI futures. This week those futures were trading below zero, since they involve physical delivery of oil that no one knows where to store. But the ETF is a financial commodity, and cannot trade below zero – therefore, it cannot reflect its underlying assets.

This week, USO scrambled to save its listing. It announced a reverse share split to push its price back above the Nasdaq minimum requirement, and it changed its investment strategy to focus on slightly longer-term futures. It also applied for authorization to issue more shares, since money is pouring in, reportedly from retail investors who hope to ride the recovery all the way up.

Fund inflows into USO Source: FactSet

So, here you have an ETF whose value does not necessarily reflect the underlying asset, maneuvering to be able to sell more shares to retail investors in a dislocated market that is one of the most blatantly manipulated in the world. And yet, bitcoin ETF proposals are rejected as being too risky, opaque and manipulable.

A bitcoin ETF would be based on a financial commodity that runs on a global network accessible to all. Most of the main exchanges have market surveillance, and improvements in market liquidity should enable the ETF price to closely track the market value of the underlying asset, giving investors reassuring clarity and transparency. The same cannot be said of the most liquid listed bitcoin-tracking instruments today,* which have lock-in periods during which investors cannot sell and which trade at a significant premium to bitcoin. This is largely a result of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s reluctance to approve liquid and easily redeemable investment vehicles suitable for all types of investors.

Any change in SEC policy regarding bitcoin ETFs is unlikely in the short term because there are no current proposals under consideration. But the disconnect between the reasons given for rejection and the glaringly public characteristics of many approved ETFs that also don’t meet the quoted criteria could encourage the regulator to overcome its instinctive reluctance.

Anyone know what's going on yet?

There is no such thing as a boring week in the crypto asset sector (unfortunately – a boring week would be nice every now and then), but this week was particularly intense, with the price ranging 12 percent from low to high (data from the CoinDesk BPI).

According to my colleague Zack Voell, the sharp jump upwards may have been motivated by the futures expiry on Friday, as well as by investor sentiment primed for a move after the recent consolidation. And maybe – just maybe – it has something to do with mounting excitement over the upcoming bitcoin halving, expected in just over two weeks. (Download our recent report on the bitcoin halving for analysis of its potential impact.)

Outside the crypto space, things are getting even weirder as disinfectant manufacturers plead with us not to inject their products, and traders eye their bathtubs and kitchen pots for possible oil storage. Tensions are rising in Europe as Italy, the European Union’s third-largest economy, has been pity-spared a drop to junk bond status. Asian markets are dealing with the suspense over North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un’s health and the unrelated threat of a second wave of contagion. Markets are reeling between relief things aren’t even worse and fear they will be, with a dose of denial thrown in.

Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 so far this week, month and year to date, although gold and long-term government bonds have done significantly better so far this year.

Next week will see a slew of economic indicators that will most likely be shockingly awful, but this week the futures actually went up on the news that more than four million people applied for benefits, because it seems confirmation of bad news is somewhat reassuring. You do have to wonder when the penny will drop that indices suspended from reality don’t stay afloat forever. On the other hand, some economies are tentatively eyeing a re-opening of some sort, which will bring a welcome if tentative respite to restive animal spirits.

Chain links

The Economist magazine dives into the options available to governments trying to figure out how to guide their economies out of this crisis. The options, none of which look good, include following the “financial repression” policies of the post-war economies of the previous century, which could take the form of capital controls, fixed exchange rates, rationed bank lending and caps on interest rates. It acknowledges such changes would be “politically demanding,” but that these are politically demanding times. “But if governments did enact such changes,” it goes on, “they would spur responses unavailable to investors of the 1950s and 1960s, such as investment in cryptocurrencies and other immaterial products.” TAKEAWAY: Exactly. The modern economy has gone through hardship before that required ideological sacrifices, but not at a time when there were alternatives to central bank currencies, and not at a time when it was possible to move wealth without using the established system. Does that make governments weaker at the expense of empowered citizens? Or could the governments use cryptocurrencies to become empowered themselves?

I’ve mentioned in this newsletter before that I worry about a sustained uptick in inflation once we have emerged from the worst of this crisis, and how that could be good for bitcoin’s value given its limited supply. But what if I’m wrong and we enter a world of deflation? Does that mean bitcoin will underperform? Not necessarily. The resulting boost in its purchasing power and its parallels to gold, which has traditionally done well in times of deflation, could give it fuel to outperform. TAKEAWAY: Bitcoin was born during the last financial crisis, so its reactions and correlations have not been tested. We do not know under which scenario it will perform best, and economic theory can justify swings either way.

Crypto asset platform Coinbase describes the current stablecoin landscape, with a focus on use cases. TAKEAWAY: The power of stablecoins to encourage liquidity, facilitate transactions and act as collateral is just beginning to be understood. The growth this year is likely to continue to be staggering, driven largely by both transaction demand and a surging global demand for dollars, of which stablecoins are a relatively convenient and liquid representation. (For more on this topic, see Michael Casey’s newsletter, “Money Reimagined,” from last week.)

A research paper funded by University of California Berkeley’s Haas Blockchain Initiative concludes stablecoin issuances do not push up the price of cryptocurrencies. TAKEAWAY: This contradicts a controversial paper from last year that aimed to prove tether manipulated the bitcoin market. The new paper separates tether in circulation from tether held in treasury, and shows the stablecoin’s premium to the dollar depends largely on the market volatility.

More nuance on last week’s news that Renaissance Technologies has submitted regulatory filings showing its flagship fund Medallion can invest in bitcoin derivatives – as we hinted last week, it’s not as bullish as the media initially painted it. TAKEAWAY: My colleague Ian Allison asked several industry insiders for their take on the news. All agree Renaissance is not necessarily going “long bitcoin.” The story and the potential are not what drives their decisions; those are based on algorithmically generated numbers.

Starbucks and McDonald’s are reportedly among 19 restaurants and retail shops that will be involved in testing China’s central bank digital currency in the country’s Xiong’An new district. TAKEAWAY: Why is this potentially relevant for portfolios? Because mandated change is usually more powerful in overcoming resistance to new habits than the pull of innovation on its own. A national digital currency would get people comfortable with the idea of digital wallets, for instance, and from there it’s a relatively short step to incorporating other tokens and services. This is potentially significant because of its indirect relevance to the adoption of crypto assets in one of the largest economies, in which almost one billion people have a smartphone.

Wolfie Zhao walks us through changes to the bitcoin mining industry in China over the past year, going into the impact of the coronavirus, how the March crash shifted sentiment, and the outlook for the new machines hitting the market. TAKEAWAY: As we talked about in our Halving Report, the bitcoin mining industry is not only fascinating, it’s fundamental for the health of the network. Shifts in technology, economic conditions and political environment determine profitability which in turn impacts the protocol’s resilience. For more on this intriguing sector, at the intersection between business priorities, technological innovation and ideology, check out Christine Kim’s podcast series on miner economics.

The CFTC has given crypto startup Bitnomial Exchange approval to offer physically settled futures and options contracts. TAKEAWAY: Not that long ago a lot of us got excited about the pending launch of physically delivered derivatives on Bakkt, which ended up having a disappointing launch and an even more disappointing trading record. Bitnomial’s fee and margin structure might end up being more attractive to investors and traders, but, unlike Bakkt, for now it lacks the blue-chip backing of a market incumbent.

Crypto asset and blockchain data provider Amberdata lays out a detailed explanation of the stock-to-flow (S2F) model that predicts a bitcoin price of $100,000 by the middle of 2021. TAKEAWAY: The S2F model has adherents and skeptics – it seems to hold historically, but that’s not generally a good basis for forward investing, especially in these strange times. Check out our Halving Report for a look at some competing theses. The bottom line is the bitcoin market is so different now than during the previous halvings that no one knows what features or developments will carry more weight in price impact.

Vishal Shah, founder of bitcoin derivatives exchange Alpha5, points out that, with 100x leverage available on some exchanges with relatively light oversight, bitcoin won’t interest “traditional” capital, especially in these uncertain times. TAKEAWAY: It’s unlikely that 100x leverage is actually used by most traders, however – the few brave souls that do so are likely to get wiped out pretty soon, leaving the more sensible traders who push the boat out to maybe 35x, if that. “100x leverage” is more a worrisome marketing gimmick than a wealth accumulation strategy.","The 5 Best Cryptocurrency Data APIs in 2020

2,879 reads

@ CryptoGlobe John Technical writer at CryptoGlobe covering all things data and crypto, HMU at jmedley@cryptoglobe.com

From enterprise clients such as funds, traders and tax companies, to market makers, researchers, developers and crypto hobbyists - all are in need of a top cryptocurrency API. As the industry grows and matures, the quality of the data being offered to track cryptocurrencies has similarly grown, and the data on offer changes from year to year. But how do you decide which is best?

In this article, we break down the top 5 crypto APIs for 2020.

We assess the five APIs according to 11 criteria, so you can decide which API is best for your use case and highlight some standout features and drawbacks of those on offer.

The table below summarizes how we assess the APIs:

CryptoCompare

Founded in 2014, CryptoCompare is one of the most established data providers in the space, with several high profile clients including BT, Coinbase and Refinitiv. Offering four tiers of plan - Free, Professional, Corporate and Enterprise, their pricing ranges from $79.99 up to $199 for the Corporate plan, with custom pricing for Enterprise clients.

Featuring 273 exchanges, the CryptoCompare API stands out for the widest array of endpoints - standing at over 80 - including streaming, minute and blockchain data from partner IntoTheBlock.

Its Free tier offers all 80 endpoints, but is restricted to 1 day for its minute data and 3 months for hourly. However, it offers a generous 100,000 monthly calls as well as access to all 80 endpoints.

Offering REST, Websocket, and FIX connections, it has the best connectivity options in the group, as well as additional features including SLAs and Private Servers.

Good for Enterprise and power users such as traders, it provides granular tick data and real-time update frequency and a high level of customer support with a dedicated slack channel for clients.

CoinMarketCap

Boasting clients such as Samsung and Coinbase, one of the most recognized names in the cryptocurrency space, CoinMarktetCap is the first port of call for many checking cryptoasset prices.

Its API comes in six tiers - Basic, Hobbyist, Startup, Standard, Professional and Enterprise - and ranges from free to $699 per month for its Professional plan and custom pricing for its Enterprise plan at the highest end. It features a wide range of cryptoassets, and offers from 9 endpoints (free plan) all the way up to 22 at the higher end of its price plans, as well as some partner integrations such as FCAS crypto ratings.

Free users get 10,000 calls a month, which would likely be enough for most casual users, but it does not offer access to historical data. Integrated with 319 exchanges, the second-highest in the group, CoinMarketCap offers a good service for those looking to find data on smaller niche exchanges.

With only 1 minute update frequency and 22 endpoints, if you are after real-time pricing and tick data as a trader or enterprise client, or a wide range of data endpoints, this may not be the API for you. CoinMarketCap’s support only extends to email at the highest level. - a point worth noting for power enterprise users.

Nomics

Founded more recently than the others in this group in 2017, Nomics features partners such as Coinbase, the Digital Currency Group and Polymath and offers a price ranking on their website. The Nomics API comes in two tiers, Free and Business (with no pricing featured on the site) and features a respectable 242 exchanges.

The API is a good choice for enterprise customers and traders with SLAs on offer, both REST and Websocket, granular tick data with real-time updates, and no rate limits - although at only 17 endpoints - it offers the fewest endpoints to paid customers, and has no mention of pricing at this level.

For free users, the options are very limited with only a few endpoints available, and no historical data.

Kaiko

A data provider which began operations in 2014, unlike the other 4 API providers we examine here, Kaiko has no coin listing section on their site, focusing only on data provision. With clients including ChainLink and Ledger, Kaiko’s API caters only to paying users - with a 1 week free trial and offers two paid tiers Pro and Enterprise (with no pricing featured).

Offering no real free plan, and a limited number of exchanges, it is not really appropriate for free or hobbyist users.

Offering a high level of customer support at its top end - with a dedicated slack channel for its Enterprise clients, it also offers data in both REST and Websocket connection. With granular tick data, and real-time update frequency, it offers fast data connections - making it a good choice for enterprise and trading clients, but currently only supports 12 endpoints. It is limited to 85 exchanges, so will cater to those interested only in the top bracket of exchanges.

CoinGecko

A very popular site for checking crypto prices, CoinGecko’s API is completely free - with no paid pricing plans. Integrated with the highest number of exchanges at 471, and with a huge 4 million free calls, CoinGecko stands out from the pack for free users - particularly for researchers or data scientists who have large data requirements or want to include data from smaller niche exchanges.

Offering 21 endpoints, it does not offer the granularity of some of the other APIs considered here, however - with only snapshot data and an estimated 30s update frequency.

For enterprise users or traders, it is not a great choice as with no support offered, only REST connections, and less granular data it is unlikely to meet the demands of more exacting users.

Tags","Crypto Loan Rates 2021

Perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is the ability to take out a loan on top cryptocurrencies at any time in an entirely permissionless fashion.

By using smart contracts, borrowers are able to lock collateral to protect against defaults while seamlessly adding to or closing their loans at any time.

This page is geared at those looking to dive into the exciting world of DeFi borrowing, and our top picks on the platform to take out a cryptocurrency loan.

An Overview of DeFi Loans:

Here are some key characteristics of DeFi loans:

Permissionless – Anyone can borrow cryptocurrencies without having to undergo KYC or get permission from a third party.

Automated – Loans are automatically dispersed at request, with positions being liquidated if a collateralization ratio falls below the predefined threshold.

Non-Custodial – With DeFi loans, there is no need to transfer ownership of their underlying collateral. All funds are secured by smart contracts, with the borrower being responsible for maintaining that position.

Secure – Major borrowing protocols have been rigorously audited, meaning that funds supplied to loans are backed by the most robust code in the world.

Dynamic – The vast majority of borrowing in DeFi leverages variable interest rates which shift relative to the utilization ratio of any given asset.

Perpetual – DeFi loans can be opened for any amount of time, so long as the debt is paid back and the position is sufficiently collateralized

Top Picks

When it comes to cryptocurrency loans, there is an increasing amount of DeFi platforms available to do so. In this section, we’ll describe our top picks, along with some of the reasons as to why borrowing on them is unique.

Aave

As a borrowing platform offering the most diverse amount of loan types, Aave is quickly becoming a market leader in the DeFi sector as a whole. The protocol features roughly 20 of the most popular cryptocurrencies including most major stablecoins and DeFi tokens like SNX, MKR and KNC.

Interest Rates: Fixed or Floating

Why Borrow from Aave?

When taking out a loan on Aave, users can choose to lock in either a fixed or a floating interest rate, providing a degree of flexibility which other lending platforms currently do not offer

Aave has become a primary source for Flash Loans – or the ability to borrow an unlimited amount of assets so long as they are paid back in the same block. This feature has proved useful for preventing Maker Vault liquidations and taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.

Aave recently released a Risk Framework which clearly displays a different rating (from A+ to D-) for assets on the platform. This gives users a clear idea as to which assets are the safest to take a loan on at any given time.

Trade with leverage on Aave borrowing rates using Swap Rate

Borrowing fees are incurred at inception, meaning there are no “gothchyas” when repaying a loan.

Loans can be insured using Nexus Mutual

Read our full review on Aave

Compound

As the sector leading lending platform, Compound has long established itself as having a strong foundation for trusted cryptocurrency loans. While Compound supports fewer assets than Aave, it boasts very liquid capital pools and has been trusted many DeFi protocols as a base for other interest-earning primitives to emerge.

Interest Rates: Floating

Why Borrow from Compound?

As a leading US-based company, Compound has proved itself to be a reputable provider with a strong reputation and backing from top investment firms

Compound currently has the most underlying collateral of any lending protocol – meaning the capacity for loans is quite high

Using tools like Swap Rate and Opyn, users can hedge against variable interest rates and lock in fixed rates on loans

Borrowers can insure their loans using Nexus Mutual

Users can leverage asset management tools like Zerion and DeFi Saver to manage their Compound loans.

Read our full review on Compound

Maker

As the creators of Dai, Maker has created quite an interesting cycle for taking out a loan on a stable, trustless asset. Using Oasis Borrow, users can lock collateral (currently ETH, USDC or BAT) to mint Dai. Locked collateral incurs a “Stability Fee” which can be paid back at any time.

Interest Rates: Floating

Why Borrow from Maker?

As a stablecoin, it’s easy to know exactly how much debt will be owed on any given loan

Users can easily re-collateralize or draw additional Dai directly from the Oasis dashboard

At the time of writing, there is currently no fee to take out a loan on Maker.

Asset management tools like DeFi Saver allow users to leverage automated tools to ensure Vaults are sufficiently collateralized, even in times of high volatility.

Maker Vaults are integrated into other asset management tools like InstaDapp or Zerion for easier tracking.

Read our full review on Maker

dYdX

As a hybrid DEX, lending, and margin trading platform, dYdX is a great way for users to “borrow” cryptocurrencies to open leveraged loans on ETH and soon BTC.

Interest rates: Floating

Why Borrow from dYdX?

Opening a loan on dYdX does not incur a transaction fee

Users can borrow USDC, DAI or ETH to open up to 5x leveraged positions on ETH

dYdX recently introduced perpetual futures, meaning users will be able to open up to a 10x leveraged position on BTC

dYdX uses cross-margin, meaning users can pool together all their assets on the platform, rather than using only one.

Read our full review on dYdX

Key Points to Consider

While we’ve listed our top four picks above, there are dozens of other platforms for users to take out a cryptocurrency loan. Here are some things to keep in mind:

Relative Rates – Rates on loans can change quite frequently, so be sure to keep a close eye on the market pair as the rate a borrow is started with is likely to differ from its rate when the loan needs to be repaid.

Custody – Be sure to note if a loan is custodial or non-custodial. It’s important to ensure the underlying collateral backing the loan has as little attack vectors as possible.

Audit History – All borrowing protocols should have received a number of audits before their official launch. Please take a moment to research if a borrowing platform has a reputable audit history before supplying capital.

Beta Mode – Many borrowing protocols are likely to indicate the current stage of their project. It’s ok to use a platform which is in beta, but please be advised this means there is a higher degree of risk.

Social Presence – Projects which have community-backing are often most active on social media. If you’re on the fence about borrowing from any given protocol, check out their Twitter to see if the community in engaging with their posts as a signal of trust.

DeFi Crypto Loan Platforms [2020]

DeFi loans are largely characterized by non-custodial, dynamic, floating interest rates. This includes:

Centralized Crypto Loan Platforms [2020]

Centralized loan protocols are largely characterized by fixed interest rates in which assets must be transferred and locked for a predefined period of time.

BlockFi

Binance

Bitfinex

Coinbase

CoinList

Crypto.com

Poloniex

Popular Cryptocurrencies to Collateralize Loans With

Whereas with lending we’ve seen that stablecoins are the most lucrative option to supply as capital, we’ve seen quite a different trend emerge with cryptocurrency loans.

Ether is the “fuel” that powers Ethereum and is primarily used as payment for transacting on the network.

Due to the liquid nature of ETH, we’ve seen the vast majority of borrows being dominated by ETH as collateral.

While ETH remains a volatile asset, it is supported by virtually every borrowing platform and has quickly emerged as the leading asset to supply as collateral for a cryptocurrency-based loan.

Building off the liquid nature of ETH, Bitcoin is quickly making it’s way to DeFi, largely in the form of borrowing.

Solutions like Atomic Loans allow users to post BTC as collateral and receive stablecoins like USDC or DAI in return.

While we’ve also seen a number of token wrappers emerge (tBTC, wBTC, pBTC, etc.) it’s clear that many are looking to capitalize on the vast market size Bitcoin offers as the leading cryptocurrency. Across the board, it’s evident that users are largely borrowing against assets with high market caps and liquid capital pools.

FAQ","In brief At least 20 cell towers in the UK were burned after a conspiracy theory linking the coronavirus pandemic to 5G technology was spread around the country.

Preacher Jonathon James from Luton, England is reportedly behind the baseless claims.

The evangelical pastor previously tried to convince Zimbabweans to use cryptocurrency in their economy, The Guardian reports.

The man behind the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory is a crypto-loving evangelical pastor, a major UK national newspaper has revealed.

According to a Friday report by The Guardian, preacher Jonathon James is one of those responsible for spreading the conspiracy theory that 5G cell phone towers cause coronavirus. The attack of at least 20 5G cell towers and masts in the UK followed viral posts from James and other conspiracy theorists.

The preacher, from the town of Luton, England, made bizarre and baseless claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for governments to install 5G mobile phone masts and for Bill Gates to track the world’s population, according to The Guardian.

In a 38-minute video on YouTube, James claimed it was “unequivocally proven that the radio frequencies” were killing people—and not COVID-19. It was spread around the UK and gullible people in Liverpool and the West Midlands later set 5G cell towers on fire.

The recording has since been deleted from YouTube but is still widely circulating on WhatsApp, The Guardian reported.

James, who preaches in a number of churches in the southern UK county of Bedfordshire, had previously advised a Zimbabwean opposition party to use cryptocurrency in order to save the economy, the newspaper added.

In 2018, he reportedly told the party that a currency pegged to mineral reserves would be the best way to tackle inflation. He also claims to have advised Bangladesh on cryptocurrencies, The Guardian’s report said.

James, who formerly worked for telecommunications giant Vodafone, reportedly told The Guardian that he was “absolutely shocked” the message went viral and that it was only intended to be for a “small community.” The newspaper added that he said he “wasn’t trying to vilify, incriminate or implicate any mobile network operator.”

Other conspiracy theories linking COVID-19 to 5G technology have since been spread, but scientists labeled them “complete rubbish”. Britain’s NHS England Medical Director Stephen Powis called them ""the worst kind of fake news.”

Whether or not it is God’s plan for James to advise the world’s governments on crypto, one thing is for sure: he shouldn’t be advising them on how to manage the coronavirus crisis."
2020-04-27,"Bitcoin’s rally is gathering pace with the mining reward halving now just 14 days away.

The top cryptocurrency by market value rose to $7,800 early on Monday to hit its highest level since March 12 – dubbed “Black Thursday” – when prices fell from $7,950 to $4,700 as the coronavirus pandemic crashed most markets.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $7,700, representing a 100 percent gain on the low of $3,867 registered on March 13.

While the major part of the recovery rally could be associated with the uptick in the S&P 500 and the global stock markets, the recent move from the April 21 low of $6,800 to $7,800 looks to have been fueled by factors other than moves in equities.

That’s evident from the fact that bitcoin rose 8 percent last week, while the S&P 500 suffered a 1.3 percent loss and oil markets cratered on oversupply concerns.

Bitcoin looks to have partly decoupled from the equity markets due to the bullish narrative surrounding the upcoming halving. “The rally is being sustained by the rapidly approaching halving,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Keneti Capital, told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin will undergo the halving process on May 12, after which the reward per block mined will drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.50 BTC.

A popular narrative is that halving creates a supply deficit and, thus, bodes well for bitcoin’s price. Some observers are of the opinion that the bull markets seen in 2017 and 2013 were the result of the halvings in 2016 and 2012, respectively.

“Look for prices to attempt the $10,000 level on speculative buzz leading into the halving,” Chu added. Meanwhile, Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of cryptocurrency platform Luno, said, “History tells us that we should expect an uplift in bitcoin’s price as we get closer to the halving in just a few weeks’ time. We’ve seen an increase in the price of bitcoin in previous halvings.”

Past data shows the cryptocurrency tends to hit a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a halving – but before the event, according to analyst Rekt Capital.

If the historical pattern repeats, we could see a rise to levels above $13,880 (2019 high) before the third halving, due in two weeks.

While that target looks far-fetched, a convincing break above $8,000 cannot be ruled out, as on-chain data shows a significant improvement in network activity.

For example, the seven-day average of the number of active bitcoin entities recently rose above 260,000 for the first time since June 2019, signaling an influx of new investors into the market, according to blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.

Source: glassnode

The active entities metric counts clusters of bitcoin addresses controlled by the same network entity. It shows the number of individuals or businesses using the network, in effect.

Further, bitcoin balances on exchanges continue to drop ahead of reward halving – a sign users are withdrawing their assets for longer-term holding. The metric appears to reflect bullish expectations tied to the halving.

What’s more, institutions and macro traders are returning to the crypto markets after last month’s crash, as suggested by the rise in open interest, or open positions, in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) – widely considered to be synonymous with institutional activity.

Open interest rose to 233 million last Thursday

to hit the highest level since Feb. 26, according to crypto derivatives

research firm Skew.

However, while on-chain activity and derivatives data suggest scope for further gains, the equity markets are calling for caution.

As of Friday, the S&P 500 was up nearly 30 percent from the low of 2,192 reached on March 24 and down 17 percent from record highs. While the recovery rally looks impressive on the surface, the breadth of the move has been quite narrow, meaning the rally has been fueled by an uptick in few heavyweight stocks.

“The S&P 500 now trades just 17 percent below its all-time high, however, the median S&P 500 constituent trades 28 percent below its record high,” said Goldman Sachs’ chief equity strategist David Kostin.

Such rallies are often short-lived. If equities begin falling again, cash may again become a safe haven. In that case, bitcoin may come under pressure, too.","Grayscale Buys 50% of All Ethereum Mined in 2020

Digital asset manager Grayscale Investments bought about 50% of all newly mined ethereum so far this year. It now holds the equivalent of 1.1% of ETH in circulation, according to a post on Reddit.

Grayscale operates 10 cryptocurrency investment products focused on institutional investors. As of April 24, the company had $2.7 billion worth of digital assets under management. The Ethereum Trust accounts for $234.7 million of investments while more than $2.3 billion are held in the Bitcoin Trust. Other funds cover BCH, zcash, XRP, and more.

As per the post, Grayscale bought 756,539 ETH since the beginning of this year. That’s 48.4% of all coins extracted since the start of 2020. In total, 1,563,245 ether have been mined during this period. The Redditor opined:

Given the recent increase in investments, this percentage could be much larger in the future.

Grayscale has been aggressively stockpiling ethereum. The cryptocurrency asset manager reported that its ETH inflows reached an all-time high during the first quarter of 2020. It said inflows to the Ethereum Trust reached $110 million in the quarter, compared to combined inflows for the previous two years of $95.8 million.

With the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, institutional investors can gain exposure to ETH but without actually owning any coins. This means Grayscale will have to hold large amounts of ether in its portfolio.

There’s also the planned upcoming Ethereum 2.0, which might be leading investors to take positions in ETH. The system upgrade will reward new coins to “validators” holding at least 32 ETH.

The price of ethereum has risen sharply since the March 12 crash, spurred by the network’s imminent switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake or the so-called Ethereum 2.0.

ETH is up more than 40% in the last 30 days and about 8% in the last week. At the time of writing, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was down 0.93% to $193.20 over the past 24 hours, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com.

The coronavirus crisis has sent investors in both digital and traditional markets scrambling for U.S. dollars, seen as one of the best assets to park money in during a deflationary recession. In traditional markets, that’s meant selling risky assets like stocks, junk bonds and developing-country currencies, and parking the proceeds in cash.

In digital-asset markets, there’s been a flurry of demand for tether and other dollar-linked stablecoins, many of them built atop the Ethereum blockchain network. Led by tether (USDT), the total outstanding amount of stablecoins surged this month to nearly $9 billion, from less than $6 billion in early March.

Some cryptocurrency analysts are now starting to ask if the stablecoin surge will boost the price of ether (ETH), which is used to pay fees known as “gas” to help process transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including for other tokens.

Prices for ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, have jumped 53 percent so far in 2020 to about $195. That compares with an 8 percent year-to-date gain for the larger bitcoin.

Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at the cryptocurrency data firm Messari, wrote last week in a report that tether’s use of the Ethereum blockchain “should be positive for ETH.”

“It’s hard to ignore the promise of decentralized programmable money if you’re spending time in the ethereum economy,” he wrote. “This will provide a bid for ETH.”

Ether, sometimes described as the “digital oil ” to bitcoin’s “digital gold,” is the native currency for the Ethereum blockchain, which is known as a platform for easy issuance of new digital tokens as well as for its “smart contract” programming capabilities. In recent years Ethereum has become the premier ecosystem for the white-hot arena of “decentralized finance,” where startup companies and developer teams are designing automated lending and trading protocols that might eventually challenge banks.

Yet, ether is notoriously difficult to value, with traders relying on everything from price-chart patterns to supply-and-demand predictions to discounted cash flow analysis. Earlier this year, one blockchain consultant estimated that the cryptocurrency’s price might shoot as high as $10,000 if half of Argentina’s money supply abandoned the peso for dai, a decentralized dollar-linked stablecoin that’s backed by ether.

“I don’t think we’re at a point where fundamentals are driving these tokens,” says Gary Zigmond, co-founder of Digico Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund. “We’re still at the story stage, where everything’s in the future.”

Messari’s Watkins says the rise of stablecoins might actually pose a longer-term threat to ether because they might usurp its potential use case as a “medium of exchange.”

“In this scenario, ETH will have devolved into its native early branding of digital oil, a commodity-like lubricant for the ethereum blockchain,” he wrote. “ETH would still be valuable like many commodities are, but ETH would not be valued like money is.”

But with the price performance beating bitcoin’s so handily this year, ether bulls probably aren’t worrying too much about the valuation metrics.

Tweet of the day

Bitcoin watch

Source: TradingView

Trend: Bitcoin has nearly erased the losses seen on March 12 – “Black Thursday” – with a move to $7,800 early Monday, and now looks set to extend its five-week winning trend.

The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $7,714 at press time, representing a 0.2 percent gain on the day. Prices rose more than 8 percent in the seven days to April 26 to confirm bitcoin’s sixth straight weekly rise, the longest winning streak since March 2019.

The price rise could be extended further, as bitcoin balances on exchanges continues to slide ahead of the miner reward halving – a sign investors are withdrawing their assets for long-term holding ahead of the supply-cutting event, as noted by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.

Bitcoin has historically put in a positive performance in the weeks leading up to halving, Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of cryptocurrency platform Luno, told CoinDesk. The bullish narrative surrounding the halving could continue to draw bids for the cryptocurrency in the short term.

Further, speculation that savvy investors might use recently minted tether and other stablecoins to fund bitcoin purchases is likely to keep retail interest high. “Traders will want to pay close attention to the issuing of new USDT, which has historically led to a surge in bitcoin’s price. With Tether having minted $120,000,000 USDT, Bitcoin could soon see a surge,” said Swanepoel.

Technical charts, too, are signaling scope for an extension on the price rally. The four-hour chart is reporting a symmetrical triangle breakout, a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout is backed by an above-50 reading on the 14-day relative strength index and higher bars on the MACD histogram, both bullish signals.

Next, the cryptocurrency looks set to test the 100-day moving average at $8,000. The bullish case would weaken if the prices violate the support at $7,390 (low of the symmetrical triangle).","The Dutch crypto market is seeing the first of most likely many small crypto exchanges get squeezed out following the passage of heavily criticized anti-money laundering (AMLD5) regulations.

Announced Friday in a company blog, Bittr founder Ruben Waterman said his bitcoin exchange, launched in 2018, will shut down by April 28 as the one-man operation does not have the capital to meet the new regulations. The Dutch National Bank (DNB) estimates that registration alone costs $36,500, in addition to rolling compliance needs.

The development shows what Dutch regulators expect of financial upstarts and could speak to future hurdles to cryptocurrency development in the greater European Union.

“Above all, Bittr would have to appoint a dedicated compliance officer who’s responsible for compliance with the new regulations,” Ruben wrote Friday. “Who can I appoint? Myself? That probably doesn’t work also being the sole shareholder and director.”

Under Dutch law, businesses pay for their own regulations out of pocket. Ruben said the options for his bitcoin savings platform included keeping a lawyer on retainer, paying a compliance officer or finding a third party to manage compliance costs in addition to the government registration fee – impossible, he said, given the firm’s small size.

Making sense of it all

As CoinDesk reported in December, Dutch cryptocurrency firms were entangled in a protracted battle of semantics with the DNB and Ministry of Finance (FIN) over the implementation of the European Union’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which went into effect in January 2020.

Bitcoin firms CoinDesk spoke with said the DNB and FIN were strengthening the EU directive needlessly while using doublespeak with the Dutch Parliament. The firms alleged the financial regulators had created a de facto licensing regime whereas AMLD5 calls for mere registration of cryptocurrency firms. These allegations were further supported by the Dutch Council of State, a governmental advisory board widely respected in the country, which asked the finance agencies to clarify their proposals.

Members of the Dutch Parliament held two competing priorities in mind: fighting money laundering and supporting the nation’s fintech firms.

In a Parliamentary report from April 21, Dutch Senator Bastiaan van Apeldoorn said it’s unlikely cryptocurrencies are being used on the same scale as cash for money laundering, but they still require supervision.

Finding a soft regulatory touch that wouldn’t displace small players in the market remained the goal, he said.

“The cryptocurrency phenomenon does exist and is likely to take on even larger, if not different, forms in the future. It is therefore good that this is also adequately regulated with regard to money laundering,” van Apeldoorn said. (Editor’s note: This report was translated.)

The legislation was tied up on the point for months, even though the EU called for the directive to go into effect on Jan. 10. Legislation was finally adopted last Tuesday, although opinions on its outcome differ.

Wrote Bittr’s Ruben:

“The Minister of Finance (Wopke Hoekstra) then changed some wording so as to comply with the Council of State’s request but not actually changed any of its content. The Senate has raised questions about this practice but nevertheless approved the new regulations.”

The registration process was still a licensing regime, verbiage aside, Ruben argued. “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck,” he wrote.

Other players

In a blog post last Wednesday, Bitonic, a Dutch exchange led by Daan Kleiman, who also heads a crypto lobbying group VBNL, said the final legislation “resolved the two main issues of concern for Bitonic.” The firm said the DNB and FIN had clarified the difference between licensing and registration plus the associated regulatory costs.

“We will closely monitor this when the law has entered into force, but it appears that for now, the threat of an excessive and costly supervisory regime is off the table,” Bitonic wrote.

Some firms haven’t waited to see what the DNB and FIN would concoct, however. Industry-leading crypto derivatives exchange Deribit left the country for Panama in February, citing uncertainties around the incoming regulation.

“We believe that crypto markets should be freely available to most, and the new regulations would put too-high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise,” Deribit wrote in a January blog post announcing the move.

Arthur Stolk, managing director of Dutch cryptocurrency fund Icoinic, told CoinDesk in an interview that most firms had anticipated the passage and are going to wait it out until a promised evaluation by FIN takes place. His largest concern for smaller firms is with the flat regulatory fee every market participant now has to pay for oversight, as compared to a per-volume cost applied in most cases.

“The problem is that in normal traditional finance, if you are regulated and you have a license you need to pay by your volume. So, it’s a fair deal. Now everyone pays the same. In one year they do the evaluation – please do it by volume because then all the small projects can stay,” Stolk said.

And, unlike other governments, the Netherlands isn’t behind the times on crypto. In fact, it’s trying to lead the charge in the EU for issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to a recent DNB report.","Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance launched its mining pool ""Binance Pool"" on April 27.

The pool will operate with zero fees until May 31, after which the rate will be set at 2.5%. The press release for the pool states that large miners can contact Binance to negotiate an extension of the fee-free period.

Approximately 15 of Binance’s more than 1,000 employees work full-time towards the pool’s operation.

Cross-platform integration

Binance Pool supports both Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining mechanisms.

The pool is integrated with the rest of Binance’s platform — allowing miners to easily transfer funds between Binance Pool and the company’s various platforms, including trading, lending, and staking.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, head of Binance Pool Lisa He stated, “We aim to establish a comprehensive platform for miners that will bring more possibilities to the mining industry by bridging traditional mining to financial services.”

Binance founder and chief executive Changpeng Zhao said, “As an integral part of the global crypto market, empowering miners will therein enable significant growth and scale in the larger industry.”

On April 24, Zhao tweeted that Binance Pool had mined its first block.

Community is cautious of centralization

Binance Pool has received mixed responses from the crypto community, with some commentators expressing concerns that Binance's pool will result in a further centralization of Bitcoin (BTC) hash rate among a small number of pools.

Twitter user ‘HsakaTrades’ tweeted a chart of Bitcoin’s hash rate distribution accompanied by the caption: “This hash distribution chart is soon going to be composed of just one colour.” Another user wrote:

“This either ends super good for Bitcoin with multiple competing mining pools offering mass decentralisation or.... well I guess you can figure out the flipside of the coin.”

Binance claims to be a decentralizing force

In response to the criticism, Lisa He argued that the launch of Binance Pool will comprise a decentralizing force upon the mining sector.

“In 2018, the mining pool of a mining machine manufacturer owned nearly 51% hashing power of the whole Bitcoin network, and the security of the Bitcoin network was doubted,” she stated, adding:","FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that has mainly served the Asia market, is planning to launch a spot exchange in the U.S.

FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried confirmed to The Block on Monday that the U.S. exchange is currently in beta testing and is aiming for an official launch in early May.

According to the FTX.US website, the new exchange has already registered as a money services business (MSB) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and it is working to acquire state-level money transmitter licenses (MTL) from several states.

Both MSB and MTLs are required for financial services firms to legally operate in the U.S. To serve users in New York, FTX needs to apply for a BitLicense as well.

The new exchange will maintain a separate order book from the main FTX derivatives exchange. Currently, the platform offers USD trading pairs for six assets listed, including BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, PAXG, and USDT. Bankman-Fried said it is looking to add more assets and fiat onramp options before the official launch, as well as the margin trading feature for qualified users.

Launched in May 2019, FTX quickly picked up traction and now sits at around $728 million total in 24-hour trading volume, per its website. Since launch, the exchange has primarily served the Asia market and most of its team is based in Hong Kong.

In February, The Block reported that FTX was looking to raise $15 million at a $1 billion valuation, and FTX then launched an equity token that same month. Crypto exchange Binance has invested in FTX, although the exact amount of the investment was not disclosed.

Correction: An earlier version of this report erroneously said that FTX was looking to to raise at a $100 billion valuation. FTX was previously reported by The Block to be raising a $1 billion valuation.","Prove you actually watched an ad by sharing your brainwaves and you'd earn some Bitcoin.

Mind Reading

Microsoft applied for an unusual new patent that would read users’ brainwaves in exchange for cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.

The patent application, which has yet to be granted, describes a system that would scan a user’s brain activity or other biological signals to make sure they completed a task, such as watching a commercial. The system would then use those signals to mine for cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, PC Magazine reports, as a way to compensate the user.

We’ve Seen Worse

The logistics for how such a transaction would occur remain hazy: the application includes details on how such a system’s software may work, but less information on how it would actually be used.

But this wouldn’t be the first time a tech company tried to patent absurd technology — it’s actually a fairly common practice, even though many of the systems described in these patents never get built.

Biological Captcha

Based on what information is available, the system seems ideal for a system like Mechanical Turk, in which workers complete quick tasks — like helping train AI algorithms — for small sums of money.

The idea there, PC Mag reports, is to make the process of proving that someone actually did the work quick and painless — albeit intrusive — instead of taking up time they could spend on the next job.

Binance Coin (BNB)","Following rumors that North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong-Un is either in declining health or dead, reports started circulating that the country’s Bitcoin (BTC) reserves will be sold.

According to a March 2019 report, at the time North Korea already held about $670 million in crypto assets. Many believe this non-trivial amount of cryptocurrency to be under Jong-Un’s direct control.

Because recent reports have suggested that North Korea’s leader’s life is in danger after a failed heart surgery, many are afraid that the country’s crypto holdings may be sold, causing the price to drop.

Note, however, that many experts are now saying that there is no reason to believe that anything unusual is happening with Kim Jong-Un.

Jong-Un’s BTC dump: a joke turned rumor

Furthermore, market correspondent at crypto news outlet CoinDesk Zack Voell recently posted a joke on Twitter that has seen over a thousand likes, in which he claimed that Jong-Un’s Bitcoin was moved onto the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase.

At a later time, he deleted his tweet and explained his reasons in another message:

“I deleted the [...] tweet so people stop asking me for a tx hash and because some crypto media outlets are still taking it seriously. The stupidity in this industry is just incredible.”

As Voell’s tweet suggested, several cryptocurrency news outlets reported on how Jong-Un’s declining health can result in Bitcoin’s price, with some taking Voell’s now-deleted tweet seriously. At a later time, he tweeted:

“I can't believe I have to say this, but North Korea will not market dump all of their bitcoins (or monero) if Kim Jong-Un is actually dead.”

North Korea’s relationship with cryptocurrency

North Korea’s notorious secrecy means we do not have much confirmed information on the government’s use of cryptocurrencies. Still, as Cointelegraph reported in mid-March, blockchain forensics firm CipherTrace claimed in a report that two Chinese nationals laundered tens of millions of dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency on behalf of the North Korean regime.

In February, a study revealed that North Korea’s internet increased three times over the past three years, as the country’s regime has continued to rely on cryptocurrencies for various activities."
2020-04-28,"Bitcoin’s bulls are taking a breather, having engineered the longest run of daily gains since last summer.

At press time, the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading in a sideways manner around $7,730 on major exchanges, representing a 0.60 percent decline on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

The lackluster trading comes a day after prices hit a 6.5-week high of $7,800. Notably, the cryptocurrency has eked out modest gains in each of the last seven days. Bitcoin last rallied for seven straight days in July 2019.

Daily charts

The seven-day winning trend (above right) from July 30 to Aug. 5, 2019, saw prices rise by over $2,600 to highs near $12,000. While the upward move was bigger than the latest $1,000 rise from $6,800 to $7,800, it was short-lived and reversed in the following 10 days.

Meanwhile, most analysts are anticipating an extension of the recent uptrend, possibly to $10,000, in the days leading up to the mining reward halving, due on May 12.

Some observers, however, think the cryptocurrency could witness a pullback before breaking above $8,000 in a convincing manner.

“Feels like we have gone quite far over the last week and now there’s every chance of a small pullback (perhaps as far as to $7,000) over the course of the next few days,” Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk.

To make $8,000 a tough task, bitcoin is also approaching a cluster of resistance levels lined up in the $7,800 to $8,000 range.

Daily chart

To start with, the $7,800-$7,900 area has offered strong support and resistance over the last year. “Technically its quite a large resistance for bitcoin to break,” said Jones.

Further,

the 200- and 100-day averages are lined up at $7,978 and $7,973, respectively.

If these levels prove a tough nut to crack, the market may test dip demand, or buyers’ resolve to keep the upward trend on track, by revisiting support at $7,469 (April 7 high) and $7,300 (April 18 high).

Alternatively,

a high-volume move above $8,000 would shift the focus to the resistance of the

trendline connecting Feb. 13 and Feb. 18 highs at $8,275.

The odds of bitcoin rising to $10,000 ahead of halving, as suggested by Jehan Chu, co-founder at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic on Monday, would strengthen if the descending trendline resistance is breached.

4-hour chart

The 4-hour chart is reporting conflicting signals.

While the bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) indicates scope for a price pullback, the symmetrical triangle breakout confirmed on Monday suggests the path of least resistance is to the higher side.

Price patterns usually take precedence over indicators. However, in this case the odds of a pullback, as suggested by the RSI, look strong as the cryptocurrency has already failed twice to chew through resistance at $7,800.","Bitcoin Halving Theories: Whale Says Price Rise Is a ‘Nonsensical Narrative,’ Weiss Ratings Expects ‘Massive Crypto Superboom’

In less than two weeks, the Bitcoin block reward halving will take place and BTC miners will receive half the reward going forward after May 12. Since ‘Black Thursday’ (March 12), bitcoin prices have gained 103% since then rising from $3,800 to $7,750 per coin. With the halving fast approaching, many cryptocurrency proponents believe the event will create significant demand for the digital asset bringing the price back to all-time-highs.

The Great Bitcoin Halving

One of the most anticipated events in Bitcoin history is taking place on or around May 12, 2020. The event is called the “Bitcoin Halving,” and it means that the block reward miners receive for finding blocks on the BTC chain will see the reward slashed in half. When the BTC network first launched, miners got 50 BTC per block found, and in 2012 that reward changed to 25 coins per block. Then in July 2016, miners saw the second halving, which saw rewards cut in half from 25 coins to 12.5 BTC per block. In less than two weeks, the 12.5 coinbase reward will be chopped in half, and miners will only obtain 6.25 coins per block plus transaction fees. The reason this happens is because Satoshi Nakamoto created a mathematical and predictable system that encourages scarcity and savings.

On Tuesday, April 28 there are 18,349,900 BTC in circulation and there will only be 21 million BTC in existence after the last coin is mined. Between now and the halving, roughly 25,000 virgin coins will be obtained from mining before the event. BTC still has an inflation rate per annum of around 3.65% per day, with $13,923,540 worth issued per day. If prices were to remain the same as today, the $13 million will be chopped in half and the per annum inflation rate will drop to 1.8%. However, the 18.3 million BTC in circulation is not a correct representation of what’s really in circulation. Millions worth of BTC have been lost or stolen, and many investors are holding their BTC for dear life in hopes the price will spike higher. A good example of this trend stems from the data provided by Glassnode, which notes that 42.83% of all circulating BTC has not moved in at least two years. The Twitter account @cryptounfolded states that this figure has increased by 10.4% during the last 12 months.

‘Nonsensical Narratives’

Not everyone on ‘crypto Twitter’ has the high expectations that BTC prices will skyrocket after the halving. The well known bitcoin proponent on Twitter known as @joe007, told his 28,000 followers that he doesn’t believe the price will spike after the halving event. “No, of course, it’s not priced in,” he sarcastically tweeted. “On the very day of The Great Halvening, everybody will finally realize how underpriced BTC is, and they will all rush to buy it. In droves. With their unemployment checks.” Following @joe007’s tweet, many people didn’t care for his speculative attitude. He replied to them saying:

It’s one thing being bullish, quite another being drunk on hopium and buying into nonsensical narratives. Not that I care, really. Everyone is free to donate their money to the cause of their own choosing.

Weiss Ratings: ‘A Rare Trigger Event Is About to Unleash a New Cryptocurrency Superboom’

Despite the bitcoin pundit’s opinion, many other investors and think tanks believe the halving will catapult BTC’s price northbound. The founder of Weiss Ratings, Dr. Martin Weiss recently revealed his opinion of the aftereffect of BTC’s next halving. Weiss Ratings has been around for quite some time, and the researchers have developed a web portal called Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings. The website gives cryptocurrencies different grades like you would get in school from an A+ rating to an F. Weiss says historically, the BTC halving has “unleashed a historic bull market in cryptocurrencies, creating massive wealth for investors.”

The doctor further noted that leveraging the team’s “Crypto Timings Model” and “Crypto Ratings Model” would lead to avoiding low-rated cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency with an overall B+ rating would be the best crypto assets to research. Weiss explained that if Villaverde’s Crypto Timing Model existed years ago, anyone could have turned $1,000 into $1.5 billion by investing. For this halving event, Weiss stressed investors should purchase the “best” if Villaverde’s Crypto Timing Model says to buy and sell when the model indicates you should sell.

The report written by Dr. Martin Weiss states:

A rare event will soon trigger a massive cryptocurrency superboom, sending Bitcoin and other select coins to new, all-time highs.Because this trigger event is built right into the code. No government, no organization, and no group of individuals, no matter how rich or powerful can prevent this trigger from being pulled. And every time this event has occurred in the past, it has always unleashed a historic bull market in cryptocurrencies, creating massive wealth for investors.

When asked if the term “massive wealth” was an overstatement, Weiss said that it really wasn’t. “It’s actually an understatement,” the doctor replied. “If you bought bitcoin during the last trigger event, you could have multiplied your money more than 30-fold … turning every $10,000 invested into more than $300,000,” Weiss added.

Right now, in the eyes of many, the halving is a big deal but a lot of investors think it will be a non-event as well. Crypto proponents are also aware that there is a lot of money invested in stablecoins at the moment, as a decent amount of those funds could find their way into markets like ETH, BTC, or BCH. In the last 30 days, BTC prices are up 20% and the firm Tether has issued $1 billion stablecoins this past month. In fact, the USDT crypto market cap is half of the size of XRP’s market valuation, as USDT’s cap is steadily advancing toward the third-largest position.

In a new blog post, PlanB says the latest model takes into account the evolving narratives of Bitcoin over the last 10 years. He says that the cryptocurrency’s transition from one use case to another comes with certain “financial milestones.”

To illustrate his point, PlanB tracks Bitcoin’s changing narratives, from its early days as a proof of concept to its potential use as a means of payment and its emerging reputation as a digital form of gold and a financial instrument.

To predict the next phase of Bitcoin’s narrative, PlanB identifies the BTC phases as clusters, removes time from the equation and integrates silver and gold into the model.

“With the phase transition perspective of BTC clusters as different assets, I can now add other assets like silver and gold to the model. This makes it a real cross asset model. I call this new model the BTC S2F cross asset (S2FX) model. S2FX model enables valuation of different assets like silver, gold and BTC with one formula.”

With the new model complete, PlanB says Bitcoin’s predicted value by the end of 2024 is $288,000.

“S2FX model estimates a market value of the next BTC phase/cluster (BTC S2F will be 56 in 2020–2024) of $5.5T. This translates into a BTC price (given 19M BTC in 2020–2024) of $288K.

Solidifying known facts from the original S2F study, the S2FX model offers a new way of thinking about BTC transitioning into the fifth phase.”

Crypto analysts and influencers are divided on whether it makes sense to apply the stock-to-flow model, which is usually applied to precious metals, to a digital asset like Bitcoin. As for PlanB, the pseudonymous analyst has worked to steadily improve his S2F model, which divides the circulating supply of a commodity by its yearly production in order to track scarcity and forecast future value.

The new prediction that BTC could hit $288,000 is his third. PlanB’s original S2F model indicated Bitcoin would trade around $55,000 between 2020 to 2024. The second incarnation of the model showed the dominant cryptocurrency on track to hit $100,000 in the same time frame.","tBTC, an Ethereum-based token pegged to bitcoin, has begun its public launch. Over the next two weeks, the project will roll out its technical infrastructure with the support of over 40 crypto projects, including MakerDAO, Compound, and Uniswap.

The ERC-20 token is fully collateralized by bitcoin, meaning its supply is pegged to bitcoin's supply. The protocol is the product of a collaboration between Keep Network, an Ethereum-based system for privately storing data off-chain, and Summa, which provides tools for cross-chain communication.

On Monday, tBTC's developers launched the network's platform token, called KEEP, which is required to play the role of a ""signer."" Signers create and control smart contracts that take in bitcoin deposits and mint tBTC tokens. The team also released the smart contracts required for holding and staking assets.

As of now, signers will consist of project partners, employees, affiliates, and private purchasers like A16z and Polychain. According to tBTC project lead Matt Luongo, around 80 to 100 stakers will be ready to sign at tBTC's launch. In June, Keep will host a stakedrop event, through which anyone will be able to stake ETH to receive Keep tokens and become the protocol's signers.

Next week, the project will deploy the dashboard for the tBTC DApp and the remaining infrastructure.

On May 11, the whole tBTC system will be ready for public use. Anyone will be able to deposit limited funds into the DApp, although Luongo told The Block that users should ""take it slow"" since it will still be a new system.

There are a number of other projects – including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), ImToken's imBTC, Synthetix's sBTC – that try to bring Bitcoin liquidity to Ethereum. Each of these tokens allows bitcoin holders to access decentralized finance (DeFi) services through the Ethereum blockchain. What makes tBTC unique, however, is its clear path for redemption, which makes it relatively easy for users to get their bitcoins back if they want to.

With tBTC, users can go to the tBTC DApp, generate a bitcoin wallet address, deposit their bitcoin into that address, and the get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet. If they want their bitcoin back, they can redeem it on the DApp and send the bitcoin to their selected wallet address.

According to a statement to The Block, Compound and MakerDAO are both set to list tBTC on their platforms.

Luongo said that Compound has already integrated with tBTC on Ethereum test network Ropsten. He hopes that users will someday be able to take out USD loans with tBTC collateral using the lending protocol, but he also acknowledged that this will ultimately be up to Compound.

Indeed, Compound CEO Robert Leshner previously told The Block that they need to more accurately assess tBTC's liquidity and security after observing the token's mainnet performance before deciding whether it can become a collateral option.

The MakerDAO community, meanwhile, voted last week to whitelist tBTC and approve its ETH/BTC price oracle, meaning that Maker will maintain the price feed for tBTC. Maker also plans to eventually allow users to use tBTC to mint DAI stablecoin, according to Luongo. He said that the approval of the price feed is ""a huge step forward"" toward bringing bitcoin collateral to MakerDAO.

""The Maker team has been an excellent resource building tBTC, and we're pleased MKR holders just voted to deploy an ETH/BTC price feed to power tBTC,"" said Luongo. ""The inclusion of tBTC as collateral will be subject to a vote by MKR holders. Once they do that, we'll be off to the races.""

Besides MakerDao and Compound, tBTC's launch partners also include Uniswap, OasisDEX, Balancer, Kyber, Wyre, 1inch, and a number of other prominent projects.","Chinese Court Declares Ethereum Legal Property With Economic Value

A district court in China has reportedly ruled that Ethereum’s cryptocurrency is legal property with economic value. This ruling follows a couple of other verdicts on the legality of cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, by various Chinese courts. While cryptocurrency is not legal tender in China, people can hold and transfer them like property.

Court Ruling: ETH Is Legal Property in China

The Shenzhen Futian District People’s Court in Guangdong Province, China, has ruled that ether is legal property, protected by Chinese law, local media reported last week. This means that the Chinese are not barred from owning or transferring the cryptocurrency, local publication 8btc explained, adding that according to the court ruling:

The crypto assets represented by ETH have economic value and can be traded publicly.

Details of the Cryptocurrency Theft Case

The theft case involved a blockchain engineer, known by the name Li, who worked at a company called Shenzhen Xinyijia Technology Co. Ltd. in March last year. The following month, he participated in a project called “Haode Star,” a joint venture between his company and Shenzhen Haode Trade Co. Ltd., the plaintiff of the case. Li was in possession of the project’s private key and payment password.

He left his employer on May 31 last year after his probationary period ended. Unhappy with the termination, Li used the Haode Star project’s private key and payment password on June 20, 2019, to log into Haode Trade’s account at the cryptocurrency exchange platform Imtoken. He allegedly stole 3 ETH and 4 million Haode coins. The court also found that on July 15, 2019, Li stole an additional 0.4 ETH from the same account using the same credentials, the news outlet detailed. He proceeded to transfer the plaintiff’s cryptocurrency to his own accounts at Okex and Imtoken.

According to the transaction records provided by Haode Trade, the value of the supposedly stolen ETH was more than 6,000 Chinese yuan ($846). Li has returned all of the Haode coins and the 0.4 ETH he took. In addition to paying the plaintiff 5,536.99 yuan, he was sentenced to seven months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 2,000 yuan.

This is not the first time a Chinese court has ruled that cryptocurrency is property. In 2018, the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration ruled in favor of protecting an “equity transfer agreement” involving bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and bitcoin diamond. In the same year, the Shanghai Hongkou District Court found that ETH was property protected by Chinese law in the general legal sense. While China does not recognize the monetary properties of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ether, the court said at the time that “we cannot deny the fact that ether should be protected by law as a general property.”

Announced Tuesday, Armada sifts through banking indicators such as routing and account numbers in search of transactions that may present institutional risk including payments to crypto ATMs, which have been tied to money laundering.

Armada differs from many investigations programs in its focus on payments across established financial infrastructure. Many other crypto analytics tools – including those from CipherTrace – trace payments between wallet addresses as they scout out potential troublespots, bypassing the banks. Such programs often appeal to exchanges and law enforcement investigators.

In contrast, Armada is a tool for the banks. It “plugs into” their existing transaction monitoring systems, said John Jefferies, chief financial analyst for CipherTrace. There, it monitors illicit activity via machine learning, clustering algorithms and CipherTrace’s database of high-risk entities.

This “enables Armada to catch money services businesses (MSB) that may be obscuring their true nature through different names or hidden accounts,” said Vice President of Product Management Catherine Woneis.

CipherTrace offered the case of unlicensed bitcoin seller Kunal Kalra as an example of how Armada could be used. Kalra pled guilty last August to running an unlicensed crypto MSB for darknet drug dealers, using fake names, bank transfers to a Gemini account and an anonymous bitcoin ATM to exchange up to $25 million in cash and crypto total.

Kalra’s three-year campaign was ultimately busted by federal investigators. Armada would have flagged Kalra’s activity with the banks, CipherTrace said.

Jefferies said Armada will also help improve ties between legitimate VASPs and their bankers,","New data support the assertion that small bitcoin investors are multiplying rapidly. And anecdotal evidence suggests that much of the growth is taking place in the U.S.

The number of network addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC has continued to hit new all-time highs, climbing to 3,010,784 on Monday, according to data from Glassnode. At the time of publication, 0.1 BTC is worth $770.

These addresses began to increase exponentially around mid-February, coinciding with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s suggestion to lawmakers that the central bank lacked sufficient firepower to fight the next recession.

Inferring definite conclusions about market activity from on-chain metrics is difficult. A user can control multiple addresses, for example, so not every new address represents a new investor. Also, the number of bitcoin wallets with at least 0.1 BTC has grown gradually but consistently after dipping significantly during early 2018, according to Glassnode.

But several U.S.-based bitcoin investment services corroborate the idea that the number of small bitcoin investors is growing at an increased rate.

First-time buyers

Swan Bitcoin, a bitcoin investment service based in Los Angeles that “launched in the middle of the COVID-19 panic” has seen “strong uptake” in customers who save “over $300 per month” in bitcoin on average, with some “measuring well into the thousands,” said Yan Pritzker, its co-founder and CTO.

Recently, “a number of Swan customers started raising their [bitcoin] purchase plans,” Pritzker said.

In bitcoin parlance, these users are “stacking sats” – a sat, or satoshi, being the smallest unit of the currency recorded on the blockchain, 0.00000001 BTC.

River Financial, a bitcoin brokerage based in San Francisco, has seen significant growth in customers buying “hundreds to a couple thousand dollars worth of bitcoin,” said Alexander Leishman, its founder and CEO.

“The number of orders on our platform doubled in mid-March, and it has since sustained a significantly elevated rate.” he said. “Many of our clients have directly told me that they are buying bitcoin because the government is printing so much money. A lot of these people are buying bitcoin for the first time.”

Stimulus spending?

Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, shared a cryptic chart earlier in April indicating a spike in the number of Coinbase customers who deposit and execute buy orders for $1,200, the same amount in the stimulus checks sent by the Internal Revenue Service to middle- and lower-income adults. Coinbase is the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange by traded volume, according to data aggregator CoinGecko.

When Armstrong tweeted the Coinbase customer data, $1,200 was worth roughly 0.17 BTC.","Bitcoin price is trading in negative territory, down 0.50% in the second half of the session. BTC/USD bulls are running at seven straight days in the green, as the move higher continues. The next major barrier is viewable at the psychological $8000 mark.

Ethereum price is trading in the red by 0.35% in the session on Tuesday. ETH/USD is consolidating just underneath the big $200 price mark. Should the bulls push above the noted level, it will likely restore buyer confidence.

Litecoin price is trading in negative territory by 0.45 % in the session on Tuesday. LTC/USD is a small step away from an explosive move north, barrier at $45. A return back into the $50 territory could quickly be seen and restoring buyer faith.

2020-04-29,"There’s an old saying on Wall Street that financial markets are driven by two emotions, fear and greed. In the crypto markets, the driver is often a combination of the two: fear of missing out.

The FOMO, as it’s often called, looked strong Wednesday as bitcoin jumped to its highest levels in nearly two months, rising as high as $8,900 while a buoyant stock market shrugged off bad economic data.

At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up an eye-catching 14% over 24 hours at $8,851, well above the 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages, signaling extreme bullish sentiment.

Crypto stakeholders continue to talk up the upcoming halving, an event that happens as often as the Olympic games or a U.S. presidential election, and for many bitcoiners is more important than either.

Around May 12, the amount of new bitcoin mined every 10 minutes or so will drop by 50%, a regular scheduled adjustment that was followed by price increases in 2012 and 2016. Possibly in anticipation of history repeating, in the past five days bitcoin has logged 21% price appreciation.

“The media coverage of the halving over the last five months, combined with continually increasing Google search volume for ‘bitcoin halving’, suggests that we may see similar FOMO around the upcoming halving event,” said Danny Kim, head of revenue for crypto liquidity provider SFOX.

Beyond any herd mentality, market participants noted the environment today is very different than during the first two halvings.

“This halving is taking place in a much more volatile, uncertain macroeconomic environment than all past events,” said Charles Cascarilla, CEO of stablecoin provider Paxos.

Exchange outages

Trading activity spiked Wednesday, nearly overwhelming servers at U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, which suffered brief outages.

The S&P 500 index climbed 2.6% in trading Wednesday despite poor GDP numbers showing the world’s largest economy contracted for the first time in six years.

Stocks’ ascent helps bitcoin but there’s likely a limit to the upside, said Josh Rager, a crypto trader and founder of learning platform Blackroots.

“Personally, I don’t know if bitcoin can hit $10,000 but I think as long as the stock market performs well it will continue to have a positive impact on bitcoin,” Rager said.

March’s market bloodbath led to volatility in the S&P 500: Three top-20 record low days and two top-20 record high days in performance for the index that month.

However, April has been all about rebounding for the S&P 500 as government stimulus measures abound. More coronavirus relief is expected to be on the way with U.S. first-quarter annualized GDP numbers down 4.8%, the first quarter-to-quarter decline since 2014.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it would hold benchmark U.S. interest rates close to zero while pledging to continue buying assets in an unbounded amount to help keep global markets functioning smoothly.

The central bank, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, said it would maintain the target range for its short-term lending rate at 0% to 0.25%, “until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price-stability goals.”

The Bitcoin Association (BA) also says that BSV transaction processors (the digital currency’s miners) are able to earn better returns than those who support the much more established Bitcoin (BTC) network.

The BA noted in its latest report that the Bitcoin SV scaling test network (testnet) had “consistently sustained 1,300 transactions per second for a prolonged period, in addition to handling a peak load of 6,400 transactions per second.”

The report added:

“To put the transaction capacity in perspective, the VISA network, which has long been viewed as the gold-standard for payment processors, handles an average of 1,700 transactions per second.”

It further mentioned that the Bitcoin SV testnet has managed to process blocks of nearly 2 GB in size, which reportedly contained a total of 7.877 million transactions.

Bitcoin SV (BSV) and BCH have forked from the original BTC protocol due to differences in how developers and their communities want to scale and make further updates to the open-source Bitcoin protocol.

BCH and BSV community members want to scale Bitcoin far beyond what the BTC developers aim to achieve (on-chain). Most BTC developers support layer-two scalability solutions such as the Lightning Network (LN), however, many members of the crypto community are critical of this approach as they claim that Bitcoin should be scaled on-chain. Otherwise, they argue that it’s not really Bitcoin that’s being scaled, as it’s just another separate network that’s processing transactions, which might not have been what Satoshi wanted.

The annual report from the BA covers the time period from February of last year to February 2020. It claims that BSV provides better returns in the form of transaction fees than other versions of Bitcoin.

The report states:

“Bitcoin SV is emerging as the most profitable Bitcoin network for transaction processors (miners) to be working on, offering better returns than BTC on the majority of days from September 2019 to February 2020.”

According to data from Messari, the Bitcoin SV network only generated $255 in transaction fees during the past 24 hours (for its miners). Meanwhile, the much larger and more secure (due to network effects and other sound technical design choices) Bitcoin (BTC) network generated $214,199 in transaction fees, according to Messari’s calculations.

It remains unclear exactly how the BA came to its conclusions in its recent report.

During an interview with Crowdfund Insider, Steve Shadders, the CTO at nChain, a company focused on BSV development, explained why he (and the Bitcoin SV community) believe that their version of Bitcoin is the “real” iteration of the pseudonymous digital currency.

Shadders noted:

“Simply because the stated goal of the project is to restore Bitcoin to the original design described by Satoshi and lock it down in that state. To that end we have studied the whitepaper, the original code and later statements of Satoshi to try and understand it better. It is very clear that Bitcoin was always intended to scale massively on chain. Aside from the fact Satoshi himself said it directly there are obvious clues:

1) The first implementation implement direct IP2IP communication between peers

2) The whitepaper describes lightweight SPV clients interacting at the edge of the core miner network

3) The script language contains an op code enabling 4GB of data to be pushed to the stack.

4) There are fundamental incentives built into the system that give advantages to competitive miners that continuously invest in increasing their capacity.

This scaling is necessary for it to become useful on a global scale rather than a technical curiosity.”

Responding to a question about what the short- and long-term goals of the Bitcoin SV project are, Shadders said:

“Ultimately, to deliver a Blockchain that is capable of servicing the global population as a commodity ledger of transaction history. The first step is finalize the protocol in a state as close as possible to the original design. That work was substantially completed with the Genesis upgrade in February but some small changes will require one more hard fork to complete.

The second step is deliver a software implementation capable of horizontal scaling. We call the project Teranode and currently building prototypes. The design workshops for Teranode have been very informative.

We picked apart every process flow in Bitcoin at a detailed level to come up with an architecture that does not rely on any central coordination. What we found was there is nothing in Bitcoin’s design that is not fundamentally parallelizable. It’s almost as if the design carefully considered the future scaling needs and baked parallelism right into the protocol.”

When asked about why Bitcoin SV developers say that bigger block sizes will allow more transactions to be processed in a shorter period of time and at more affordable costs, and how this could potentially compromise the cryptocurrency network’s level of decentralization, Shadders remarked:

“‘Decentralization’ is a word that is often used in Bitcoin circles but rarely is it clearly defined. The whitepaper (quoted) makes the goal of Bitcoin clear which is to replace the need for a ‘trusted central authority’ with the Bitcoin network itself in order to enable ‘any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.’

A common misconception is that this property requires a large number of nodes. But what matters is nodes that can take action to enforce the Bitcoin rules. Miners write to the Blockchain. If you are running the bitcoin daemon and receive a dishonest block with an invalid transaction in it, you can’t do anything to sanction the miner that produced that block except for mine a competing block.

It doesn’t matter if there 3 miners or 3 million, it matters that the majority of hashpower acts honestly because if they do then an invalid block will be orphaned and no one will waste the resources to try. Mining is a huge investment and it makes no rational sense to go against the majority, as it will always be harmful to your investment. In fact the larger the investment the more a miner has to lose by attempting to go against the majority so arguably the larger a miner is the more incentivised they are act honestly.

If you define decentralization as the number of nodes on the network, people might be surprised to hear that the number of actual nodes (those that are mining blocks) isn’t very different between BTC and Bitcoin SV. Although it’s not as simple as that because each node may service many actual miners via mining pools.”

During the interview, Shadders had said that it would be a good idea to tokenize fiat currencies or traditional assets on the Bitcoin SV network.

He explained:

“The Bitcoin blockchain can be used as a base carrier layer for any application that requires an immutable, ordered record of events. Fiat transactions are an example of this. It is fast, cheap and efficient, it has global reach and offers features that current transaction processing facilities do not so it’s a no brainer that central banks are exploring the idea of tokenizing their currencies.

I think this is a likely a pathway to further adoption of Bitcoin. Fiat is well understood by consumers and business alike so the psychological barrier to entry is lower and when the utility is demonstrated it will be easy to get people using it. In the process they’ll also be using Bitcoin even if they don’t realise it.

Fast forward a decade or two and with high utility, the price of Bitcoin should stabilize since it’s underpinned by something of substance. At this point, people will start to realize that transacting in the native Bitcoin token is even more efficient and therefore cheaper.”","Market Outlook: Crypto Market Prices Rally Ahead of Bitcoin Halving, BTC Up $1K in 24 Hours

Cryptocurrency markets are bullish on April 29, as BTC prices have spiked over 11.8% in the last 24 hours touching a high of $8,740 per coin during Wednesday’s trading sessions. Bitcoin has gained 130% in value since the market rout on March 12 otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday.’ Many believe the cause behind the higher price is due to the pending Bitcoin Halving expected to take place on or around May 12, 2020.

Bitcoin Markets Jump Significantly in Value, $1K in a Day

The overall market valuation today for all 5,000 crypto assets in existence is roughly around $251 billion (1/4 of a trillion) and BTC’s market cap captures $153 billion of that number. Slowly and steadily, BTC prices have continued to rise during the last week breaking past a few crucial resistance zones. At press time, the price per BTC is around $8,639 per coin and the crypto asset is up over 11%. BTC is up 21% for the last seven days, 35% for the last 30 days, and 60% for the year so far. 90-day statistics show that BTC is still down around 8% with today’s prices.

ETH prices are up around 10% as well and each ether is swapping for $215 per coin. XRP still holds the third-largest market cap and each XRP is valued around $0.22 at the time of publication. Tether is hopping back and forth with bitcoin cash (BCH) markets and is currently the fifth largest crypto market valuation today.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH/USD) Market Action

Bitcoin cash (BCH) is selling for $258 per coin and is up 7.5% for the day. For the last seven days, BCH is up 11% and 17% for the last 30 days. The top trading pair with bitcoin cash on Wednesday is tether (USDT) with 57% of BCH trades. This is followed by BTC (25%), GBP (6.9%), USD (3%), KRW (2.6%), and ETH (1.42%) pairs. GBP’s increase has been notable as it is unusual to be above USD and even EUR trading pairs. BCH is currently in the midst of heavier resistance and its gonna take some bullish pressure to break the $275-300 zones.

BTC Price Headed to $13K

A popular digital currency trader named @Galaxy told his 62,000 Twitter followers: “The fact that BTC is going to $13K simply cannot be ignored. Of course, many of the people who responded to Galaxy didn’t believe his price prediction. Some traders responding said another big correction is coming and others expect prices around $5K. Meanwhile, plenty of individuals could imagine $100-200K per BTC prices. “I never understand people day trading bitcoin. Just hold until it’s $100K and sell a little. Repeat at $200K. It’s easy,” another individual tweeted in response to Galaxy’s tweet.

Bitfinex Cold Wallets Are Being Siphoned

Just recently news.Bitcoin.com reported on the massive withdrawals that crypto proponents have witnessed since the Black Thursday market massacre. According to a report written by Anton Lucian, Bitfinex cold wallets are draining significantly. “57,000 BTC ($441M) has been withdrawn from Bitfinex’s cold wallet in the past 70 days,” Lucian detailed. “This is one of the rare times the exchange’s cold wallet has seen a drop in holdings for an extended period of time. BTC withdrawals on the exchange in the past 30 days are also more than 10x higher compared to other exchanges,” the author added.

Fed Induced Crypto Pump

Some crypto proponents wholeheartedly believe that the jump above $8K per BTC today was due to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Powell told the public that the Federal Reserve will be keeping interest rates at zero and he discussed a number of stimulus plans. What really triggered the spike and even a rise in equity markets is when Powell’s Fed proposal disclosed that the money has no requirements.

“Unlike other portions of the relief for American businesses, however, this aid [from the Fed] will be exempt from rules passed by Congress requiring recipients to limit dividends, executive compensation, and stock buybacks and does not direct the companies to maintain certain employment levels,” explains the Washington Post. “Critics say the program could allow large companies that take federal help to reward shareholders and executives without saving any jobs. The program was set up jointly by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department,” the financial news outlet added.

Bitcoin rallied 12% to $8,703 as of 19:30 UTC (3:30 p.m. Eastern time). The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 3.1%.

In terms of year-to-date performance, bitcoin’s returns increased to 20%, surging past gold’s 12%. Many cryptocurrency investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold, which could theoretically be a long-term consequence of central-bank money injections. Deutsche Bank estimates that central bank balance sheets have expanded by some $3.7 trillion just since the start of March.

The Fed, led by Chair Jerome Powell, said it would keep benchmark U.S. interest rates close to zero while reiterating a pledge to continue buying U.S. Treasury bonds and other assets in an unbounded amount to keep global markets functioning smoothly. Some economists had speculated the central bank might announce plans to start tapering the asset purchases, which along with emergency-lending programs have ballooned the Fed’s balance sheet past $6.5 trillion for the first time in its 107-year history.

“It’s clear that the effects on the economy are severe,” Powell said during a press conference Wednesday. Reporters, based remotely, dialed into the event via a group video call. “We won’t run out of money. It’s an unlimited pot.”

The Fed’s announcements came after a report from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis earlier Wednesday showing that gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 4.8% during the first quarter as government issued stay-at-home orders. The report provided what economists described as the first official data confirming that the country is sliding into a recession.

Powell, in his press conference, warned that second-quarter economic data will reveal the “unprecedented” damage from the coronavirus.

Bitcoin’s rally was likely abetted by “fear of missing out,” or FOMO, on the part of traders, said Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency research firm.

“Buying begets more buying,” he said.

We won't run out of money. It's an unlimited pot.

Bitcoin tumbled 11 percent during the first quarter of 2020, but the price has soared since the start of April.","New analysis of the top 10,000 Ether wallet addresses certainly paints a very bullish picture for Ethereum as it moves towards Proof-of-Stake consensus. However, it also suggests that some highly questionable practices are being employed by certain major cryptocurrency exchanges and Ether (ETH) whale accounts.

The Poloniex/Tron axis

According to the report’s author, Adam Cochran, when Circle bought Poloniex back in February 2018, it moved assets into better cold wallets and had strong reserves. However, when the exchange was acquired by a group that included Tron’s Justin Sun, it is speculated that some of these cold wallets were drained to become fractional reserves.

The wallets appear to have only been drained into exchanges listing Tron (TRX). This coincided with an increase in Tron buying activity and a 50% pump in token price.

While this may simply have been Poloniex cross-market trading on other exchanges, Cochran questions whether the exchange’s purchase by Sun was actually just a scheme to boost the price of Tron.

A Tron spokesperson told Cointelegraph that Cochran’s analysis was incorrect and contained ‘falsifications’. The spokesperson said the claim that cold wallets were drained “did not happen”, nor did Sun invest in Poloniex in order to increase the price of Tron.

Bitfinex in on market manipulation?

Cochran also highlights the methods used by a group of at least 12 whale accounts. These accounts seem to manipulate the market in coordination with Bitfinex and possibly also BitMEX.

Firstly, short positions on Ether increase, starting on Bitfinex then spreading to BitMEX and others. This is followed by an influx of ETH onto exchanges, sent in small batch transfers to avoid detection by systems like WhaleAlerts.

When the market dumps, the whales profit on their shorts and buy back the ETH at a lower price.

The most controversial claim by Cochran is that cold wallets belonging to Bitfinex appear to get in on the dumping action around 40% of the time.

Bitfinex used user-funds to sway ProgPoW vote

Another allegation against Bitfinex concerned the use of user-funds to vote for the move to Programmatic Proof-of-Work (ProgPoW). Before the vote, Bitfinex moved 1.17 million ETH between cold and hot wallets in order to get behind ProgPoW.

As only about 3 million ETH in total was involved in the voting process, this suggests that Bitfinex represented over 40% of the vote. According to Cochran, this shows that the community was not actually behind ProgPoW, which was being pushed by big self-interested parties.

Haters gonna profit and stealth exchanging

Ethereum often finds itself at the sharp end of disinformation campaigns on Twitter. Occasionally these spikes have an effect on price. With that in mind, Cochran mapped whale transfers to tweet volume and sentiment related to ETH. While most whales moved money to exchanges after a social media spike amidst anti-ETH rhetoric, a handful made transfers before the spike.

In fact, this handful of whales managed to preempt the negative sentiment peaks on Twitter an astonishing 86.7% of the time. Which rather suggests that the same whales might be behind the FUD.

Finally, Cochran notes that Coinbase is rather stealthy and does more to obfuscate transactions to and from the exchange. It does this through a mix of changing wallets and mixing funds in a way that the majority of exchanges do not.

In contrast to the other highlighted exchange behaviours, many users will be happy to know that Coinbase employs this tactic.

The ERC-20 compliant token is fully collateralized by BTC, which means its supply is pegged to Bitcoin’s circulating supply.

The tBTC protocol has been developed through a collaborative effort between Summa, a platform that offers software for cross-chain communication, and the Keep Network, an Ethereum-powered solution for privately and securely storing data off-chain (off the blockchain).

On April 27, 2020, the developers of tBTC introduced the network’s native token, KEEP, which has to take the role of a “signer.”

Signers are tasked with issuing and managing smart contracts that accept deposits in BTC and then create tBTC tokens. The tBTC development team also published the smart contracts needed for holding and staking digital assets.

Signers may include employees, affiliates, and project partners. They also include private buyers such as VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Polychain Capital.

Matt Luongo, the project lead at tBTC, claims that about 80 to 100 stakers will be prepared to sign when tBTC’s officially launches.

In June 2020, Keep will conduct an stakedrop event, which will allow people to stake their Ether in order to earn Keep tokens and also become the tBTC protocol’s signers.

The project will release the dashboard for the tBTC (decentralized application) dApp and other tech infrastructure.

On May 11, 2020, the entire tBTC platform will be accessible to the general public.

People will have the option of depositing a limited amount of assets into the dApp. Luongo recommends “taking it slow,” as it will be a brand new system that hasn’t been thoroughly tested over an extended period of time.

tBTC allows users to create a Bitcoin wallet through their tBTC dApp, deposit their BTC to that particular address, and then receive newly minted tBTC tokens, which are sent to their Ethereum wallets. If users want to redeem their Bitcoins, they can do so via the dApp, and then they can send the funds to any crypto wallet address.","In brief 66% of European believe that cryptocurrencies will still exist in ten years’ time according to a survey by bitFlyer Europe.

The highest level of confidence was in Italy, with 72%.

Across Europe, confidence in cryptocurrencies has increased 3% versus 2019 survey results.

Two-thirds of people in Europe believe that cryptocurrencies will still exist in ten years’ time, according to a survey of 10,000 citizens by Bitcoin exchange bitFlyer Europe.

Its annual Crypto-Confidence Index for 2020, published today, also found that Italians are the biggest believers, at 72%—while the UK is the least confident at 56%.

Impact of the coronavirus crisis

The survey was conducted in March, as panic about the COVID-19 pandemic was at its height. Countries introduced quantitative easing, and volatility hit the value of assets—both traditional and digital. Around this time, stocks were falling and the price of Bitcoin dropped 50% from $9,000 to $4,500.

Despite this, confidence in cryptocurrencies across Europe has increased 3% versus the 2019 results. Respondents in nine out of the ten countries polled were more confident.

Italy has the most believers

At the start of the outbreak, Italy was badly hit by the coronavirus. It was one of the first countries to see widespread lockdowns in place as the country struggled to deal with it. It also saw a fall in confidence in the European Union’s willingness to help its struggling economy.

This may help to explain why Italy has the biggest proportion of citizens (12%) which believes that cryptocurrencies will one day be used as mainstream currency, a two percent increase from last year.

Conversely, only five percent of UK respondents believe in the potential of cryptocurrencies as mainstream currencies.

Notably, the UK is the only country, other than Norway, in which population confidence in the future of cryptocurrencies decreased, and neither country relies on the Euro.

“Countries like Italy which have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis are expressing more faith than ever in cryptocurrencies,” said Andy Bryant, chief operating officer at bitFlyer Europe. “As people face economic hardship, we can expect populations to seek alternatives to traditional financial systems. This is an important time for the crypto industry to demonstrate how cryptocurrencies and associated concepts such as decentralized finance can provide attractive alternatives or even substitutes for incumbent economic models.”

The March 2020 poll also found that almost one in 10 (nine percent) of Europeans believe Bitcoin will be fully ingrained into society as a form of currency in 10 years’ time, whilst nine percent believe it will be used as a security or investment. A quarter of those polled were unsure how cryptocurrencies might be used in the future.

The Bitflyer survey appears to contradict a recent survey from Austria’s ING Bank, conducted in August, which found weakening confidence in Bitcoin (with the exception of Turkey).

But it’s Italy where citizens seem most receptive to cryptocurrencies. And the search for non-traditional currencies has already started.

Earlier this week, a small Italian town even began minting banknotes called Ducatis in a bid to help struggling locals.

Castellino del Biferno, in the mountainous north of the country, has just 550 residents. It’s handing the ‘Ducati’ notes out to residents based upon their economic needs, and is targeting the elderly—identified as the group needing the most help understanding the new currency.

Maybe that will help them understand Bitcoin, if the need arises.","Drawbacks of Cryptocurrency Exchanges - How Non-Custodial Services Like ChangeNOW Are the Solution

sponsored

Cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms where one can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies. The aim of crypto exchanges is to connect buyers and sellers by creating a cycle of supply and demand in one place.

Centralized vs Decentralized Exchanges

However, almost every exchange is prone to hacking, has privacy issues, and users could end up losing their funds. Non-custodial exchange services look to overcome these shortcomings of cryptocurrency exchanges.

Online cryptocurrency exchanges can be categorized into two types: centralized and decentralized.

Centralized exchanges allow you to sign up with your email and password and usually have extra security features like two-step authentication or email verification.

Even though they make it easier for everyday users to buy and sell digital assets with their interactive interface, one major downside of such exchanges is that they do not give users full control of their cryptocurrencies. The private keys of your wallets are held with the exchanges, so if they were to get hacked, your funds will be lost.

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) give users more control over their assets as they only act as intermediaries and do not store private keys giving the users full control of their funds. However, these exchanges come up with their own drawbacks such as low liquidity, slow UI, and not being able to handle huge amounts of transactions, etc. There are a very few DEXs compared to CEXs owing to the difficulty that users face while using the former due to complex UI. This is where an instant crypto exchange comes in – users can instantly trade their digital currencies in just 3 simple steps without the hassle of needing to register or worrying constantly about security.

Generally, people prefer CEX over a DEX because of a number of reasons like liquidity, volume, user-friendly platforms, etc. Top centralized exchanges like Bitfinex, Bittrex, Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Huobi have 99% of the transaction volume and were the first to exist in the market even before the idea of decentralized exchanges came up, so they have an upper hand of being in the market since inception.

Drawbacks of cryptocurrency exchanges

Cryptocurrency exchanges come with their own set of disadvantages, the major drawbacks include:

Privacy: Exchanges store all your information such as IP address, email, and details about your transactions which basically doesn’t leave behind much privacy for you.

Data Breaches: With increased KYC/AML policies by exchanges due to local regulations, security breaches have risen sharply. In fact, over 10000 Binance users’ personal data was stolen in 2019 with the hacker demanding 300 BTC threatened to release the photos which included driving licenses, passports, and face scans of users.

Loss of funds: The majority of the exchanges have had a story of getting hacked and users losing their hard-earned money. The bigger picture is explained in detail in the next paragraph.

The cumulative money lost from just the top three biggest exchange hacks in the last 7 years is over 1 Billion US Dollars, now imagine what the figures would look like if we consider all the hacks. Below is a picture that summarizes the money lost in all major hacks until April 2018.

Source: https://howmuch.net/articles/biggest-crypto-hacks-scams

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of daily volume, Binance, which is known for its innovative products and strong leadership went through a security breach in May 2019 which resulted in 7000 Bitcoins being stolen from their platform. Even though all the affected customers were reimbursed in this case, it shows how vulnerable it is to leave your money on exchanges.

“Your keys, your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.’’

– Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin and security entrepreneur

Cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts started trending hashtags such as “ProofOfKeys” on Twitter after major exchange breaches to ensure investors and traders stay away from custodial wallets and not store their cryptocurrency on exchanges unless they are trading. Non-custodial cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets started to gain traction as users gave much more priority to their security.

Also, trading on exchanges is not only risky but also a tedious task. In order for you to trade on a DEX, you need to enter your private keys or Keystore or use MetaMask; the latter is the most recommended method. Then you need to send your digital currency from your private wallet to Metamask and then to DEX. Every transaction has to be signed by you. Probably the most frustrating part of using this type of exchange is you have to wait until someone buys or sells so that your order fills, which can take a long time depending on the liquidity on that exchange.

CEXs solve this waiting problem by using market makers, but again, users are required to log in and perform authentication to trade and confirm by email to make every withdrawal. On top of all this, all exchanges require you to do KYC to comply with local regulations, which can take days.

Overcoming CEXs’ and DEXs’ drawbacks

Instant crypto exchange services that require no registration and perform your transactions fast may be the solution. These platforms give you basically as many options as any regular exchange – but overcome their shortcomings.

Another major advantage of such platforms over CEXs and DEXs is that they do not control your funds at all – as non-custodial services, they allow you to keep the keys to your crypto privately. An as there’s no registration required, the crypto exchange is very simple here. For example, on ChangeNOW, all you have to do to buy Bitcoin is to enter the amount of the sum you want to exchange, your wallet address, and to click Confirm.

Along with this, there are several other features that widen the possibilities of a trader on ChangeNOW. For example, they have no upper limits for the crypto exchange; over 200 cryptocurrencies are supported, and it’s possible to buy them with Visa or MasterCard. The rates are very reasonable as the service claims it uses special algorithms that pick the best rate at the moment of the exchange.

So what’s the best place to trade crypto?

Of course, there is no ideal platform to trade crypto out there. ChangeNOW has its own drawbacks – they have no crypto-to-fiat options available, and fiat-to-crypto exchanges are a bit pricy. Many traders consider instant exchange services the best place to trade crypto with security and convenience – but we recommend you doing your own research to choose the best platform that will fit your needs.

India: unprecedented growth in cryptocurrencies

“At a time when we are witnessing unprecedented growth in the use of cryptocurrencies in India, there is a need to provide users with an extensive range of crypto-based financial services that can ensure the faster, simpler, and uninterrupted flow of capital. We are thrilled that CRO is entering India, through our platform, which will help nearly 1.3 billion people in crypto trade CRO through INR. This is also an amazing opportunity for us to encourage more people to enter the crypto market through our ongoing #TryCrypto initiative,” says Sumit Gupta, CEO and Co-Founder of CoinDCX.

While the MCO token features key payment and finance utilities within the Crypto.com ecosystem, the CRO token is primarily used for settlements on the Crypto.com Chain, enabling transactions worldwide between merchants and cryptocurrency users in a seamless, secure and cost-efficient way.

“By using CRO as an intermediary currency on the Crypto.com Chain, participants can convert their cryptocurrencies to their fiat counterparts at a much-reduced cost,” Neeraj Khandelwal, Co-Founder of CoinDCX, says. “The combination of MCO and CRO creates a full-service, global system that encourages the adoption of cryptocurrencies that is inspired by real-life use cases,” he adds.

In 2019, the CRO token and the Crypto.com Chain project have made headlines based on the token’s dramatic price increases which propelled it to the top 50 position on the CoinMarketCap’s ranking.

Growth after banking ban lift

The listing of MCO and CRO on CoinDCX follows the successful closing of CoinDCX’s $3 million Series A funding round by Polychain Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, as well as HDR Group, Operator of BitMEX.

Following the lifting of an industry-wide banking ban by the Reserve Bank of India in February, the crypto exchange witnessed a 10 times growth in sign-ups in one week. It also launched its long-term campaign entitled #TryCrypto, pledging a sum of $1.3 million USD to bring about crypto mainstream adoption and the total number of crypto users in India to 50 million."
2020-04-30,"Bad U.S. jobless data pulled markets lower Thursday, affecting even bitcoin. But there may be a silver lining for the cryptocurrency.

At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was up just 1% over 24 hours at $8,864, with 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages converging, thus signaling sideways sentiment. After bitcoin prices jumped to their highest levels in nearly two months, up as much as $9,478 on Coinbase in early trading Thursday, dismal unemployment numbers cut the gains down to size.

Increasing unemployment is causing investors increasing concern. Another 3.8 million Americans filed for jobless claims this week, bringing the total to 30 million in the past six weeks after the coronavirus pandemic significantly slowed economic activity.

Staggering levels of unemployment loom over the U.S. economy Source: CNBC

The hits just keep on coming for the U.S. economy. The unemployment data came a day after GDP numbers showed the worst U.S. economic output since 2014. While Wednesday’s dismal economic data didn’t give markets a reality check, it was a different story when it came to showing how many people are out of work. The S&P 500 index slipped 1% Thursday. Europe’s FTSE Eurotop 100 index of largest companies in Europe also closed down, by 2.3%.

A bright side

But Catherine Coley, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance US, sees a bright side to the bitcoin dip. She thinks the poor economic data may give some investors an incentive to investigate more closely – and then buy – cryptocurrencies. “With unemployment and stimulus funding flooding our system, I think more people are looking for an alternative exposure to a market that’s unrelated” to U.S. dollars, Coley said.

Alex Mashinsky, CEO of digital asset lender Celsius Network, said he’s seen retail investors getting more curious about crypto. “Many first-time retail investors are flocking to bitcoin as a way to protect their wealth,” he said.

“Governments around the world are implementing unprecedented fiscal stimulus, which risks causing high inflation across fiat currencies, which reinforces bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset,” added Mashinsky.

But investing in bitcoin is not without risk and Mostafa Al-Mashita of Secure Digital Markets, a Canadian crypto brokerage firm, sees rocky times for bitcoin ahead despite its long-term potential. “We will continue to see volatility increase for the next eight weeks as the market finds a fair market value for bitcoin based on the supply and demand of the asset,” he said.

Some of this volatility has funds like Singapore-based QCP Capital carefully weighing their next moves in the spot crypto market. “We remain core long bitcoin and short puts, but have now turned cautious on our spot holdings,” QCP wrote in a Wednesday analysis note.

Al-Mashita said price volatility could continue as miners affect the market, particularly the spot market where they sell bitcoin mining rewards to pay required expenses in cash like rent, labor and electricity. “The volatility will be greater than ever as the hashrate difficulty adjusts before and after the halvening is complete,” he added.

Bitcoin network hashrate has been rising as the May 12 halving approaches. Some analysts and observers forecast a reduction in computing power used once the network’s reward reduction occurs.

Bitcoin halving-related FOMO, or “fear of missing out” as it’s often called, was likely stirred up Wednesday when bitcoin’s price rose 13% in 24-hour trading at one point. More frenzy is expected as the bitcoin halving event gets closer, according to Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.

“For bitcoin, I think we’re going to see some more FOMO here ahead of the halving, then maybe some sharp sell-off straight after the event. Then, a climb through the second half of the year,” Thomas said.

Other Markets

Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board performed poorly Thursday, with most in the red. The second-largest coin by market cap, ether (ETH), briefly hit $227 on spot exchanges like Coinbase, a high not seen since early March. Ether lost 1.7% in 24-hour trading as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

Digital asset losers in trading include tron (TRON) dipping 5.5%, eos (EOS) dropping 5% and iota (IOTA) in the red 3.8%. All price changes were as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

In commodities, oil again experienced a bump Thursday, up 23% as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

U.S. Treasury bonds climbed Thursday. Yields, which move in the opposite direction as price, were mixed, with yields on the 2-year down 10 percent.","Digital assets and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and XRP have often been called highly volatile and risky assets used by either speculators or dubious characters for dark web anonymous transactions facilitating illegal activities. Bitcoin has been around for over ten years at this point and it has proven to be useful for more than just speculation, and when it comes to using it for illegal transactions, it is not a clever solution to use a payment where the payment history is ending up on a permanent blockchain freely accessible.

The industries and companies that are developing technology using blockchain are now numbering in the thousands, and with more and more incentive to solve problems with fiat currencies, the industry is set to expand exponentially in the coming years. A fundamental difference between regular fiat currencies like the dollar, and bitcoin, is that the dollar is an inflationary currency that loses value over time due to money printing. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a deflationary currency with a fixed, limited total supply.

Another characteristic of bitcoin besides the limited supply is the periodic halving of the reward handed out to miners processing transactions on the network and in turn increase the security of it. Currently, miners are rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins per block of transactions confirmed on the network, after the halving the reward will be reduced to 6.25 bitcoins per block. The next bitcoin halving is scheduled to happen on May 12, and investors are expecting that the digital asset will see new all-time highs as there will be a smaller supply of newly created Bitcoins.

When bitcoin halvings have happened historically, it has lead to a bull-market pushing the price of Bitcoin up dramatically in the months following the halving, which takes place roughly every four years.

Twitter handle PlanB @100trillionUSD has created a useful data model to explain these periodic cycles of price fluctuations in relation to the halving events:





This model predicts that following the halving event on May 12, the price of bitcoin will rise into a new phase around $100,000 after the flow of new bitcoins into the market gets factored in and reflected into the price. The different phases of this model also take into consideration how the use case for bitcoin develops over time. In the early days, the most popular bitcoin narrative was “proof of concept”, in the next phase that changed to “payments”, followed by “E-gold” where the price of one bitcoin was close to the price of one ounce of gold. This model has proven its value over the previous halvings on the network, but it is worth noting that some of the scaling issues that appeared during the bull-market of 2017 are yet to be resolved.

Twitter user @C3_Nik states: “The Scalability issues surrounding #Bitcoin $BTC haven't been improved over the last few years. Nothing in terms of the technology has changed since the BTC network slowed down to a crawl and the average fee rose to 60$ in late 2017. It can kill the next bull run for BTC, easily.”

During all-time high bull-market of 2017, the network slowed down significantly, while the transaction fees rose to levels above what most people are comfortable with for smaller transactions, leading to a lot of investments flowing into altcoins where transactions were faster and cheaper.

@C3_Nik goes on to state “And this isn't some 'maybe', it is a proven fact. The data is there. Next time it will happen again. #Bitcoin $BTC will become unusable right in the middle of the next bull run. What will happen then? I hope that the market realises that there are better solutions that work.”

In the years following the launch of bitcoin, several other cryptocurrencies have been launched. One notable example is Ripple's XRP that focuses on international remittances and on-demand liquidity. While some people in the digital assets community think of Ripple as the banker's coin that does not follow the ethos of Bitcoin, Ripple labs went to meet with regulators as soon as possible in order to work with regulators and speed up the process of adoption and implementation. XRP is today the third biggest digital asset by market cap and has partnerships with more than 300 banks around the world. With all the developments in the recent months with the coronavirus pandemic and the economic fall out of that, there is now an added incentive for people to use digital payments instead of using cash due to the risk of getting infected. When the governments around the world are printing money on a large scale leading to inflation and the devaluing of their population's savings and retirements accounts, digital assets can, like gold and silver be used as a safe haven investment for protecting their wealth.

Whether or not the stock to flow model holds true and bitcoin reaches $100,000, the cryptocurrency industry is here to stay, and there are many other solutions than Bitcoin for secure digital payments. During these testing times, the future looks bright for digital assets.

","Bitcoin's upcoming halving has led to a surge in interest from investors in the cryptocurrency, with some enthusiasts making wild predictions about how much it could be worth over the next few years.

The chief executive of one UK-based bitcoin seller expected to see a surge in demand from investors for the rest of this year and believed, rather bullishly, that it could potentially reach $1million within half a decade.

In a little under two weeks the reward for digitally mining Bitcoin will be halved from 12.5 coins per block to 6.25, constricting the supply of the cryptocurrency and therefore, in the view of some, driving up its price.

Bitcoin will become harder to mine from 11 May, constricting the supply of the cryptocurrency

Like most other investment classes, bitcoin collapsed in mid-March to under $5,000 a coin, having previously sat at above $10,000 on Valentine's Day - in the last day, it has rebounded to nearly $9,000 a coin.

It gained around $1,500 a coin between Wednesday and Thursday as we approach the halving, but it has also performed well since the US Federal Reserve announced unlimited quantitative easing on 23 March.

If you do buy into bitcoin Find out how bitcoin and the blockchain works, so that you have some understanding of the system, the ledger, the major players and the public and private key elements. Remember bitcoin yields nothing and its main source of value is scarcity. Most bitcoin activity is trading not investing. Research coin wallets, the digital vaults where cryptocurrency is held, and consider security carefully. Bitcoins have been stolen before, understand how this happened. Be prepared for extreme volatility. The price can move by 20 per cent in one day and you could easily lose half of your cash in a far quicker time that investing in the stock market. Consider how you would cash in any gains. There are reports that this has proved hard for some people. A time of market stress could lead to people being locked in and unable to trade. Read our guide to How to be a successful investor, which looks at the far less high octane world of long-term investing and how to make it a success. What is bitcoin? The digital currency that most will be familiar with is free from government interference and can be shared instantly online. It doesn't rely on trusting one central monetary authority. The underlying technology is blockchain, a financial ledger maintained by a network of computers that can track the movement of any asset without the need for a central regulator.

Glen Goodman, an expert and author of the book The Crypto Trader, said: 'There's a popular narrative going around social media that bitcoin will benefit from all the money printing by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and other central banks.

'The ""money printer goes brrr...."" meme is wildly popular.

'All these newly created dollars, pounds and euros are being used to bail out governments, companies and workers during the global lockdown.

'Historically, creating large amounts of new money tends to lead to inflation and can cause currencies to lose value.

The 'money printer goes brrr' meme has become popular online with the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England announcing billions in quantitative easing. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts believe the fact it is finite makes it a hard currency that retains its value, like gold

'In times like that, people traditionally flock to gold, which they see as a hard currency because it can't be created in infinite amounts.

'Bitcoin is now seen by many people in the same way, because new bitcoins are created slowly and there is maximum limit of 21million bitcoins.

'Its price has been rising recently, as people transfer some of their savings into bitcoin.'

Gold prices have also surged and reached all-time highs in recent months, as investors piled out of stocks and bought into assets known to retain their value in times of trouble.

What about the halving?

Crypto enthusiasts are split on whether the halving, the third in bitcoin's history, will lead to a boom in the price as fewer coins enter digital circulation.

Halvings take place every time 210,000 blocks are mined, occurring roughly every four years.

Mining, put as simply as possible, is the process of adding transaction records to bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions or blockchain, done by specialised computers.

It currently takes around 10 minutes for powerful computers to mine bitcoin and the energy consumed in doing so believed to match that of the entire population of Switzerland.

From 11 May 2020, it will become harder to mine.

Previous events in 2012 and 2016 saw the price reach an all-time high within three to six months, according to Isle of Man-based cryptocurrency exchange Coin Corner.

However, those were both far lower than bitcoin's ultimate high of more than $20,000 reached two years' ago, at the height of bitcoin's boom.

Bitcoin's price fell of a cliff at the start of March but has rebounded, especially as the halving got nearer

Coin Corner chief executive Danny Scott believes bitcoin reaching a $1million price tag within five years wasn't unrealistic.

He said: 'As the third halving event to occur, there are expectations for what might come after, with history telling us that the bitcoin price will typically begin to rise significantly within the 12 months following a halving - something that can be simply put down to supply and demand.

'The current unexpected global crisis and a number of notable events in bitcoin's pipeline over the next nine months is causing speculation throughout the industry that another ""bull run"" is on the horizon and I believe that we can only expect the price of bitcoin to continue in the direction that everything is currently pointing potentially towards that $20,000 figure and beyond.'

He added the exchange, which allows people to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, had seen an increase in customers every month of this year.

Searches for 'Bitcoin halving' hit an all-time high over the last few weeks, beating out searches during previous events in 2012 and 2016

'February was up 5 per cent compared to January and March was up 17.6 per cent compared to February', he said. 'We expect to see this trend continue, not just for the next month, but for the next year.'

It is possible people are piling in ahead of the halving expecting their holdings to increase in value afterwards, with Google Trends data finding the highest number of searches for 'bitcoin halving' in the cryptocurrency's 11-year history in early April.

But some are less convinced the halving will lead to a bitcoin bull run.

Goodman added: 'The halving is a big part of the bullish Bitcoin narrative; it's helping to drive prices higher because it's got a lot of people excited.

'But in a fundamental sense, it doesn't have as big an impact as many people seem to believe.

'The swings in demand for bitcoin are so huge that they swamp any price-effect the halving may have on the supply side.'",These are the largest cyber thefts of the past decade—and 80% of them involve Bitcoin,"Top venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has announced a second crypto fund - worth $515 million.



Announcing the news on Thursday, a16z said the fund would invest in crypto and blockchain startups that are focused on payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), Web 3 and more.



“Payment blockchains could end up doing to banks what email did to the post office and what VoIP [Voice over Internet Protocol] services did to long-distance carriers,” said Chris Dixon and Katie Haun, co-leaders of the fund.



On the potential of DeFi, they said protocols in the space could transform lending, derivatives, insurance, trading and more via blockchains. “We think the next wave of internet business models will come from crypto,” said Dixon and Haun.



A16z’s “Crypto Fund II” comes a few days after reports that said the firm is seeking to raise $450 million for a new crypto fund.



In 2018, A16z raised $350 million for its first crypto fund, and since then, it has invested in notable firms such as Coinbase, Libra, Maker, Compound and more.","Andreessen Horowitz‘s (a16z) second crypto fund shows the venture capital firm is targeting specific areas to invest in the cryptocurrency space.

The company said Thursday it had raised a total of $515 million – more than the original $450 million target – for a second fund called “Crypto Fund II,” dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain projects. It’s also more than the $300 million raised for the VC’s first crypto fund, which launched back in the summer of 2018.

In the blog post announcing the new fund, a16z says it is looking into projects touching next-generation payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), new monetization models and Web3 (the concept of a decentralized internet).

On DeFi, where total value passed the billion-dollar milestone earlier this year, a16z said it saw high potential in the composability of assets. “DeFi opens the components of finance to the same recombination and experimentation that makes open-source software so powerful,” it said.

This marks a contrast to a16z’s first crypto fund. In its initial investment thesis, the VC mentioned a handful of what it saw as interesting use cases, including stablecoins, financial inclusion and the tokenization of real-world assets.

However, it included the caveat that “we are still early in the crypto movement. The infrastructure needs to be improved and the applications are difficult for non-early adopters to use. Many crypto applications still get dismissed as toys.”","The price of bitcoin has suddenly surged by more than $1,500, taking the cryptocurrency to its highest value since February.

Bitcoin returned above $9,000 on Thursday morning, reaching as high as $9,400 before slipping to its current price of $9,200.

The price rise comes less than two weeks ahead a rare event known as a halving, which is expected to have a significant impact on cryptocurrency markets.

It is the first time in nearly four years that the event has taken place, and only the third time in bitcoin’s 11-year history.

The same event in 2016 preceded a 300 per cent rise in bitcoin’s value, while the 2012 halving saw bitcoin’s value shoot up by more than 80-times.

Forecasting the price of bitcoin is notoriously difficult due to its volatility, though some analysts claim that similar gains can be expected for the 2020 event.

“With 12 days to go until the halving there is a frenzy of activity among bullish investors and the price is already racing higher, having shot up more than 20 per cent in the last 36 hours,” Simon Peters, a cryptocurrency analyst at the online trading platform eToro, told The Independent.

“The number of actual participants in the market is also hitting new highs amid the expectation that this halving event will play out like the last one and push the price up sharply. With these tailwinds in place, we think it is likely the price will go above $10,000 before the halving actually takes place.”

The halving comes at a time of global economic uncertainty brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, which Mr Peters claimed will force investors to turn away from traditional assets and towards bitcoin.

“Amid the deteriorating economic outlook for the US economy and the likelihood of an ever increasing monetary supply, which weakens the US dollar and stokes inflation fears, we believe bitcoin could easily test previous highs,” he said.

Recommended Bitcoin price hit by dramatic fluctuations amid coronavirus panic

Others suggest that bitcoin could be hit in a similar way to traditional stocks, as investors seek to liquidate their portfolios.

This appeared to be the case last month, when countries around the world were introducing containment measures to slow down the spread of the Covid-19 virus.

During this time, the price of bitcoin fell to a 12-month low of close to $4,000 following a series of flash crashes sparked by a major cryptocurrency sell-off.","Crypto whales aren’t stopping with Bitcoin. Data indicates large crypto investors are also accumulating Ethereum at a rapid rate.

Adam Cochran, an executive at the privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo, says he manually audited the top 10,000 Ethereum addresses to examine the second-biggest crypto asset’s whale activity, liquidity profitability and market manipulation.

Cochran says existing whales have increased their Ethereum positions by more than $550 million, or 4%, in the past six months, compared to the estimated total of $600 million in new capital influx Bitcoin had across all of last year.

And it’s not just existing whales who are accumulating, according to the DuckDuckGo executive.

“There are a significant number of new wallets in the top 10k who had their first transaction associated with fiat onramp exchanges that serve large scale customers (mostly Gemini, Kraken and Coinbase).

These new addresses often bought $100,000 — $250,000 worth of Ethereum, and they represent around 6% of the top 10,000 addresses (Or ~$100M in new ETH purchases in the past 6 months).”

Combined, new and existing whales have bought more than $650 million in new Ethereum purchases across the past half year, more than the entire Bitcoin inflow total in all of 2019.

And the data indicates those big investors don’t seem interested in selling their ETH holdings, either.

Says Cochran,

“Right now, there is only 19.5M ETH listed on exchanges for sale. Even though 33.6M ETH is deposited in exchanges. That’s only 58% of deposits, so whales are accumulating, not selling.

For comparison, that number has been historically more than 75%+ any time the ETH price has risen by >25%. This is the first time ever, that ETH has risen >50% and the number has been below 80%.”

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Victeah","A recent analysis of the top 10,000 Ethereum (ETH) wallet addresses suggests that the world’s second-largest digital asset (by market cap and overall adoption) could potentially see its value increase significantly in the foreseeable future. This, as the blockchain network prepares to transition from proof-of-work (PoW)-based consensus to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

But the analysis also reveals that there are several questionable practices that are being carried out by a few leading crypto asset exchanges and certain Ether (ETH) “whale” accounts (addresses that hold very large amounts of the digital currency).

Adam Cochran, the report’s author, points out that when Circle Internet Financial acquired Poloniex in February 2018, it had transferred virtual assets into high-security cold storage wallets and maintained strong or adequate reserves.

But when Poloniex was purchased (reportedly for $400 million) by a select group of crypto industry participants, which included Tron founder Justin Sun, it was speculated that a considerable amount of assets were removed from the cold wallets, and they became fractional reserves.

The cold or offline cryptocurrency wallets seem to have only transferred funds to digital currency exchanges that list Tron (TRX), which is a top 20 digital asset by market cap. According to the report, this activity led to a considerable 50% increase in the TRX price and also a significant increase in the number of people buying the digital token.

Although this might be due to Poloniex engaging in cross-market trading on various other crypto asset exchanges, Cochran argues that exchange’s acquisition (in part) by Sun may have been part of a plan to pump the price of TRX.

Cochran goes on to reveal various tactics used by a dozen crypto whale accounts, which appear to manipulate the fragile digital asset market. He claims that this may be done in coordination with virtual currency exchange Bitfinex and may also involve BitMEX, a leading cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform.

The report’s author notes that short positions on ETH seem to increase, beginning on the Bitfinex platform. After this, he says they move to BitMEX and other crypto trading platforms.

He reveals that this is followed by large amounts of Ether moving onto other digital asset exchanges. Usually, Ether is transferred in relatively small batches, presumably in an attempt to prevent or avoid detection by “WhaleAlerts” systems.

Whenever the cryptocurrency market crashes, the whales are able to make quick profits on their short positions, and then acquire ETH again at significantly lower prices. It appears that this same manipulation strategy might also be employed for other major cryptocurrencies.

Cochran claims that Bitfinex’s cold storage wallets manage to get in on these manipulative practices and actions as much as 40% of the time.

Bitfinex might also (allegedly) be using customer funds to cast votes for the transition to programmatic proof-of-work (ProgPoW), a different type of mining algorithm proposed for the Ethereum network.

Prior to casting and tallying the votes, Bitfinex reportedly transferred 1.17 million ETH between offline and hot wallets (those connected to the internet), in order to support ProgPoW.

There was just around 3 million Ether that was involved in voting for the new mining protocol. This suggests that Bitfinex accounted for more than 40% of all votes, the report’s author claims.

Cochran alleges that this indicates that the Ethereum and larger crypto community may not have been supporting the transition to ProgPoW, which has allegedly been promoted by large, influential, and self-interested blockchain industry participants.

Cochran also analyzed the number of large (whale) Ether transfers, and compared them to tweet volume and overall sentiment on Twitter related to Ether. He found that while the majority of whales transferred funds to digital currency exchanges after a “spike” on Twitter (which include anti-Ether narratives), a select few large wallets actually made transfers well before the spikes took place.

Certain whales preempted the anti-Ether sentiment peaks on the microblogging platform 86.7% of the time, Cochran reveals. He added that San Francisco-based Coinbase usually obfuscates (hides and mixes) crypto transactions to and from its trading platform.

The exchange reportedly does this by mixing transfers with several changing cold and hot wallets in a manner that other exchanges might not. This could help maintain financial privacy and prevent manipulative trading (but not always)."
2020-05-01,"Bitcoin is now up over 20% in 2020 after rallying to over $9,500 on Thursday. The cryptocurrency’s recovery from March lows ahead of the protocol’s third halving event is primarily fueled by American investors, according to market data.

On U.S.-based exchanges, bitcoin has traded at sustained premiums during the end of March and through April. Spot premiums indicate that an exchange is experiencing stronger buy-side pressure relative to other spot markets, signaling higher demand.

By contrast, after the cycle lows in December 2018, bitcoin spot prices on all dominant exchanges traded closely to the index price.

Bitcoin futures markets also reflect the strong bullish sentiment of American investors.

When bitcoin plunged to $3,867 on March 12, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, open interest for bitcoin futures markets across the industry plummeted by over 50 percent. Open interest for bitcoin futures on BitMEX, Huobi, and OKEx are still down significantly from their pre-March 12 levels, according to data from Skew.

Neither BitMEX nor Huobi serve U.S. customers. OKEx has only recently allowed U.S.-based traders from a small number of states to use its platform.

Meanwhile, open interest for CME bitcoin futures has more than recovered from its March lows and continues to rally. Although CME open interest is much smaller in relative terms than BitMEX, OKEx or Huobi, these data nonetheless corroborate significantly higher buying interest from U.S.-based investors compared to their non-U.S.-based counterparts. Renaissance Technologies, a market-crushing, U.S.-based asset manager, also recently signalled interest in joining the bitcoin futures market.

Why Americans are scrambling to buy bitcoin is an open question. Bitcoin’s third halving event is less than two weeks away, and Google search data shows record interest in the event. Some buyers might be anticipating significant price inflation after the event.

Bitcoin miners choosing to accumulate long-term spot positions ahead of the halving could also account for the interested buy-side demand. And the number of small bitcoin investors, specifically in the U.S., seems to be quickly growing.

“I also think halving FOMO [“fear of missing out”] and some miner buying activity is a factor, particularly given how good [bitcoin’s] hashrate has looked in the last month,” said Aditya Das, cryptocurrency market analyst at Brave New Coin.

Bitcoin’s recent rally is “healthier” than previous upward trends, said Yan Liberman, former associate at Deutsche Bank and co-founder of Delphi Digital, a digital asset research group, in a correspondence with CoinDesk. Since “Black Thursday,” bitcoin has been “supported by strong growth in spot volumes on exchanges like Coinbase, while futures open interest remained relatively flat at $2 billion following the leverage flush during the March selloff,” said Liberman.

By comparison, bitcoin’s rally at the start of 2020 was “buoyed by speculation,” according to Liberman, based on the doubling of open interest in bitcoin futures markets from $2 billion to over $4 billion within two months.","The price of Bitcoin (BTC) increased from $7,700 to $9,500 in merely 48 hours from Wednesday to Thursday, rising by more than 22%. The market has cooled down since, with the dominant cryptocurrency dropping back below $9,000.

All key data points — such as spot market data, futures volume and institutional demand — suggest that the rally from the $3,000s to the $8,000s was purely organic. It was driven by actual demand from retail investors, and possibly whales, leading up to the Bitcoin block reward halving.

Whether the rapid upsurge from $8,000 to $9,500 was organic or caused by spoof orders in the futures market is unclear. According to Skew, futures volume largely increased when Bitcoin went from $8,000 to $9,500, while it remained relatively low throughout April. Skew said:

“Futures volumes were up significantly the last two days on the rapid break through $8k and $9k, mirroring what occurred on the 12th of March. Nearly $40bln were crossed yesterday.”

Market data indicates that less than two weeks before the halving, the structure of the cryptocurrency market has shifted from being driven by futures exchanges to spot trading platforms. The healthy transition from over-leveraged trades to organic spot trades can build a strong foundation for the next Bitcoin rally.

The Bitcoin rewards halving is set to occur in about ten days, and it will have a significant impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. It will immediately drop the amount of Bitcoin that producers can mine by verifying blocks of transactions, decreasing the rate in which new Bitcoin is introduced to the market. The halving mechanism compliments the trend of Bitcoin as it approaches its fixed supply of 21 million. As only 21 million Bitcoin can ever exist, the halving decreases the pace of its production.

But the narrative around Bitcoin’s halving could be overplayed. In the previous halvings that occurred in 2012 and 2016, Bitcoin’s price did not react significantly until 10 to 11 months after the halvings happened. In the near-term, Bitcoin faces strong resistance levels at $9,200, $10,400 and $11,400 at a high time frame. It has crucial support in the $7,400–$7,600 range, and losing that could send Bitcoin back to the $5,000s.

Top trader explains the current Bitcoin price trend

Speaking to Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency trader Eric Thies explained that the technicals around Bitcoin approaching the halving on May 12 are highly promising. He said:

“In two previous halving's, BTC showed strength by surging to within 40% of the then ATH levels. In each of these prior events, BTC carried on upwards for over a year, and then a year and a half, reaching ATH's along the way. As of right now, BTC looks to be starting the current track as the previous halving events.”

The medium-term trend of Bitcoin is optimistic, but Thies emphasized that retests of lower support levels and pullbacks are unavoidable in the short-term. “These items aside, note that the recent 25% gains will not come without retests and pullbacks to former resistances, in efforts to consolidate the bullish momentum building,” he added.

For Bitcoin to remain in a bullish trend in the aftermath of its halving, it would have to defend the $7,100 support level and avoid a downturn to the mid-$6,000 area. If it can remain above the $7,100 level with strength, Thies believes that $10,600 is a viable target in May. He noted:

“Assuming support holds after an initial retests of our recent gains, AND if bulls hold the current momentum they’ve built, we should see $10.6k by May, and continuation to test the current ATH in the months thereafter.”

Bullish scenario for Bitcoin

The bullish scenario for Bitcoin in the short- to medium-term, as explained by Thies, is quite simple. Technical indicators such as the moving average convergence/divergence, or the MACD, at high time frames — including weekly — signals the start of a new upside movement. A cryptocurrency trader known as RookieXBT said:

“Not a fan of using indicators but had this pointed out to me. MACD on the weekly crossing bullish again. Interesting times going into the halving.”

The relative strength index, or RSI, of Bitcoin is hovering in the 80%–90% range. A reading of more than 75% suggests highly overbought conditions for an asset. But given that the RSI can remain oversold for an extended period of time during a proper recovery, if Bitcoin can avoid a significant pullback to the $4,000–$5,000 range, the probability of a continuation of a bullish trend remains high. Thies also stated:

“While these resistances [$9,200, $10,400 and $11,400] will not be easy to break through, this setup on the macro side of things is impressive and continues to grow with each resistance Bitcoin reclaims. Consolidation will happen and things will need to slow so the market stays somewhat in control. For this, the bulls must maintain approx. $7.1k, which is where several timeframes indicate strong support will be most prominent.”

More traders lean toward a bearish scenario for Bitcoin

Following Bitcoin’s rejection of $9,500 and its reentry to the mid-$8,000 region, more traders are considering the likelihood of Bitcoin seeing a local top rather than a bullish continuation above $10,000. Cryptocurrency trader Michael van de Poppe said that while $4,000 and $5,000 is not likely to be seen again, a healthy retrace to the mid-$6,000 area is reasonable. He said:

“I don't think it's likely to see $4,000–5,000 levels again, especially after the halving. However, a healthy retrace seems reasonable, which is likely due to occur after the halving. Potential targets for these areas are a test of 200-Week MA around $6,500–7,000.”

Mohit Sorout, a founding partner at Bitazu Capital, also described $9,500 as a “logical place for $BTC to take a breather,” suggesting that the intense rally of Bitcoin could lose steam in the short-term.

Another trader known as Big Chonis Trading pointed out that the strong upsurge of Bitcoin since late April led to the formation of a “TD9” on the daily chart of Bitcoin. TD9 is a sell signal in the TD Sequential system that sparks when an asset sees an overextended rally and is due for a correction. “The #bitcoin halving is in 11 days... Plenty of time for one more FOMO pump...? Hard to ignore though how yesterday’s candle closed, today opening on a TD9,” the trader wrote in a Tweet.

Zoran Kole, a cryptocurrency technical analyst, stated that the $7,700–$8,000 range is the next rational area of support for Bitcoin. He noted that in the entire run up to $9,500, bears suffered from an overextended upside movement, and bulls demonstrated euphoria, raising the probability of it being a top. Kole said:

“I personally think the local top is in. Little premature to call it but looks like an SFP of the 9.2 liquidity void. Bears blown the f--- out. Bullievers euphoric. Would want to see 84xx hold for continuation otherwise 7.7-8k is the next area of interest to long.”

Bitcoin rejects at a major trendline. Source: Nunya Bizniz

The negative short-term projections for Bitcoin go in line with the bearish scenario laid out by Thies, who said that a drop below $7,000 would increase the likelihood of a bear trend resumption. Thies told Cointelegraph:

“If needed, $6.8k and $6.4k lie below, but a move to those levels would indicate a continuation of the bear trend that has sent prices as low as $3800 over the last year, after peaking around $15k in July 2019.”

The confluence of Bitcoin rejecting at a key trendline dating back to March 12, a TD9 sell signal, the rally stopping right at the point of Bitcoin breakdown in February, and the tendency of Bitcoin to see “sell-the-news” sell-offs makes a post-halving correction highly likely.

But the noticeable increase in demand for Bitcoin shown by a massive rise in spot volume and institutional interest may serve as a proper basis for a long-lasting rally. As such, despite the 163% price increase since $3,600, a continuation of a bullish trend for Bitcoin cannot be ruled out.","CoinTracking Launches Two Powerful, Free Plug-ins for Crypto Traders

sponsored

Though the top cryptocurrency exchanges offer charts, many don’t offer the analytical features crypto traders need to make good trading decisions. To help fill this need, CoinTracking has partnered with two companies that specialize in cryptocurrency analytics: IntoTheBlock and Cryptosheets. These new integrations provide a whole new use case for the world’s most popular crypto tax software.

What is CoinTracking ?

CoinTracking was founded in 2012 and went online in April 2013 as the world’s first cryptocurrency tax reporting tool and portfolio manager. The company now has over 585,000 active users, which makes it the leader in the space. While crypto traders are CoinTracking’s main demographic, the company’s powerful portfolio management tools have made it popular among crypto tax and investment firms as well.

Now that CoinTracking integrates with IntoTheBlock and CryptoSheets, it has a new use case. In conjunction with the two new plug-ins, CoinTracking can now be used to research altcoins and create entirely new trading strategies. IntoTheBlock’s deep analytical features can be used to make crypto price movement predictions, while CryptoSheets gives traders the ability to create their own custom spreadsheets and charts.

Cryptosheets

Cryptosheets is a spreadsheet plugin for Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets that’s tailor made for cryptocurrency traders. The plugin can be used to pull data from CoinMarketCap, the mining profits calculator WhatToMine, cryptocurrency data provider CoinMetrics.io, Cryptocompare, ParadigmAPI and many other sources including top exchanges like Gemini, Bittrex and others.

The partnership between Cryptosheets and CoinTracking lets CoinTracking subscribers use their portfolio data to create their own customized crypto charts. The integration benefits current Cryptosheets users as well because it expands the number of exchanges that work with the plugin.

How to use it

Anyone who knows their way around a spreadsheet can use Cryptosheets to quickly and easily create their own crypto charts. Those that need help getting started can use one of Cryptosheets’ many templates as a starting point.

While the country is known for its retail market, the exchange is betting on Japan’s strict licensing regime to attract the institutional investors OKCoin specializes in serving.

“Japan is famous for having a lot of money,” said John Feng, CEO of OKCoin Japan, a subsidiary of blockchain services company OK Group. “In Japan, the rate of return is low on any asset for real estate and the stock market because interest rates are so low. Asset management companies and large institutional insurance companies want a little higher return on their assets.”

Feng also hopes to see the strict regulatory regime in Japan draw more international exchanges into the market.

“It’s like the foreign exchange market. You have multinationals that come to Japan and make things more attractive for investors,” Feng said.

Japan is also the second-largest source of crypto-trading traffic after the U.S. and the Japanese yen is the third-strongest currency after the dollar and the euro, Feng added.

Once one of China’s “Big 3” crypto exchanges, OKCoin had to move to San Francisco after its fiat-to-crypto trading was banned in late 2017. The firm’s client base includes customers from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, the U.S., Europe, Russia and Turkey.

“If the large financial institutions see the top exchanges coming to Japan, then they will feel more safe,” Feng said.

Long road

OKCoin Japan’s journey towards a license in Japan began back in 2017.

In the first eight months after the crypto law was passed, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) licensed 16 exchanges. Licensing became more difficult, however, after the cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck lost more crypto in a hack than Mt. Gox did in 2013, which happened 10 days after OKCoin submitted its application. Since then, the FSA and self-regulatory rules promoted by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) have become much more strict.

The Japanese regulator didn’t license any exchanges for a year, and costs began to rise after it resumed its approval process.

Those rising costs were also why crypto exchange Kraken chose to stop operating in Japan back in April 2018.

Licensed exchanges in Japan are considered financial institutions, and their anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) restrictions are just as strict as those imposed on banks in the country.

OKCoin already has a Money Services Business license in the U.S. and is registered with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). It also has a temporary license in Malta and is pursuing a license in Singapore. Getting a license in one of the most strict regulatory regimes in the world means money transfers will be significantly easier to do under the new FATF travel rule, Feng said.

First outsider

The exchange claims to be the first non-Japanese exchange to have obtained the license by going through the regulatory rigors of FSA instead of purchasing an already-licensed Japanese exchange. Other international firms have bought licensed exchanges in Japan to break into the market, Feng added.

For OKCoin, the licensing process involved building a team of nearly 40 employees and developing a proprietary automated transaction monitoring system. (Before going live with spot trading in July, OKCoin expects to add 10 more staff, and other exchanges have hired third-party developers to create a monitoring system.)

The FSA’s next move will include amendments to the Japan Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and Japan Payment Services Act effective May 1, which will create tougher restrictions for exchanges wanting to enable crypto derivatives trading. These amendments caused crypto exchange BitMEX to pull parts of it business out of the country. However, OKCoin plans to work another six months to receive that license. After all, around 80% of trading in Japan is derivatives trading, Feng said.

While the company doesn’t need the same capital requirements as a regulated bank, OKCoin is looking to build more capital to keep a healthy balance sheet as it grows into the new market and partners with other financial institutions, Feng added.

As more licensed exchanges enter the market as financial institutions, banks in Japan may take a more relaxed approach to the space, said Ken Yagami, Japan lead for blockchain sleuthing firm Elliptic.

Currently, there are only around four or five banks in Japan willing to serve crypto firms, Yagami said. (One of Elliptic’s goals is to make banks more comfortable banking crypto firms.)

Japanese banks also have to come out of their own crisis of negative interest rates and the pandemic-induced recession before they’re able to think about expanding into new unknown business lines such as crypto, Yagami added.

While the road to obtaining a license to trade crypto derivatives will include even tougher restrictions, getting that license will give OKCoin a chance to flex its crypto derivatives services.","SEC Commissioner Sees Increasing Demand for Cryptocurrency

Crypto-friendly commissioner with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Hester Peirce, said there is an increase in demand for cryptocurrency as investors seek to diversify their portfolios. The commissioner has been an avid proponent of the SEC approving bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Growing Interest for Cryptocurrency

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, also known in the crypto community as “Crypto Mom,” talked about cryptocurrency and digital dollars during a livestream discussion with Crypto Finance Conference St. Moritz on Tuesday. Noting that the covid-19 pandemic has affected all industries, including cryptocurrency, she said:

We’re seeing more interest coming from institutional quarters than we have in the past. I think that will continue … as people are looking to diversify their portfolios, I think people are also likely to look more to the crypto space.‏‏‎

She elaborated, “As people are more comfortable working in a virtual world in every industry now, I think people are likely to turn more interest to the crypto space.” Peirce previously said even before the coronavirus pandemic that one major advantage of the cryptocurrency industry was that it brings together people from across the world and helps them work together virtually. Industry participants don’t have to be in the same place to be working together.

Peirce was sworn in as an SEC commissioner on Jan. 11, 2018; her term is due to expire on June 5. She has consistently supported the idea of the SEC approving bitcoin exchange-traded funds but so far the SEC has not approved any. In May last year, she said the time was already right for the commission to approve a bitcoin ETF. In February, she announced her Token Safe Harbor Proposal to fill the gap between regulation and decentralization.

Commissioner Peirce on Digital Dollars

Peirce also talked about digital dollars during the livestream. She said that the subject has drawn more interest to cryptocurrencies and more people are now asking questions about crypto. Noting that “It’s helpful for people to think about the positives and negatives of having it be a government-issued versus a private-issued currency,” she opined:

I will say that I think that the idea of a government cryptocurrency, a digital dollar or something like that, is very different than some of the things that we’re talking about with crypto and blockchain and the private sector, but it’s helpful to get people thinking about these things.

However, the commissioner cautioned: “You need to think about privacy issues if you’re creating some sort of digital currency. I think that’s a really important question for a society to ask because people don’t really feel comfortable with the government or anybody else monitoring their transactions.”

The Federal Reserve has been studying the prospect of issuing a digital dollar, particularly to compete with Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency and China’s central bank digital currency. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said that the Fed has no interest in issuing a digital dollar right now. In March, the term “digital dollar” was included in proposed stimulus bills.

Cryptocurrency companies are banned on Google but the platform is allowing phishing sites to impersonate them. London-based bitcoin exchange Coin Corner showed that a fraudulent site mimicking it is allowed on Google’s advertising platform though its own evidence-backed appeals of legitimacy to Google Ads have been constantly ignored.

Coin Corner marketing manager Molly Spiers says the policy is exposing customers to fraud. “So @GoogleAds won’t allow @CoinCorner – a long-standing, legitimate business – on their platform, but will allow phishing companies? Pay attention @Google!” she tweeted on April 30.

Spiers shared a screenshot showing a Google advert that promotes www.coincornerr.com, an apparent phishing site that impersonates the Coin Corner website. The acceptance of the scam site by Google Ads enables it to come up higher on Google Search. She points out:

With Google’s stance on #Bitcoin and #cryptocurrency advertising, any adverts that contain crypto-related keywords are going to be automatically disapproved, so it looks like they have copied our text but removed all references to bitcoin in order to get around Google’s algorithms.

In 2018, Google banned cryptocurrency ads supposedly to protect users from scams but partially lifted the ban to allow regulated exchanges in the U.S and Japan to advertise. The continuing embargo on crypto companies outside the exempted territories, however, is not serving its purpose as phishing sites are allowed while appeals from regulated companies are disregarded.

Coin Corner has been in business for six years and is registered with the British authority, the exchange’s CEO, Danny Scott, commented in Spiers’ thread. The company has contacted Google a number of times to ask for exemption in the UK to no avail.

Scott said Coin Corner reported the scam site to Google but it has not been removed from search results. Google has previously continued to run adverts from phishing sites even after they are exposed.

In a related episode of policy inconsistency, Google’s sister platform, Youtube, recently took down Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s videos, claiming that they are impersonations. You Tube is currently facing a Ripple lawsuit for not doing enough to protect users from giveaway scams.

The Alphabet-owned platforms need to update their policies and technologies to stop promoting fraudulent initiatives while censoring legitimate businesses and exposing consumers to scams.

Bitcoin saw an impressive 17.5% price increase over the past 7-days of trading as the cryptocurrency managed to climb above the $7,500 resistance to break above $8,000. It continued to push higher and eventually reached a weekly high of $9,430 before dropping to the current resistance at $8,870 (1.272 Fib Extension).

This price increase is not surprising because the Bitcoin block halving event is just a short 10-days away.

If the buyers continue to push above the current $8,870 level, resistance is expected at $9,000, $9,150, and $9,430 (1.414 Fib Extension). Above this, added resistance lies at $9,500, $9,815, $10,000, and $10,226 (1.618 Fib Extension).

Toward the downside, support lies at $8,620 (.236 Fib Retracement), $8,500, and $8,000. Beneath this, additional support is found at $7,800 (200-days EMA), $7,600 (100-days EMA), and $7,400.

Ethereum

Ethereum saw a 13% price surge over the past 7-days of trading as the cryptocurrency increased from the $187 support to break above $200 and reach as high as $225 during the week.

The cryptocurrency has since dropped from this high as it trades at $211, which is resistance provided by the bearish .618 Fibonacci Retracement level.

Looking ahead, resistance above $211 is located at $220 (1.272 Fib Extension), $225, and $230 (1.414 Fib Extension). If the buyers continue to drive higher from here, added resistance is found at $245 (bearish .786 Fib Retracement), $250, and $270.

Toward the downside, support can be found at $200 (.236 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, support lies at $189 (.382 Fib Retracement), $180, and $175 (.5 Fib Retracement & 100-days EMA).

Against Bitcoin, Ethereum was trading within a range between 0.026 BTC and 0.0247 BTC for the majority of the week. However, in yesterday’s trading session, ETH dropped beneath this lower boundary as it crashed into the 0.0239 BTC level.

Moving forward, if the sellers push lower, support is located at 0.0236 BTC and 0.023 BTC (.5 Fib Retracement & 100-days EMA). Beneath this, support lies at 0.0225 BTC (200-days EMA), 0.0223 BTC (.618 Fib Retracement), and 0.022 BTC.

On the other side, if the bulls push back above 0.024 BTC, resistance lies at 0.0247 BTC, 0.025 BTC, and 0.026 BTC. This is followed by resistance at 0.0263 BTC and 0.0266 BTC (bearish .886 Fib Retracement).

Ripple

XRP saw a 12.5% price hike this week as the cryptocurrency finally manages to break above the strong resistance at $0.20. It had been trapped at this level since the mid-March market collapse and was turned away on each attempt to break above.

After breaking this resistance, XRP surged higher to reach the $0.25 level. However, it was unable to sustain this high and closed the day beneath the 200-days EMA at $0.226. XRP has pushed lower from here as it currently trades at $0.217.

If the buyers manage to push above $0.226 (200-days EMA) again, higher resistance lies at $0.234, $0.245, and $0.255 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement). Above this, added resistance is located at $0.26 and $0.271.

On the other side, if the sellers push lower, support is found at $0.21, $0.206 (100-days EMA), and $0.20. Beneath this, added support is located at $0.192 (.382 Fib Retracement) and $0.18.

XRP had an exciting week against BTC. During the week, it managed to surge as high as 2800 SAT as it climbed above the long term falling trend line. However, it quickly reversed this increase over the past couple of days as the cryptocurrency plummetted back beneath the trend line to create a fresh April low at around 2400 SAT.

The coin has now risen to the 2470 SAT level today, but the outlook still looks pretty bearish.

If the sellers push lower, the first level of support lies at 2455 SAT. This is followed by support at 2400 SAT, 2360 SAT, 2350 SAT, and 2300 SAT.

If the buyers drive upward, resistance lies at 2470 SAT, 2500 SAT, 2560 SAT, and 2600 SAT. Above this, added resistance lies at 2650 SAT and 2710 SAT.

Stellar

Stellar saw a fantastic 12.8% price surge this week as the cryptocurrency managed to rise from the $0.06 level to reach as high as $0.08. The coin since dropped lower into the $0.07 level after finding support at $0.066.

This price surge has now caused XLM to regain all of the losses that were seen during the March 2020 collapse after being able to surge by a total of around 77% over the past 30-days of trading.

Looking ahead, if the buyers push above $0.07, resistance is located at $0.0757 (bearish .786 Fib Retracement), and $0.08. Above this, higher resistance lies at $0.082 (1.618 Fib Extension), $0.085, and $0.09.

Toward the downside, the first level of support lies at $0.066 (.236 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, support lies at $0.06 (200-days EMA), $0.058, and $0.055 (100-days EMA).

Against BTC, XLM managed to clock in a fresh 2020 high at the 927 SAT level this week. Unfortunately, it was unable to close above the 900 SAT level, which caused it to fall. It managed to find support at 727 (.5 Fib Retracement), and it rebounded higher to the current 805 SAT level.

If the bulls continue to drive higher, resistance lies at 820 SAT, 850 SAT, and 900 SAT (bearish .236 Fib Retracement). Above this, resistance lies at 954 SAT (1.272 Fib Extension), 985 SAT (1.414 Fib Extension), and 1000 SAT.

Toward the downside, support lies at 775 SAT (.382 Fib Retracement & 200-days EMA). Beneath this, added support is located at 740 SAT (.5 Fib Retracement), 700 SAT (.618 Fib Retracement), and 680 SAT.

ChainLink

LINK saw a small 0.5% price decline over this past week of trading as the cryptocurrency moves sideways at the $3.80 level. It did manage to spike higher during the week but was unable to overcome the resistance at $4.22 (bearish .786 Fib Retracement level).

Moving forward, if the buyers push higher, the first level of resistance lies at $4.05. Above this, resistance is located at $4.22 (bearish .786 Fib Retracement), $4.34, $4.54, and $4.63.

On the other side, support is located at $3.46 (.382 Fib Retracement), $3.22 (.5 Fib Retracement), and $3.00 (.618 Fib Retracement).

Against BTC, LINK has been suffering throughout the entire week after rolling over from the 0.00051 BTC resistance (bearish .786 Fib Retracement). It continued to drop throughout the week until finding support at 0.000428 BTC (.5 Fib Retracement), where it currently trades.

Looking ahead, if the bulls can rebound from here, resistance is located at 0.00044 BTC, 0.000451 BTC, and 0.00048 BTC. Above this, additional resistance lies at 0.0005 BTC, 0.000516 BTC, and 0.00053 BTC.

Beneath 0.000438 BTC, support can be expected at 0.0004 BTC (.618 Fib Retracement & 200-days EMA), 0.00038 BTC, and 0.00037 BTC (.786 Fib Retracement).","Crypto payments platform Swipe has partnered with Samsung to add its digital currency Visa debit card on Samsung Pay.

Announced on Friday, this will allow Swipe Android users to directly add their Swipe debit cards to Samsung’s mobile payment platform for making day-to-day transactions.

With this integration, Swipe debit users can directly convert their cryptocurrencies into euros while making transactions with Samsung Pay.

“We are excited to bring Samsung Pay for our cardholders,” Joselito Lizarondo, Swipe CEO, said. “This integration and relationship with Samsung will open cryptocurrency adoption and make transacting with our Visa card in Euros converted by crypto seamless.”

Headquartered in the Philippines, the company has operations in the United Kingdom and Estonia.

Swipe also received approval for operations in the United States under Visa’s TPA program and also has plans to offer services in the South Asia and Asia-Pacific region by the end of this year.

Finding opportunities in a crisis

The company is also optimistic about the surge in digital transactions globally amid the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic.

“Given all of the COVID-19 issues and people steering away from physical products like cash and, in some instances, cards, a digital solution really helps put our client’s needs first,” Lizarondo added.

2020-05-02,"A prediction that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to begin a fourth parabolic phase that will bring the leading cryptocurrency to more than a quarter-million dollars is lighting up the cryptoverse.

A post revealing the new forecast from price analyst PlanB shot across crypto Twitter this week, with more than 4,200 likes at the time of publishing.

But the forecast itself has reignited the great debate on the relationship between Bitcoin’s halving – which will slash the rate of new BTC entering the market in a matter of days – and the price of BTC.

According to PlanB, who recently told Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano that he’s a member of an institutional investment team that manages roughly $100 billion in assets, his latest stock-to-flow model shows BTC rising to $288,000 by the end of 2024.

The forecast analyzes Bitcoin’s scarcity by removing time and grouping Bitcoin’s growth in phases representing its transition from a proof-of-concept to a potential payment method, to a store of value, and then a financial asset.

PlanB says the relationship between Bitcoin’s price and its scarcity, determined by dividing the overall supply by its yearly production, are cointegrated. The term implies the relationship is especially solid, as if the ratio and price are tethered to one another.

Macro investor Raoul Pal says the new model, which PlanB designed to also evaluate gold and silver, offers a powerful method of analysis.

“This is what I saw in [PlanB’s] model when he first revealed it. It gives a great valuation for not only bitcoin but gold and silver too (and other similar assets). It’s super powerful for relative valuations and outright valuations for all these assets. Amazing work.”

However, the forecast is also earning plenty of detractors, including economist Alex Krüger. He says the fact that Bitcoin’s scarcity is locked in and not random fundamentally destroys the predictive power of the model.

“Bitcoin’s Stock to Flow and Price are NOT cointegrated. Therefore the Stock to Flow model has no predictive power. Stock to Flow cannot be used to predict price. Stock to Flow and Price are not cointegrated because Stock to Flow is not a unit root process, i.e. not random…

[Bitcoin’s Supply] is determined by an algo. Not randomly. Controlled Supply is the whole point about Bitcoin…

Please note this is not subject to interpretation. This is not about ‘all models are wrong, but some are useful.’ The S2F analysis is interesting. But the S2F model is useless for predicting price, as the underlying assumptions of the model are not met. Now and always.”

Another longtime criticism of Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow chart is that it’s based on a small number of data points, with Bitcoin going through just two prior halvings in its short history.

Since those halvings, Bitcoin has also become increasingly institutionalized, leading Coinshares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors to argue that the rise of futures from the likes of CME has fundamentally made Bitcoin’s future price far less predictable.

Key Takeaways FTX is adding new features at an unprecedented pace.

The exchange was quick to launch OIL Futures after the Oil crash.

Quant Zone is bringing algorithmic trading to the masses.

Share this article

FTX, a Hong Kong-based crypto derivatives exchange, has introduced several new features after its best month yet in terms of the trading volume.

In April, FTX launched FTX Pro App, Volatility Tokens, Oil Futures, and several new additions to its spot market. The exchange also launched the FTX Quant Zone, a tool that enables traders to build and share trading strategies.

New Products Coming to FTX

The rise of the FTX exchange has been making headlines all throughout 2020, with the company continuing to scale both its features list and its volume with each passing month.

While April has been a significant month for the exchange according to its Monthly Digest report, there’s room for further growth in May.

Aside from a new and improved native FTX Pro mobile app, which is set to be released both on iOS and Android, the exchange also released several new products.

Half Tokens (HALF) are versions of FTX’s tokens that use 50% leverage, with ETHHALF being 50% ETH and 50% USD. The tokens rebalance at the end of each day to return their target leverage.

BVOL/iBVOL Tokens represent a broad set of long or short positions on the FTX MOVE contracts, which represent close to perfect volatility in Bitcoin’s price.

FTX Features to Harness Huge Volumes

Last month, FTX added Oil Futures to their ever-growing list of products, with OIL tokens behaving like futures that expire to the spot price of WTI oil +$100.

Multiple other spot markets have also been added over the last month. This includes USDT pairs for over 75% of spot markets, as well as Chainlink and Tron spot, perpetual futures, and quarterly futures markets.

Custom logins enable users to configure special account permissions that allow others to access their accounts, while an improved toggle feature makes switching between sub-accounts faster and easier.

However, one of the most important additions to the company is the Quant Zone, a tool that allows users to build and share their own trading strategies.

FTX described it as “algorithmic trading brought down to the level of Lego building blocks” and said it was one of the most underrated aspects of FTX.

Quant Zone allows anyone to build crypto trading strategies without programming knowledge.

In the following weeks, users will be able to allow subscribers access to the trading algorithms they’ve built in FTX’s Quant Zone and get paid in FTT, the exchange’s native token.

Professional traders will also be able to make trades for their “subscribers” and earn commissions in FTT. It is not dissimilar from eToro’s social trader tool.

In its report, the company said that its spot volume has increased by over 10x in April.

While many have criticized the exchange for the unpredictability and volatility of their trading products, it’s the pace of development and innovation that has pushed FTX’s volume through the roof","In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, crypto pioneer and BitInstant co-founder, Charlie Shrem, offered his perspective on the early days of crypto.

Despite missing some of the comradery from Bitcoin’s (BTC) infancy, Shrem stated that Bitcoin’s early adopters could have better recognized that crypto was much bigger than a new technology to “have fun and experiment with.”

Charlie Shrem on the early days of crypto

When asked what lessons the contemporary digital asset landscape can learn from the early days of crypto, Shrem stated: “I think the early days could have actually had better lessons.”

“I feel like in the early days, we could have learned a lot from the leaders of today,” said Shrem. “We could have learned how to run our companies better and how to treat our staff better.

“We could have learned better how to not be children and realize that this Bitcoin thing is bigger than us, not, you know, just for us to have fun and experiment and play around with. So maybe in those early years, like 2013, 2014, 2015, we could have been all a little bit more adult.”

However, Shrem notes that the mistakes of yesterday were critical to underpinning the successes of today and tomorrow, stating: “But at the same time, the fact that we were kind of crazy and stupid is the reason that we're all here today with Bitcoin, you know.”

“So it's kind of like I don't really like to look back at lessons learned because if we didn't make those mistakes, how do I know that I would be here talking to you today?” he added.

Coinbase’s launch signposted end of BitInstant

On the subject of BitInstant, the pioneering crypto exchange co-founded by Shrem in 2011, Charlie stated that he is “really happy with the legacy of BitInstant.”

“BitInstant ended up shutting down for a good reason, [...] we just couldn’t keep up with [the] regulations,” he stated. “I joke that we're one of the only crypto companies that actually didn't take money from our users and returned all our everyone's money and we shut down.”

After comprising the sole platform facilitating near-instant Bitcoin purchases in the United States for two years, Shrem stated that the launch of Coinbase signalled the oncoming end of BitInstant:

“We knew when Coinbase launched that our time was up because Coinbase was backed by a lot of money, by Silicon Valley — and Silicon Valley didn’t like me because I had been them ‘F you’ for so long.”

“I knew our time was over,” Shrem stated, adding: “I was fine with that, our legacy is like Netscape.”","Days after Facebook-backed Libra scaled down its ambitions to become a global currency, China is now inching ahead in the race. (Image: Reuters)

China’s central bank has started testing its official Bitcoin-like digital currency DCEP, and the bank is now planning to roll out the virtual money payment system soon. Days after Facebook-backed Libra scaled down its ambitions to become a global currency, China is now inching ahead in the race. Digital Currency Research Institute of the People’s Bank of China (PBC) said that the research and development work of China’s official digital currency DCEP is proceeding steadily, PTI reported. China is currently carrying out internal pilot tests for the cryptocurrency in four cities. However, the cryptocurrency has not been officially launched yet, state media reported.

Trial runs for DCEP will be piloted in a small range of banks and end users. After that, it will be spread to a wider range with certain improvement in technology and system, the Global Times reported. Later, more banks are also likely to participate in the test of the DCEP to improve overall technology, security and stability of the payment tool, Chen Bo, director of the Finance Research Centre at the Institute of Finance and Economics at the Central University of Finance and Economics told the daily.

“There will be two types of players in future trials, the banks and telecom companies. At present, the central bank is testing the software of DCEP, and whether it will be combined with 5G and sim cards in the future needs to be discussed,” Chen said.

Earlier, US-based social media website Facebook had also announced its plans to launch its in-house cryptocurrency called Libra with launch expected in 2020. However, the currency met with a lukewarm response in the home market with US regulators and politicians expressing concerns about the currency. India too had expressed reservations about cryptocurrencies in general.","Bitcoin Sextortion: Scams Using Email, Videos, Passwords to Extort BTC

Millions of people worldwide have received sextortion scam emails in 2020 asking for bitcoin. These bitcoin sextortion schemes sometimes include recipients’ passwords to make the threat more real. The authorities have advised what to do if you receive a bitcoin sextortion email.



Bitcoin Sextortion Scams Proliferate Globally

The number of people targeted by bitcoin sextortion scams in 2020 has increased rapidly. According to an analysis by British security company Sophos, millions of people recently received sextortion scam emails in the week it analyzed.

“In fact, the number was probably more like tens or even hundreds of millions,” Sophos senior threat analyst Paul Ducklin wrote, adding that some people received between two and five different varieties of this scam. He explained, “The scams exploited global botnets on compromised PCs to dispatch millions of spam emails to recipients around the world,” elaborating:

Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, the Republic of Korea, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Colombia, and Peru are the top 10 countries where these compromised computers were used to dispatch the spam messages.

The cybersecurity firm found that 81% of the millions of sextortion scam messages it analyzed were in English, 10% in Italian, 4% in German, 3.5% in French, and 1.2% in Chinese.

What Is Sextortion and Examples of Sextortion Emails 2020

Sextortion is a widely used form of online blackmail where a cyber scammer threatens to reveal intimate images or videos of someone online — often to their friends, family, work colleagues, or social media lists — unless they pay a ransom quickly. The scammer often asks for payment in cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin.

A sextortion mail scammer may claim to have compromised your computer, or other electronic devices, threatening that your webcams have been recording you watching sexual content. “I know pretty much everything about you. Your entire Facebook contact list, phone contacts along with all the online activity on your computer,” the scammer may write. Another sextortion mail may say: “the last time you went to see porn material on webpages, my spyware was activated inside your personal computer which ended up logging a lovely video footage of your masturbation simply by activating your cam.”

Sophos also provided some examples, such as “We made a video of you on a porn site with the screenshots and the webcam footage side-by-side” and “We also used this malware to film you via your webcam and to take screenshots of your browser.” Sophoslabs security researcher Tamás Kocsír pointed out:

If you are worried about becoming the target of a sextortion scam, disable or cover the camera on your computer.

To make the threat more real, some sextortion mail may include your full or partial passwords as proof that there is actually malware on your computers. One of Sophos’ sextortion email examples reads:

Attention. We implanted malware on your computer, which means we have been keeping tabs on you, including grabbing your passwords and getting access to your accounts.

However, Ducklin advised that these passwords are often old ones you used before in the past. “In truth, the passwords sent out in these scams have typically been dredged up from old data breaches,” he opined. “Although the password you see may have been your password once, the crooks didn’t get it from your computer recently.”

Other than email, sextortion can occur on a number of social network platforms, such as Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram, Skype, Kakaotalk, Line, and Wechat. In particular, Whatsapp sextortion schemes have been gaining popularity recently. On these platforms, someone can befriend you and ask for selfies or sexy videos of you which can then be used to blackmail you with.

Sextortion Scam Emails Asking for Bitcoin

A sextortion email often ends with a call for action to hurry the recipient to make immediate payment to prevent their explicit photos or videos from being shown to their friends, family, or other contacts. Ducklin detailed that the email could emphasize, “We know who they are, because we have your passwords,” adding:

The extortion demand is typically somewhere from $700 to $4000, payable to a bitcoin address provided in the email.

Bitcoin sextortion scams have proven to be lucrative for scammers, according to research by Sophos, since it takes little effort and investment to send scam emails that can result in a lot of money for them. The company recently traced the origins of millions of sextortion scam emails launched between September 2019 and February 2020 and analyzed what happened to the money deposited by victims into attackers’ bitcoin wallets.

Kocsír shared: “While most recipients either didn’t open the email or didn’t pay, enough of them did to net the attackers around 50.9 bitcoin, equivalent to nearly $500,000.”

The researcher additionally explained that some sextortion scammers use rather sophisticated techniques, such as “innovative obfuscation techniques designed to bypass anti-spam filters.” He further described that some “Examples of this include breaking up the words with invisible random strings, inserting blocks of white garbage text, or adding words in the Cyrillic alphabet to confuse machine scanning.”

Sextortion Is Illegal — What to Do if You Receive a Sextortion Email?

Receiving a bitcoin sextortion email can be alarming and intimidating. Many people are genuinely worried that the scammers may actually have their passwords or explicit photos and videos. However, anyone receiving a sextortion scam mail should know that scammers typically have no compromising information about them.

“It’s all a bluff,” Ducklin believes, asserting that the people behind sextortion email scams “don’t have malware on your computer, don’t have a video of you doing anything, don’t have screenshots of your browsing habits, and haven’t just stolen a list of your friends and family to send their non-existent video to.”

The U.K. National Crime Agency has advised how to deal with bitcoin sextortion scams. The organization recommends you report the scam to the police, do not pay any money, stop communicating with the person immediately, report the scam to your internet service provider, and take screenshots with as much information as possible for evidence. Californian District Attorney Jeff Reisig also advised what to do if you get a sextortion mail. He emphasized:

You should remember that sextortion is illegal. If you’re targeted in this kind of scam, you get in touch with your local police. It’s also recommended that you save all of the original e-mails from the hacker.

The growth is said to be fuelled by corporate users in banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector and government offices are increasingly adopting digital tokens.

Speaking to Inc42, Sathvik Vishwanath, cofounder and CEO of Unocoin, said that since the trading restrictions have been lifted, Indian companies have started allowing instant deposit platform, where people can now buy Bitcoins, without any hassles. India contributes to 17% of the world’s population, but if you have seen the volume of trades happening in the cryptocurrency in India, it is not even close to 1% of the world, added Vishwanath.

In other words, the growth has been very slow as there had been no activities, plus the regulations were only lifted in March 2020, and now due to Covid-19 it is taking some more time. “To be in line with the rest of the world, India will take at least one or two years,” he added.

In another report, the global Crypto ATM market was projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.60% to reach $183.779 Mn by 2024, from $18.513 Mn in 2018. However, given the unprecedented time caused because of Covid-19, the market is expected to plummet in the coming years.

Talking about Unocoin Crypto ATM, Vishwanath said that it is not going to happen in India anytime soon, as the maintenance of the kiosk puts an overhead cost and is expensive. “It is absolutely unviable today. I would recommend users to use cryptocurrency exchange platforms instead,” said Vishwanath.
