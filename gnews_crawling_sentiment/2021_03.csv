2021-01-03,"Crypto just won. You probably missed that in the last few months with the news jammed with Covid, vaccine debates, Brexit and Trump’s shenannigans. Crypto devotees have been bewildered why so little attention was given by the mainstream media to Bitcoin’s rise in 2020 and the vast retinue of crypto entities that followed it. The faithful could see what was happening, how significant it was and were confused as to why so few had noticed or cared.

Commenting on the low price of Ethereum in November, as it lagged behind Bitcoin’s rapid rise, one crypto commentator, knowing its price would soon rocket observed: “It’s free money. It’s just free money.” He was right.

Bitcoin, the first and most powerful cryptocurrency celebrates its twelfth birthday today. The first block was mined on January 3 2009 and reached an all-time high of around $29,000 dollars in December. Its previous all-time high was in December 2017 when there was manic purchasing and the bubble burst. How the bloaty city financiers sneeringly talked of tulips to show how learned they were, how those like Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman, who had never managed to get more than ten feet away from a university in his entire life, asserted that Bitcoin would disappear like a puff of smoke.

This high is different. For one thing, the market cap is much larger (more Bitcoin in existence), some half a trillion dollars, and secondly Bitcoin’s zealots are different too. Back in 2017, many of the purchasers were anarchists, libertarians, bong-masters, daredevil speculators, the Chinese and other nationalities hoping to dodge dodgy governments.

Now, it’s the Suits. The three comma crew. Big money has come calling. The tulips, well suddenly, the tulips, they smell wonderful. Paypal has offered its users, in the US, crypto. The S&P and Dow Jones indices will be starting a crypto index for some 550 of the top traded coins.

In December one of the oldest insurance companies in the US, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance, stuck a $100 million into Bitcoin. Let me repeat that: an insurance company, by definition, the most arthritic, boring, unimaginative bastards in the room bought Bitcoin.

And with bonus irony, even dodgy governments (Venezuela, Iran) are getting into Bitcoin.

In 1776 Adam Smith blamed “the avarice and injustice” of governments for debasing the value of money and causing the suffering of their citizens. In 1976, Friedrich Hayek wrote a paper calling for the “denationalisation of money”, not really meaning that, but rather the “de-governmenting” of money, removing governmental interference from money, although he had no idea how to achieve it.

It’s happened. As governments all around the world make money, printers go “brrrr” – Bitcoin has become the Austrian goldbug’s dream: hard, hard money. Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy has invested a billion dollars into Bitcoin and has become the St Paul of Crypto, taking the gospel to all corners of business, lecturing Elon Musk and others that they should get in. He asserts his company will hold Bitcoin for a hundred years.

Bitcoin is at the start of a bull run that could see it reach a hundred thousand dollars by the end of 2021. But even if it doesn’t, even if it only goes up a measly thirty per cent, the world has changed.

In terms of blockchain tech, Bitcoin is now Stephenson’s Rocket. It has completely failed as a High Street buy-your-coffee cash. But it has triumphed spectacularly as a store of value, as a digital gold.

But what follows in its wake, is probably more important. Decentralised finance (Defi) is the next wave. In 2020 it went from a value of $1 billion to $16 billion. How’s your bank treating you? Getting a solid 0.1 per cent for locking down your money? Interest in the world of crypto starts around four per cent and goes much, much higher.

It’s true that the same safeguards aren’t there in crypto, but the big American exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken are almost as safe as banks, and Kraken has actually obtained a bank charter in the crypto-friendly state of Wyoming. Not to mention that the ever-reliable Swiss shrewdly hopped on the blockchain bandwagon years ago.

It’s the classic Fichtean thesis-antithesis-synthesis. The crypto companies are becoming the banks the crypto diehards hated so much and the banks are opening up to crypto. And Defi will flourish, because money is made there. There will be catastrophes, swindles and failures, but I believe the future is there.

And it’s not just dosh. Blockchain does culture too. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are the frontline for a lot of artistic endeavours now. The American artist, Beeple (a sort of science fiction Banksy with great lighting effects) has been selling his digital work for huge sums.

If you’re lucky enough to have some spare cash in 2021, it seems the only way to make some respectable gains is either gambling, the stockmarket or crypto.

The March market crash will go down in history as one of the steepest and most rapid sell-offs to ever sweep cryptocurrency markets. Over the course of an hour, bitcoin‘s price plummeted thousands of dollars and order book liquidity all but evaporated. This chart shows the sum of all bids and asks placed on Coinbase’s BTC-USD order book before, during and after the first price crash. We can observe that when the crash began around 10:30am, the quantity of orders surrounding the midprice plummeted, forcing a liquidity crisis that perpetuated the steep fall in price.

This chart is one of my favorites because it demonstrates the important role that market makers play in creating and maintaining liquidity in cryptocurrency markets. Ultimately, the March crash proved that the price of an asset is often less a reflection of the “true value at a point in time assigned through the process of market-based price discovery” and more a product of relentless feedback loops triggered by automatic liquidations and decimated order book depth. As cryptocurrency markets mature and order book liquidity improves, we can expect the magnitude and frequency of such price crashes to decrease.

IntoTheBlock categorizes on-chain transfers of over $100,000 as “large transactions.” The aggregate volume in large transactions serves as a proxy to institutional investors’ and high net worth individuals’ transaction activity.

Large transaction volume for Bitcoin has grown considerably in 2020 along with institutional interest. Comparing the average large transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain for December 2020 relative to December 2019, we observe it has more than quadrupled from an average of $7 billion per day to over $30 billion.

In 2020, institutions finally embraced bitcoin but not always in the way one would expect. For instance, sophisticated investors such as hedge funds have been looking at capturing spreads by looking at the inefficiencies of this nascent market. This has translated in particular to leveraged funds positioning of CME bitcoin futures making new record shorts almost on a weekly basis in the last quarter of 2020.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector saw moderate adoption during the first half of the year, with lending protocols dominating the space. At the time, the total value locked in DeFi was relatively stable, for the most part ranging between $700 million and $1 billion. Then, on June 16, Compound launched its governance token. The interest in the sector then exploded (quite literally), as yield farming attracted many new participants into the space.

The total value locked in DeFi has increased from $670 million to $14.5B in 2020, a growth of 2100%.

By December, 1 million unique addresses were affiliated with DeFi, a 10x growth from January. Both lending platforms and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have seen particularly strong growth this year, while derivatives platforms have seen a more moderate (albeit strong) growth.

2021 prediction: DeFi derivatives platforms will see a more substantial growth, with stricter regulations on the centralized derivatives market leading traders to alternative markets.

Instead of trying to recap the annual or even the weekly performance in macro markets (because many will have done that in much more depth and with more perspective than I could), I’ll leave you with an awesome summary overheard coming from the mouth of a particularly observant kid, when asked how he would sum up 2020:

For an insightful rundown of bitcoin market developments in 2020, check out my colleague Bradley Keoun’s piece.

CHAIN LINKS

Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital has already invested $182 million in bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: The bitcoin fund’s brochure lists increasing adoption, lower risk, low interest rates and “unprecedented money printing” as some of the main reasons for bitcoin’s growing respectability. A quote from the brochure: “Bitcoin is digital gold. It is better at being gold than gold.”

BlackRock is seeking to hire a vice president to help build demand for the company’s crypto-related offerings. TAKEAWAY: The gotcha here is that BlackRock is planning crypto products! That would definitely signal mainstream institutional acceptance – it’s unlikely that BlackRock would take this step unless it had already seen some demand.

Fund manager VanEck has submitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. TAKEAWAY: VanEck has previously and unsuccessfully proposed exchange-traded funds, withdrawing its most recent application in September 2019. This latest attempt signals that the firm believes the environment is more favorable now than in the recent past, and we are likely to see other ETF managers submit further proposals in the coming months.

Earlier this week, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was briefly the largest bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, which reached $1.66 billion. TAKEAWAY: This is, in my view, the clearest signal that institutional interest in bitcoin is growing. At the beginning of 2020, the CME bitcoin futures open interest ranked fifth, well behind BitMEX, OKEx and Huobi. The daily volumes in the CME’s bitcoin futures, however, are well below the exchange’s Asian counterparts, which implies less trading and more strategic positioning than in crypto derivative exchanges outside the U.S.

Gazpromneft, the oil subsidiary of Russia’s natural gas giant Gazprom, has opened a venue for cryptocurrency mining on one of its oil drilling sites in Siberia. TAKEAWAY: So many threads to pull on here: 1) oil and gas producers seeing cryptocurrency mining as a diversification source; 2) the geographical spread of crypto mining activity; 3) Gazprom is a state-owned enterprise, getting involved (albeit indirectly) in cryptocurrency mining.

Canadian augmented reality (AR) company NexTech AR (NTAR) plans to use its treasury funds to buy $2 million worth of bitcoin for “capital diversification.” TAKEAWAY: This is not as big a bet as MicroStrategy (MSTR) has made this year, since this amount is only approximately 15% of the available cash on hand at the end of Q3. The firm’s CEO said that he sees bitcoin as having more long-term appreciation potential than simply holding cash. We will most likely see more announcements like this over the coming months.

National Football League player Russell Okung will get half of his $13 million annual salary in bitcoin, via crypto startup Zap, whose Strike product enables traditional paychecks to be converted to bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: Apart from the high-profile publicity this gives bitcoin (and we are likely to see more athletes making crypto-related announcements over the coming months), it is also a sign of the widening breadth of products for a market beyond institutions. According to Zap’s CEO, Strike can now be used as a checking account through partnerships with two yet-to-be-named banks. What’s more, Okung’s advocacy for bitcoin is not news – he launched the bitcoinis project which writes and hosts meetups about cryptocurrency – so we can expect to see more buzz-generating public comments next year.

For those of us working in the industry, it’s been fun in a smug sort of way watching the number of declarations of bitcoin’s failure and imminent death. The website 99bitcoins.com has tracked bitcoin “obituaries,” and now shows that cynics are flagging. TAKEAWAY: This is understandable since bitcoin has weathered a few winters and market slumps. It’s also a pity, since an overlooked benefit of criticism is that it forces us to improve our explanations. There is still a lot of education to do; but it seems that there is now more career risk in dissing bitcoin than in suggesting that clients invest.

(Bloomberg) -- For investment firms that profit by buying the debt of troubled companies, it looked like the opportunity of a lifetime: a $1 trillion pile of distressed bonds and loans in the Americas alone as the pandemic sent markets into meltdown last March.But after a massive federal bailout and rock-bottom interest rates kept even some of the shakiest companies afloat, those juicy targets have shriveled to less than $100 billion. That’s left distressed-debt specialists -- who at one point last year had $131 billion to spend -- rummaging for increasingly elusive bargains. Even the real estate sector, which was hammered after the pandemic shuttered offices, hotels and stores, has managed for now to avoid an epic wipeout.So, how are distressed-debt investors -- often among of the savviest in the markets -- deploying all that cash? A few, like Caspian Capital, decided to return some money to investors because the rewards wouldn’t justify the high risks anymore.Others are looking farther afield. Olympus Peak Asset Management is dipping into things like unpaid vendor claims in firms that are already bankrupt. Arena Investors is picking through convertible bonds and real estate loans cast off by banks. And giants of the business like Oaktree Capital Management are rustling around in Asia for opportunities.“People aren’t investing, they’re just chasing,” said Adam Cohen, Caspian’s managing partner. And this comes with an extra helping of risk, according to Oaktree co-founder Howard Marks, the dean of distressed investing. “To get to higher returns these days, you have to be willing to extend credit to somebody who is not clearly coming back,” Marks said in a Bloomberg TV interview.The money nevertheless continues to roll in, and managers have made some progress at finding new places to put it. About 40 funds -- from Oaktree to Angelo Gordon & Co. -- collected about $35 billion between this year and last, according to consultants at Preqin.For Arena Investors, a $2.2 billion investment firm, going smaller and nimble has had its advantages, said Chief Executive Officer Dan Zwirn. That’s because 80% of distressed companies in early April had less than $1 billion of debt outstanding, and about 60% of the companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year owed less than $500 million. That’s left too many larger firms chasing the few big situations that are left.“When you’re writing checks above $100 million, the level of competition is excessive,” Zwirn said.Arena deployed almost all of the $519 million it raised for a special opportunities strategy last year, targeting industries dislocated by the pandemic. Among the things they’ve been active in: real estate loans, special-situation lending in energy and aviation and litigation finance.Tighter LendingFund managers like Olympus Peak are also looking at companies that are too small to tap into the seemingly limitless bond and equity markets, which were supercharged last year by the unprecedented wave of federal stimulus.Large public-market borrowers have been mostly picked over by now. Smaller companies, on the other hand, have relied more on banks for liquidity. And the percentage of banks making it tougher to get a loan is still high at 11.4%, according to the Federal Reserve, well above the 1.9% average since the great financial crisis.“If you can only do public-market distress, you just have to hold your position, because if you sell it, there’s nothing else to buy,” said Jason Dillow, chief executive officer at the $8.4 billion Bardin Hill Investment Partners.Biggest Distressed/Special Situations Funds of 2020-2021Either way, distressed fund managers are trying a variety of tactics to drum up returns, according to people familiar with the portfolios:Bardin Hill raised $600 million for privately negotiated credit in early February and deployed about 78% of it. The cash went into high-end cruise lines, fitness, technology, health care and education, along with alternative assets such as insurance-backed claims.Olympus Peak, which runs a $1.4 billion hedge fund, started a $300 million fund this month focused on vendor claims that arise out of bankruptcies. So-called trade claims are often small, illiquid and labor-intensive, and thus less attractive for a larger fund.Angelo Gordon collected $3.5 billion at the beginning of the pandemic and invested all of it, plus $1 billion in recycled capital. It favored privately negotiated financings with high yields and strong protections for its investment written into its agreements.Centerbridge Partners’ Special Credit III strategy invested $1.8 billion in March and April of 2020. It has since traded out of 90% of those positions. The cash was redeployed into growth companies such as HCI Group Inc. and rescue financing for businesses such as cinema chains, including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., its U.K. subsidiary Odeon, and Cineworld Group Plc.As of February, Monarch Alternative Capital had invested more than 60% of the $3 billion it raised last year for its latest distressed credit fund. The firm lent to bankrupt businesses after the pandemic shut them down temporarily. The roster included a franchisee for Wendy’s and Pizza Hut, Ann Taylor’s parent company Ascena Retail Group, and the owner of Chuck E. Cheese, with Monarch looking beyond the pandemic and at times boosting its investment to keep the companies afloat.D.E. Shaw & Co. raised $1 billion for its latest private credit fund that targets stressed assets and financings with a 5-year investment window, the firm said Tuesday.For Cohen’s $3.5 billion Caspian Capital, distressed-debt investing is too narrow a mandate in today’s world, so the firm broadened into firms that are merely stressed. It’s looking for 10% to 15% yields, or credits that trade between 70 and 90 cents on the dollar but aren’t in default.Even with that wider purview, Caspian decided to close its $500 million dislocation strategy fund after cashing out when prices rebounded. Investors got back $565 million.“Money always burns a hole in your pocket,” Cohen said. “The best thing you can do now is not make a mistake. That can save you a lot more money than mediocre trades can make you.”To be sure, firms with patient capital don’t have to invest right away, and there could be a bigger wave of opportunities after policymakers scale back economic support, according to JPMorgan Asset Management’s David Lebovitz.In the meantime, Oaktree is looking to raise $15 billion for its latest distressed fund and put its money to work outside the U.S. So far, public filings show, only about 10% of its pledged capital was drawn as of February. Oaktree’s pitch to investors cited almost $5 trillion in opportunities across Asia, mostly China, including non-performing loans, bonds, shadow-banking loans and leveraged loans.The lingering question is whether the distressed assets that remain are destined for a recovery, or whether they’re simply being kept afloat by an historic dead-cat bounce that won’t last.“If you had a fundamentally strong business, you could’ve found the liquidity to make it through the challenges of 2020,” Chris Acito, chief investment officer of Gapstow Capital Partners, a New York-based firm that specializes in picking credit-fund managers. “Many of the businesses which are still in distress have flawed business models that will be difficult to revive.”(Updates with D.E.

The cryptocurrency bitcoin jumped to $33,834 on Sunday at around 4 p.m., according to CoinGecko, after hitting $30,000 for the first time in its history the day before.

""Bitcoin's rise isn't surprising in the least -- it's been a buildup of credibility and sustainability, with strong network effects,"" said Dave Balter, the CEO of Flipside Crypto, in an email to TheStreet on Sunday.

The world of institutional finance ""has finally taken notice"" of crypto, added Balter, whose firm posts regular columns in TheStreet.

""No one wants to be last to the dance,"" he added.

The move up over the New Year's weekend comes after a mid-December high that topped $20,000. Bitcoin has more than tripled in value over the past year, and was up 26.6% over just the past seven days.

When asked if the surge in bitcoin could lead to the increase in value of other crypto projects such as ethereum and litecoin -- which were both up on Sunday -- Balter said it was likely that this rising tide could lift all boats.

""Bitcoin does tend to create a 'wake' for other crypto assets to follow, so my strong belief is you'll see rise in prices from a number of quality projects.""

Some financial experts have suggested that one reason why bitcoin has seen a dramatic hike in value is the uncertainty created by recent high-profile cyber hacks and the Covid-19 pandemic.

The cryptocurrency, which is now about a dozen years old, has also gained widespread mainstream attention recently, as big players such as PayPal (PYPL) - Get Report and Visa (V) - Get Report have begun offering crypto services and more and more online retailers accept the currency.

Balter also notes big momentum toward the end of last year for the crypto currency, including the crypto exchange Coinbase's progress toward an initial public offering, SkyBridge Capital's launch of a bitcoin fund, and words of confidence in the currency by advisers such as Ric Edelman.

Despite the holiday jump in value, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) - Get Report had closed down on Thursday to around $32, though it too had surged year-to-date by more than 270%.

This story has been updated.","What Happened: Ethereum (ETH), the second leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has gained over 18.19% in the last 24 hours and was trading at $951.85 at press time, with a current capitalization at over $103 billion.

The price of ETH has been going up since Dec. 24, just after it fell to $572, according to TradingView data. Its all-time high was reached in January 2018, when the price soared to $1,432.

Gemini crypto exchange founder and billionaire Cameron Winklevoss touted Ethereum's strength in a tweet on Friday.

$ETH was the best performing asset (up 450%) of 2020 hands down and still below its all-time high. Today it’s the equivalent of 15K #Bitcoin I would take that bet all day long — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) January 1, 2021

What Happened To Dogecoin: Meanwhile, after its 125% meteoric rise in one day yesterday, Dogecoin (DOGE) was trading at $0.0106 at press time, down 10% since the high of $0.0133 that it hit Saturday.

Dogecoin is currently ranked 26th among 8,164 cryptocurrencies in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap.

It previously rose 20% after Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tweeted about it on Dec. 20.

Total Crypto Market: Overall, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has reached $873 billion as of today, with the top ten cryptocurrencies in the green at press time, including Tether (USDT), XRP, Litecoin (LTC) and Polkadot (DOT).

Also, Bitcoin today hit another all-time high, surpassing $34,000 for a period during the day.

Bitcoin's near 300% surge in 2020 could be followed up by an even stronger performance in 2021, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.

In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Lee said bitcoin could quadruple in 2021 as the crypto asset experiences a similar parabolic setup that occurred in 2017.

""2021 is going to be a lot like 2017 which means bitcoin should do even better in 2021 than it did in 2020, so something above 300%,"" Lee told CNBC.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Following a strong 2020 that saw bitcoin march to all time highs for a gain of around 300%, 2021 could be even stronger.

That's according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that he sees bitcoin surging another 300% next year.

At its current price of about $29,000, a quadruple in bitcoin would put the crypto asset well above the $100,000 mark at $116,000.

Driving bitcoin higher would be a similar setup to what was seen in 2017: a parabolic rally. Lee tweeted that the halvening of 2020 makes this year most similar to 2016, which also experienced a halvening. A halvening in bitcoin is when the reward for miners completing problems on the bitcoin blockchain is cut in half.

2021 will be most like 2017 in that bitcoin will likely experience a ""parabolic rise,"" Lee tweeted.

Fundstrat's digital asset strategist David Grider also raised his outlook for bitcoin in a note on Wednesday, expecting the crypto asset to hit at least $40,000 next year.

""We believe the conditions remain in place for a continued rally in bitcoin and crypto more broadly over the next 6-12 months. Institutional and corporate buying, regulatory de-risking and retail stimulus demand are factors that have led to an increase in positive momentum, which we believe can continue,"" Grider said.

But if the stock market corrects next year, the positive outlook for bitcoin may deteriorate, according to Lee.

""Bitcoin acts like a risk on asset, so in the years where the S&P performs the best are also the best years for bitcoin. So I think if we have a correction in stocks then bitcoin is going to fall,"" Lee explained.

2021-01-04,"Bitcoin is pulling back from its record highs. The cryptocurrency briefly dipped below $30,000 Monday, just two days after breaching that level for the first time.

The price of bitcoin rallied to a fresh all-time high over the weekend, topping the $34,000 mark. That move was followed by a surge in smaller cryptocurrencies such as ether, which passed the $1,000 mark for the first time since February 2018.

Bitcoin slumped as low as $29,316 at around 5:40 a.m. ET Monday, falling 12% in the last 24 hours. It later went back above the $30,000 level, paring losses to trade at around $31,420, but was still down more than 6%.

""The most likely explanation for a pullback is short term profit taking by traders, rather than long term investors,"" Jason Deane, an analyst at crypto advisory firm Quantum Economics, told CNBC by email. ""Given the current sentiment and appetite for Bitcoin, it seems likely that any correction will be short lived.""","Nur Photo/Getty Images

Bitcoin plummeted as much as 17% on Monday, its biggest single-day decline since March.

Bitcoin hit a record high of $34,792.47 on Sunday. The cryptocurrency had soared by 171% in the fourth quarter and by 305% in 2020.

Some analysts said that after the stellar gains of the past month, some crypto coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum were due for a downward correction.

Bitcoin plunged as much as 17% on Monday, its biggest single-day decline since March. It fell back below $30,000 at intraday lows after hitting a record high of $34,792.47 on Sunday.

The cryptocurrency is experiencing severe volatility on the heels of a 171% surge in the fourth quarter of 2020. Bitcoin also notched astronomical gains in 2020; its 305% return made it one of the top-performing assets of the year.

Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, rose by as much as 22%, to $1,161.36, its highest level since 2018. Ethereum performed even more robustly than Bitcoin in 2020, rising more than 600%.

""The long-term outlook for both bitcoin and Ethereum remains skewed to the topside,"" said Daniel Moss, an analyst at DailyFX. ""However, both cryptocurrencies could be at risk of a near-term pullback as their respective surges appear relatively overextended.""

Despite Bitcoin's Monday struggles, some experts expect a weak dollar, turbulence across traditional financial markets, and a greater shift in business and commerce online to help fuel further gains. A growing number of prominent investors and entrepreneurs have thrown their weight behind it, including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Paul Tudor Jones, and even Ray Dalio, who had been something of a crypto skeptic.

A key catalyst in 2020 was the online payments company PayPal allowing its users to buy and sell Bitcoin across its platform.

Smaller cryptocurrencies have benefited from this push and on Monday showed strong gains. Ripple's XRP was up as much as 10%, and Litecoin climbed by 12% at Monday highs.

On Sunday, the value of Bitcoin surged to £24,850 ($34,000) for the first time. This comes after the leading cryptocurrency increased in value by 300% in 2020, despite a 50% drop off in March.

However, since this record weekend the value of Bitcoin has dropped by 10%, wiping more than $90 billion of its value — highlighting the volatility of the crypto market.

Coinciding with Bitcoin’s surge, which is still significant despite the drop off in value on Monday, other cryptocurrencies are also seeing a rise in value.

According to Coindesk, Ethereum — the second biggest cryptocurrency with a market value of $114.2 billion — hit a nearly three-year high of $1,001.23, up 29.4% over the last 48 hours. In 2020, it gained 465%.

So, what has caused this recent surge in the value of some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies?

Some suggest that the sharp rise seen since the beginning of the year is attributed to big investors seeking to make quick profits. This would usually be followed by a quick downturn. But, as reported in the BBC, some analysts think Bitcoin’s value could rise even higher as the US Dollar’s valuation drops further.

Quick profit or the future of payments?

Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies are traded in virtually the same way as traditional or ‘real’ currencies. And, just like real currencies, their value is impacted by world events.

In March 2020 investors turned to traditional currencies, like the US Dollar, amidst the major uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic — this coincided in a downturn in the value of certain cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin.

However, following a major stimulus package from the US Federal Reserve and the uncertainty created by the presidential transition, the US Dollar’s value has dropped and digital currencies’ value is on the rise.

The cryptocurrency market is volatile, but for a long time businesses have seen it’s value and pledged commitments to adopt it as a form of online payments.

For example, in October 2020, PayPal announced it would allow it’s customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

“Over the past year, we’ve seen more and more prestigious names expressing a financial interest in Bitcoin. Most have noted Bitcoin’s scarce properties as one of its most attractive features. This, coupled with a global increase in money printing to ease the societal damage of coronavirus has certainly contributed to Bitcoin’s surge,” commented Oliver Jones, Financial Controller at GlobalBlock, a cryptocurrency trading platform.

He added: “More than ever, we are seeing institutional investors buying from trading platforms like GlobalBlock, which I think sets this surge apart from 2017. Investors are looking at Bitcoin with a medium to long term outlook and won’t be panic selling if they see the price drop — they can appreciate the long term value in this unique asset.”

It would appear that institutional investors are taking note and also backing virtual currencies as a viable investment for the future. However, the meteoric rise in value seen over the last year and the beginning of this year, might hint that a major correction is on the horizon — similar to what happened at the turn of the year in 2017/18.

Ether, the digital token of the Ethereum blockchain, climbed past the $1,000 mark Monday to hit its highest level since Feb. 2, 2018. Ether was last trading at $1,038, up 30% in the last 24 hours, according to data from crypto news site CoinDesk.

It comes after bitcoin notched a fresh all-time high, briefly topping the $34,000 mark. The world's biggest cryptocurrency by market value rallied to $34,452 early Sunday before easing to around $31,780 on Monday.

Even XRP, the virtual currency linked with controversial blockchain start-up Ripple, was climbing Monday. XRP was last up around 7% in the last 24 hours, trading at around 23 cents.

Bitcoin and Ethereum prices dropped all the weekend gains before the traditional markets opened for trading Monday, liquidating $1.1 billion leveraged orders.

Nevertheless, market sentiments continue to wax bullish despite the carnage.

Bullish Bitcoin, Ethereum Selling

On Sunday at 5 PM CST, the CME futures market opened with a gap of $4,000 since closing at $29,385 before the holidays on Dec. 31.

Bitcoin crossed $30,000 for the first time over the weekend, topping at $34,800 this morning. However, the correction came just as quickly, as BTC prices dropped 20% around 1 AM CST.

Bitcoin futures on CME prices traced back to $28,440, filling the positive gap.

The volatility in Ethereum was even stronger as the second-largest cryptocurrency topped $1,150 for the first time in three years. The price of ETH, however, corrected 23% to $900 after peaking at $1,170.

Across exchanges like Binance and Huobi, over $1.1 billion were liquidated in the last four hours, with Bitcoin longs accounting for nearly 93.6% of the amount.

A 30-40% correction has been a standard in Bitcoin bull markets, which seldom run on over-leveraged longs across these platforms.

For example, the funding rate for Ethereum longs on BitMEX—even after the drop—is close to 474% annually. Similarly, for Bitcoin, the funding rates are running above 70% annually. Moreover, a quick recovery above $30,000 after the CME gap fill is seen as a robust bullish signal.

While the bullish market sentiments seem unhinged by the correction, the high funding rate for long orders on futures markets can act as a catalyst for additional correction. Todays’ low, around $27,750, will act as support for a positive trend.

","What happened

The price of popular cryptocurrency bitcoin has more than tripled over the last three months. This has sparked a recent surge in the prices of other cryptocurrencies -- collectively known as alt-coins -- such as Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Ether is up over 50% just since Christmas Day.

As a reminder, bitcoin and Ether can be bought and sold every day around the clock, whereas stocks only trade during market hours. Bitcoin and Ether have started 2021 off strong, up more than 10% and 30% respectively. A big portion of these moves came over the weekend, but stocks couldn't move until Monday when the market opened. Now, many crypto-related stocks are making big moves. Consider these movements as of 2:15 p.m. EST:

Marathon Patent Group NASDAQ:MARA)

Ebang International Holdings NASDAQ:EBON)

Bit Digital NASDAQ:BTBT)

Canaan NASDAQ:CAN)

Each stock is going up thanks to the rising prices of cryptocurrencies. But will this always be the case?

So what

Marathon and Bit Digital are bitcoin mining companies. The bitcoin blockchain network is decentralized and is only able to run because of the computing power supplied by operations like Marathon and Bit Digital. These are compensated for their services in bitcoin by design. Both companies can increase the amount of bitcoin they receive by increasing their computing power, either by purchasing more hardware or acquiring a fellow mining operation.

However, even without increasing computing power, it's easy to see why it's good for Marathon and Bit Digital when the price of bitcoin goes up. Their expenses remain the same, and they're compensated the same amount of bitcoin. But that bitcoin is worth more, resulting in increased revenue. This is why investors are getting excited and sending these two stocks higher.

Ebang and Canaan manufacture hardware that can be used for bitcoin mining. That's a bad business to be in when no one is buying or upgrading their equipment. Consider that Canaan's revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was down 76% year over year to a mere $24 million. Ebang most recently gave results for the first half of 2020, reporting revenue of just $11 million, a 51% drop.

Both Ebang and Canaan reported drops in the amount of computing power sold as well. However, Canaan's wasn't as bad as its overall revenue drop. That said, inventory glut resulted in lower average selling prices, explaining the outsized revenue drop. But perhaps these companies are poised to sell more hardware in coming months as cryptocurrencies heat up. That's why investors are excited about these two stocks.

To add to the excitement surrounding Ebang, it made waves on Dec. 31 when it announced the upcoming launch of its cryptocurrency exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange allows people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The company expects it to launch in the first quarter of this year. This undoubtedly is playing a part in sending the stock higher today.

Now what

It's crucial for investors to distinguish between why stocks are moving today and what will make them move in the long term. To be clear, these two things aren't necessarily the same.

It's true that rising cryptocurrency values is good for bitcoin mining operations like Marathon and Bit Digital. And improving business fundamentals for bitcoin miners is good for those supplying the mining hardware like Ebang and Canaan. However, when investing in stocks, there are more factors that also influence future movements sooner or later.

For starters, I believe all four of these stocks are wildly overvalued at the moment, trading at nose-bleed price-to-sales valuations. This is called valuation risk and it basically means these stocks could fall to a more reasonable valuation, regardless of what happens with the price of bitcoin in the future.

Granted, many of my favorite stocks are considered expensive when looking at their price-to-sales ratios. However, the stocks I like are also great businesses with explosive profit potential. By contrast, these stocks aren't great businesses because they don't control the most important element of their business: the price of bitcoin. Furthermore, bitcoin mining and hardware manufacturing has a checkered past regarding profitability.

The only thing that remotely interests me is Ebang's cryptocurrency exchange. As a technology platform, it could have good margins. However, it hasn't even launched yet -- that's far too early to invest in my opinion.

Finally, remember that when we invest in stocks, we invest in the management teams at those companies. This is particularly important here because Bit Digital, Canaan, and Ebang are all based in China. Chinese companies on U.S. stock exchanges will likely be subject to financial audits going forward due to the passing of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. Investors in these international stocks should not just have confidence in the future price of bitcoin, but also in these management teams' ability to comply. Failure to do so could send these stocks plummeting even if bitcoin keeps rising.

These are just a few reasons I consider Marathon, Bit Digital, Ebang, and Canaan stocks risky investments, even though I believe cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ether could keep heading higher.",
2021-01-05,"At the beginning of 2020, the prospects for Bitcoin (BTCUSD), and by extension cryptocurrency markets, did not look too bright. Both were fitfully attempting to shake off a prolonged price slump and a rise in crypto crime. Market liquidity remained low, and institutional investors were still shying away from cryptocurrencies.

Then the pandemic happened. Multiple rounds of unchecked stimulus spending by central banks shook Bitcoin from its price stupor and strengthened its economic proposition as a store of value. Its price coasted past the $20,000 record, set nearly three years ago during a booming economy, in early December and has skyrocketed by more than 200% since the beginning of this year.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency markets have jumped to $760 billion, a hair's breadth away from their $800 billion valuations in 2017, moving up significantly up from their $185 billion market cap at the start of this year.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices skyrocketed to new highs in 2020 as fears of macroeconomic instability drove investors toward new asset classes.

Bitcoin was a major beneficiary as institutional investors and banks announced investments into the cryptocurrency and its trading ecosystem.

However, the crypto ecosystem is still plagued by several problems, such as scams and low liquidity.

What Caused the Increase in Bitcoin Price?

Several developments created a perfect storm for Bitcoin and crypto markets to thrive during the second half of this year.

Chief among them was (and continues to be) central bank policy during the pandemic shutdown. Analysts have cited macroeconomic instability resulting from unchecked stimulus during the economic shutdown and low interest rates as major reasons for investors to put their money into Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's scarcity contrasts with the flurry of spending by central banks around the world. This monetary policy tactic could debase the value of fiat currencies and lead to rampant inflation.

Institutional investors adopted a risk-on profile amid an economic environment marked by low-interest rates and fear of macroeconomic turbulence. In their search for investable assets, investors re-evaluated their original assessments of Bitcoin and bolstered its trading infrastructure.

Unlike Bitcoin's 2017 price rise, when the chorus was mostly negative, the accompaniment this time around has been positive. The upshot is that some institutional investors are now betting on Bitcoin. They were not the only ones. Publicly listed companies like Square, Inc. (SQ) and MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR) also invested in Bitcoin, the latter company making it a prominent part of its treasury management strategy.

This year also marked a seminal event in Bitcoin's young history. Another Bitcoin halving slowed the rate at which Bitcoin is produced, thereby reducing the cryptocurrency's overall supply in the market. Generally, the event is accompanied by a price bump. But it is a measure of this strange year that the event, which was supposed to have witnessed record inflows, barely produced a blip in crypto markets. Still, the supply reduction helped set up the circumstances for Bitcoin's later price leap.

Will This Time Be Different?

As much as things have changed from 2017, they also remain the same. Bitcoin price is still irascibly volatile. In the past week alone, the cryptocurrency has added roughly $100 billion to its overall market cap while whizzing past $29,000.

That volatility is fertile ground for criminals and scammers. Hackers and fraudsters had made off with funds totaling $1.8 billion by October from cryptocurrency markets and ecosystems. Ripple's XRP (XRPUSD), the third biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is also being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an unlawful sale of securities.

Though a lesser issue today while using larger exchanges, a liquidity problem remains. Price disparity between crypto exchanges continues to exist. Even as they have shed their inhibitions about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, institutional investors are still wary of committing fully. Record inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) are proof. The trust offers indirect exposure to Bitcoin for investors, saving them the hassle and cost of owning Bitcoin. In turn, they become crypto tourists, able to crest a rising trade and exit it when price falls.

After multiple attempts at a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), San Francisco-based Bitwise Asset Management also jumped ship this year to launch a crypto index fund. While the proliferation of such investment vehicles offers institutional investors the chance to profit from Bitcoin and crypto, the seasonality of investments directed at them ensures that crypto's liquidity problem will persist.","Why did this happen?

Bitcoin holds the potential for significant additional gains over the long term, with the possibility of its price rising as high as $146,000 as institutional investors continue to pad their portfolios with the cryptocurrency at the expense of gold.

In a research note to clients, analysts at JPMorgan Chase predicted a long-term bitcoin price target of more than $146,000 based on the assumption that the cryptocurrency will grow in popularity as an alternative to gold, which has traditionally been used as an inflation and volatility hedge, as well as protection against a falling U.S. dollar.

“A crowding out of gold as an ‘alternative’ currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term,” wrote JPMorgan Chase strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. However, “a convergence in volatilities between bitcoin and gold is unlikely to happen quickly, and is in our mind a multiyear process.

“This implies that the above $146,000 theoretical bitcoin price target should be considered as a long-term target, and thus an unsustainable price target for this year,” they said.

The price of bitcoin breached a record high of $34,000 this past weekend, quadruple its value at the start of 2020, amid ongoing demand from institutional investors, who have pivoted to including the traditionally volatile security in their investment portfolios.

Bitcoin slid as much as 17% on Monday, its biggest drop since March. As of 9 a.m. ET Tuesday the price was $31,338.64, down 1.54%, according to CoinDesk.

By JPMorgan’s calculations, bitcoin’s total market capitalization would have to rise by another 4.6 times to match the total private sector investment in gold via exchange-traded funds or bars and coins. However, that forecast depends on the volatility of bitcoin converging with that of gold, something that will take quite some time, given how frothy bitcoin remains.

“While we cannot exclude the possibility that the current speculative mania will propagate further pushing the bitcoin price up toward the consensus region of between $50,000-$100,000, we believe that such price levels would prove unsustainable,” JPMorgan said, adding that bitcoin’s valuation and position backdrop “has become a lot more challenging” in 2021.

That said, cryptocurrency insiders including Flipside Crypto CEO Dave Balter also have attributed bitcoin's momentum to other factors, including the crypto exchange Coinbase's progress toward an initial public offering, Anthony Scaramucci's SkyBridge Capital's launch of a bitcoin fund, and words of confidence in the digital currency by advisers such as Ric Edelman.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) ended the trading day Monday up 9.63% at $35.08.","Bitcoin on a mound of gold. bodnarchuk | iStock Editorial | Getty Images

Bitcoin's remarkable ascent past $30,000 has stunned Wall Street — and one of the biggest U.S. investment banks thinks the digital currency could have much further to run. In a note published Monday, JPMorgan made a bold long-term price target for bitcoin, claiming the red-hot cryptocurrency could rally as high as $146,000 as it competes with gold as an ""alternative"" currency. But, there's a catch. Bitcoin's market cap — calculated by multiplying the price by the total number of coins in circulation — currently stands at more than $575 billion. According to JPMorgan, it would have to climb by 4.6 times to match the $2.7 trillion of private sector gold investment. For bitcoin's market value to reach that level, its price volatility would need to drop substantially to give institutional investors the confidence required to make large bets. Bitcoin is known for its wild volatility, and it fell sharply Monday to briefly dip below $30,000 just days after reaching that level. Bitcoin was up 1% in the last 24 hours Tuesday, trading at around $31,720, according to data from crypto market data provider Coin Metrics.

""This long term upside based on an equalization of the market cap of bitcoin to that of gold for investment purposes is conditional on the volatility of bitcoin converging to that of gold over the long term,"" JPMorgan's strategists wrote. ""The reason is that, for most institutional investors, the volatility of each class matters in terms of portfolio risk management and the higher the volatility of an asset class, the higher the risk capital consumed by this asset class."" Crypto bulls have said that bitcoin's recent rally is markedly different than a late 2017 bubble that saw it zoom close to $20,000 a coin, only to sink as low as $3,122 the next year. That's because institutional investors are starting to buy in, and this is seen as a crucial confidence boost for the digital asset. Skeptics view bitcoin's 2020 rally — which saw it advance more than 300% — as reminiscent of the frothy 2017 market action. They see it as a speculative asset with no intrinsic value and a bubble that is likely to burst at some point. Still, JPMorgan says there's ""little doubt that the institutional flow impulse into bitcoin is what distinguishes 2020 from 2017.""","Digital asset manager Grayscale Investments sold all XRP in its Digital Large Cap Fund at the end of December, according to a statement today.

XRP amounted for about 1.5% of the fund. Grayscale sold all its XRP to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.

Now, the fund’s components include over 80% Bitcoin, 15% Ethereum, 1.4% Litecoin and just over 1% of Bitcoin Cash.

Many exchanges in the US have already suspended trading of XRP, citing the lawsuit, including Coinbase and Bitstamp. Some exchanges in the US have delisted it fully, including Binance.US, Crypto.com and Bittrex.","Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twiter and financial services company Square, on Monday, raised concerns over proposed regulations for certain digital asset transactions in a comment letter addressed to the policy division of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

What Happened: Under the proposed guidelines, financial intermediaries are tasked with gathering personal data like names and physical addresses of parties involved in large digital asset transactions.

Dorsey states that the proposed regulations “would require cryptocurrency service providers like Square to keep records of and report certain cryptocurrency transaction information far beyond what is required for cash transactions today.”

The entrepreneur, a long-term backer of bitcoin, also believes that the rule could lead to the collection of unreliable data from non-customers.

Why Does It Matter: The entrepreneur believes that FinCEN’s latest proposal can cause uncertainty, which could drive cryptocurrency enthusiasts to use unregulated third-party wallets, including ones hosted outside the U.S.

The new rules would “drive cryptocurrency activity away from regulated entities and push cryptocurrency transactions to offshore and other unregulated channels that are much more (if not entirely) opaque to FinCEN and law enforcement,” as per Dorsey.

Additionally, the cumbersome data collection process would not only stifle innovation but also place an additional burden on the service provider.

With a surge in bitcoin prices, the cryptocurrency domain is witnessing heightened investor interest. From approximately $7,300 at the start of January 2020, Bitcoin has surged above $31,880 to date to record a 337% surge.

Apart from Square, PayPal and MicroStrategy were some of the other mainstream companies that drove interest in cryptocurrency in 2020.

Many more institutions and fairly large publicly listed companies like MacroStrategy Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR), entered the crypto space in 2020, which was marked by great socio-economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The digital assets market cap currently stands at over $860 billion, with Bitcoin dominance reaching nearly 70% – which means that the flagship cryptocurrency has captured the majority of the nascent market with a market cap of over $585 billion at the time of writing. The Bitcoin price continues to set new all-time highs and is presently trading at around $31,667, according to CoinGecko data.

What Does the Current Crypto Bull Market Mean for the Digital Assets and Blockchain Industry?

Bitcoin is not the only crypto-asset that’s surging this year. Ethereum, the world’s second-largest digital currency, now has a market cap of over $117 billion and ETH is trading at more than $1,000 for the first time since early 2018 when it briefly surged to around $1,400 before crashing hard along with the rest of the crypto market a couple of years back.

While we have seen similar prices during the historic crypto market bull run of 2017 (and now much higher BTC prices), there’s a lot that has changed fundamentally since that time. It can be argued that the late 2017 and early 2018 rally was based on a lot of speculation and driven by many eager retail traders.

But after the Bitcoin and larger crypto market crashed badly during the extended bear market of 2018, most of the companies and platform developers began re-evaluating their strategies. At that time, there were a number of serious issues that needed to be addressed before the crypto market could rise again and gain more meaningful adoption among the masses.

As most industry participants would know, there were numerous scams carried out under the guise of initial coin offering (ICOs) and this trend continued later on (for the most part) in the form of initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Like ICOs, IEOs were more about “speculation and trading” than fundraising and project development, according to an extensive blockchain industry report.

These fraudulent activities led to losses worth billions of dollars for unsuspecting investors. The crypto space has endured some of the largest scams ever orchestrated including Bitconnect, the multi-billion dollar PlusToken scam, among many others. These malicious and highly damaging activities made it abundantly clear that the crypto industry was badly in need of a proper and clear regulatory framework.

As we head into 2021, leading digital asset exchange Binance has announced that it plans to continue taking regulations more seriously, but multiple warnings from regulators suggest otherwise. This year, we can expect a lot more regulatory scrutiny, especially from regulators like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and also from UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – which has also begun to crack down on unauthorized businesses pretending or posing to be licensed.

As the digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) industry continues to mature, we can expect that regulators will develop a much better and clearer understanding of these open-source protocols. With more awareness of how these technologies will impact the broader financial markets, regulators like the SEC and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) can begin drafting more suitable guidelines for blockchain and crypto-assets.

It’s worth noting, however, that some recent regulatory actions taken by FinCEN, like their proposed new rules for self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets, seemed quite rushed and unjustified according to many industry professionals. Despite these challenges, it does seem that we can look forward to more productive dialogue or progressive discussions as we move forward.

Recently, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) revealed that it will basically treat permissionless, DLT networks like SWIFT or other traditional providers when conducting cross-border transactions. This could potentially mean that international funds transfers, which can take several business days, could be completed almost instantly. Clearly, there have been many positive developments on the regulatory front which suggest that we can expect a more well-regulated industry in the foreseeable future.

We Can Expect More Companies to Add Bitcoin (BTC) to Their Balance Sheets

Many companies have come forward to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet. Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has now added billions of dollars worth of BTC to their treasury. Several other large firms have done the same or are planning to do so in the future.

It appears that this trend began to really take off in 2020. When awareness about the Coronavirus crisis became more widespread in late February and March 2020, and the global financial markets crashed to historic lows, many more individuals and businesses realized that they needed to explore alternative forms of investments and look for other ways to hedge against unprecedented levels of volatility and economic uncertainty.

Expect Bitcoin to Be Used More Often As Store of Value

While other digital currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin SV (BSV) allow investors to diversify their investment portfolios, these assets have not proven to be legitimate alternatives or options when it comes to serving as a reliable long-term store-of-value (SoV). Only BTC, which has the world’s largest and most secure crypto network, and potentially Ethereum (ETH) now to some extent, have shown that they’re able to hold value and even appreciate in value dramatically over longer periods of time.

According to well-known investor Raoul Paul, there’s no other asset besides Bitcoin (and Ethereum to a certain extent) that can potentially deliver 10x or higher returns within a span of a few years. Paul, who now holds the majority of his net worth in Bitcoin and Ethereum, believes that these assets provide an excellent risk-to-return ratio.

Expect Ethereum-dominated DeFi to Gain More Users and Use-Cases

In addition to cryptocurrencies being used as a hedge against the traditional financial markets, which have seen historic levels of money printing by reserve banks across the globe, we can expect the Ethereum-dominated decentralized finance (DeFi) space to continue to grow rapidly. In early January 2020, the entire DeFi market had only around $600 million in total value locked (TVL) into various DLT-enabled smart contracts. At present, there’s more than $14 billion in TVL captured by various DeFi protocols such as Aave, Maker, Uniswap, Compound, Synthetix, SushiSwap, Balancer, Yearn.Finance, among many others.

Some of these platforms like Aave (AAVE) have even managed to acquire an electronic-money license from the UK’s FCA and have handled billions of dollars in deposits. Uniswap, a leading Ethereum-based non-custodial exchange, is now regularly handling billions in trading volume and offers support for a wide variety of ERC-20 tokens. In 2021, we can expect these platforms to gain even more users and we might see DeFi startups launch even more creative projects.

DeFi mania, which really kicked off during the summer months of 2020, was fueled by a lot of speculative trading and investments. There were also numerous scams and hacks of smart contracts associated with these DeFI networks which have primarily offered borrowing, lending, yield farming, and liquidity mining options (among other use cases).

More DeFi Hacks, Security Breaches Could take Place in 2021

This year, we might see a lot more ways that individuals and businesses can borrow, lend, or invest in DeFi-based platforms. But we shouldn’t be surprised if this experimentation leads to many more scams and hacks. The decentralized finance and wider crypto space is still in its early stages of development, which means that these protocols haven’t been thoroughly tested.

Andre Cronje, an Ethereum / DeFi architect who’s focused on the development of Yearn.Finance and Curve.Finance (among other initiatives), has even stated that he builds software mainly for himself and anyone who wants to use it should take responsibility and take precautions as needed. In other words, these open-source protocols require users to accept greater responsibility for their actions and if they lose their funds, then there’s usually no recourse. There’s normally no centralized provider they can depend on to recover their lost or stolen assets, because these platforms are supposed to be decentralized.

Expect More Efforts Directed Towards Greater Decentralization, Autonomy

The trend towards greater decentralization is being supported by various new platforms that are part of Web 3.0, which is an evolving set of standards for the Internet of the future. While Ethereum has played a leading role in the development of Web 3.0 protocols, there are other blockchain interoperability solutions being launched such as Cosmos (ATOM) and Polkadot (DOT). These DLT platforms aim to provide improved interactions and a lot more compatibility between separate or independent blockchain networks.

Although many Ethereum supporters claim that it’s not really necessary to have multiple chains, or even think only a very limited number of blockchains are needed to deploy decentralized applications (dApps), many developers are also chain agnostic, meaning they would rather let the end-users decide and choose which blockchains they’d prefer to work with, which could be many different ones at the same time.

It also makes sense that individuals and businesses would benefit from more choices like EOS, Tron, NEM, NEO, Kadena, Zilliqa to name a few, especially considering that Ethereum transaction fees have skyrocketed recently and the blockchain has become quite unusable due to large amounts of network traffic.

How to flex you are rich? You say, ""I just sent some #ETH to …"" Must be a huge amount to be worth the fees. For the rest of us plebs, we use #BSC. https://t.co/qiqoC6rrHa — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) January 4, 2021

It’s Still Early Days, so Expect More Problems

Although it’s been over 10 years since the launch of the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol, which is the very first blockchain-enabled platform, the industry is still in its early stages of growth, development, and adoption. Since we’re so early, there’s a pretty good chance we’ll see many more technical issues and other types of problems with Internet-based platforms, including extremely damaging security breaches – like the fairly recent one experienced by Ledger (a leading cryptocurrency wallet provider).

As reported, Ledger’s customer data, which included millions of user emails and other personal details, were leaked on a web forum. Although user funds weren’t stolen due to the hack, Ledger customers received many threatening emails that tried to extort money from the victims. Clearly, these are very serious issues but they do teach us that everyone must learn to take more responsibility for how they interact online and the type of information they’re sharing with different service providers.","Why did this happen?

LONDON (Reuters) - Trading volumes on major cryptocurrency exchanges hit a daily record on Monday of over $68 billion, research showed, highlighting the trading frenzy that has accompanied bitcoin’s charge to an all-time high.

Bitcoin hit a record high $34,800 on Sunday, building on a 2020 rally that saw it more than quadruple as bigger U.S. investors jumped into the market. It then fell sharply on Monday amid volatility in highly leveraged futures markets, before recovering losses.

The second-biggest cryptocurrency, ethereum, which tends to trade in tandem with bitcoin, also on Monday hit its highest level since January 2018, touching $1,170.

Overall daily trading volumes in cryptocurrencies hit $68.3 billion, the data from UK research firm CryptoCompare showed on Tuesday. Daily volumes had averaged $13.1 billion in 2020, the data showed.

Bitcoin’s record high came less than three weeks after it crossed $20,000 for the first time on Dec. 16.

Fuelling bitcoin’s rally has been the perception it can act as a hedge against the risk of inflation as governments and central banks turn on the stimulus taps to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. Its potential for fast gains also attracted demand.

Crypto trading volumes regularly spike during periods of extreme price swings, highlighting the central role for speculative traders in digital currency trading."
2021-01-06,"During the past week, the price of Ethereum has increased by 45%, Bitcoin - by almost 20%. Let's try to answer one of the main questions of traders and investors — what to do with assets now, will they continue to rise in price or will the correction begin?

On the night of Tuesday, January 5, the price of Bitcoin on the Binance crypto exchange exceeded $32.8 K, now it is $31.2 K. Over the past day, the cryptocurrency has risen in price by 6%, during a week - by almost 20%. On January 3, the price of the Bitcoin updated the historical maximum of $34.7 K.

At the same time, on the morning of January 4th, the exchange rate of the largest altcoin by capitalization, Ethereum, has reached $1.1 K for the first time since February 2018. A breakdown of the psychological resistance level of $1 K can open the way for the cryptocurrency to its historical maximum of $1.4 K, experts say. However, a decline in the price to $1 K and below in the near future may provoke a further fall to $838.

Regarding Bitcoin, it is worth to note that we should not expect a strong correction, FXOpen experts say. First, large crypto investors do not sell their coins, but on the contrary, withdraw liquidity from exchanges, which has a positive effect on the price. Secondly, despite the rather strong information noise around Bitcoin, the number of daily new BTC addresses has still not reached the level of 2017. It means that Bitcoin's growth is largely organic, not viral. Third, the boom in open purchases of Bitcoin by institutional investors has pushed the rate up quite strongly, but in addition to large funds, the creation of reserves in Bitcoin by government agencies has begun.

For example, the mayor of Miami said that he could invest part of the city's treasury reserves in Bitcoin, because ""Bitcoin was the most stable investment during an incredibly unstable year.""

It is also worth to note that there is not yet enough pressure from Bitcoin sellers to start a correction of the price. Even when it fell to $27.7 K, from $28 K and up to $30 K Bitcoin was actively bought out, supporting its price.

Only if the price breaks down again to $30 K level, BTC will go to a deeper correction, perhaps even to $24 K, experts say. However, even in this case, it will be a great opportunity to buy Bitcoin for $24 K. There is no reason to sell Bitcoin now. The same is for Ethereum. In the event of a drop the price below $975, the road will open to a deeper correction in the area of $750. But, as in the case of BTC — it will be a great opportunity to buy ETH cheap.

In order for Ethereum to update its historical maximum in the coming days, it needs to rise above the local peak of $1.1 K. This situation is real, because of the growth dynamics in recent days. I expected to see the current price no earlier than in March, perhaps even in April.

Earlier, strategists from JPMorgan have predicted that in the long term, the price of Bitcoin could exceed $146 K. They warned that it is impossible to exclude the possibility of speculative mania, which in the near future may push the price of the first cryptocurrency to $50-100 K. However, such price levels will be unstable.","Bitcoin Price Touches the $37K Zone, Crypto Economy's Market Cap Hits $1 Trillion

The price of bitcoin smashed through the last all-time high again jumping above the $37k zone to $37,400 per coin. The crypto asset’s market valuation is around $689 billion at the time of publication, as it has seen $26 billion in trade volume worldwide. Moreover, the entire crypto-economy surpassed the $1 trillion mark on Wednesday evening (EST) as well.

Bitcoin (BTC) has jumped over the $37k handle on Wednesday surpassing the cryptocurrency’s previous all-time high (ATH). At approximately 7:04 p.m. (EST), BTC touched an ATH of around $37,400 per unit.

Bitcoin is up 8.5% during the last 24 hours, 27% during the last seven days, 91% for the month, and 235% for the 90-day span. BTC is also up more than 350% against the U.S. dollar for the last 12 months.

Despite BTC’s price being so high, the Bitcoin dominance index is a tad lower. The metric shows bitcoin’s market dominance compared to all the other crypto assets in existence is around 68.5%, after riding high above 70% for a while.

The Bitcoin network hashrate has also skyrocketed during the last 24 hours as miners are dedicating 162 exahash per second (EH/s) to the BTC network. There’s approximately 19 mining pools with hashrate pointed at the blockchain and F2pool leads the pack.

The pools that follow F2pool include operations such as Huobi Pro, Binance Pool, Antpool, and Btc.com.

The executive at the Bitcoin Depot, Brandon Mintz, told news.Bitcoin.com that BTC’s scarcity is driving demand. “The scarcity of BTC compared to the printability of dollars is likely to attract savvy individuals looking to diversify their assets in the event of a lapse in the traditional financial system,” Mintz said. “As the adoption rate of BTC increases and the supply remains constant, the value of BTC will only continue to rise.”

Meanwhile, as BTC crossed a new ATH, digital assets like ETH, ADA, BCH, LINK, and XLM have all seen percentage gains between 8% to 70%. Ethereum’s market cap, which is hovering around $138 billion, is partly the reason BTC’s dominance has dropped a few percentages.

Currently, the entire market cap of all 7,500+ crypto assets is approximately $1,000,395,709,742 according to exchange data.

Digital currency bitcoin has emerged as a rival to gold and could trade as high as US$146,000 (C$185,223) if it becomes established as a safe-haven asset, investment bank JPMorgan (JPM) said on Tuesday.

Interest in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency has soared this year, with investors viewing bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to the depreciating dollar. The rush led to bitcoin prices more than tripling in the past six months to a record peak of $34,800 on Jan. 2.

“Bitcoin’s competition with gold has already started in our mind,” the Wall Street bank’s strategists said in a note, citing recent $7 billion outflows from gold and more than $3 billion of inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

That could mark a new dawn for the volatile digital currency after years as a play for speculators and retail punters.

“Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, a crowding out of gold as an ‘alternative’ currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term,” JPM said.

Bitcoin is likely to outshine gold as millennials become a more important component of the investment market over time and given their preference for “digital gold” over traditional bullion, JPM added.

With a market capitalisation of $575 billion, the bitcoin price would need a nearly fivefold jump to $146,000 to match the value of private gold wealth held in gold bars, coins or exchange-traded funds, the bank’s note added.

JPM strategists said the upside is conditional on the volatility of bitcoin converging with that of gold in the longer term.

Though JPM sees the possibility of “current speculative mania” propelling bitcoin to between $50,000 and $100,000, it warned that such levels would prove unsustainable until its volatility levels out.

“We note that the spectacular bitcoin rally of the past few weeks has moved bitcoin into more challenging territory, not only in terms of its positioning backdrop, but also in terms of its valuation,” the bank said.","Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- For investment firms that profit by buying the debt of troubled companies, it looked like the opportunity of a lifetime: a $1 trillion pile of distressed bonds and loans in the Americas alone as the pandemic sent markets into meltdown last March.But after a massive federal bailout and rock-bottom interest rates kept even some of the shakiest companies afloat, those juicy targets have shriveled to less than $100 billion. That’s left distressed-debt specialists -- who at one point last year had $131 billion to spend -- rummaging for increasingly elusive bargains. Even the real estate sector, which was hammered after the pandemic shuttered offices, hotels and stores, has managed for now to avoid an epic wipeout.So, how are distressed-debt investors -- often among of the savviest in the markets -- deploying all that cash? A few, like Caspian Capital, decided to return some money to investors because the rewards wouldn’t justify the high risks anymore.Others are looking farther afield. Olympus Peak Asset Management is dipping into things like unpaid vendor claims in firms that are already bankrupt. Arena Investors is picking through convertible bonds and real estate loans cast off by banks. And giants of the business like Oaktree Capital Management are rustling around in Asia for opportunities.“People aren’t investing, they’re just chasing,” said Adam Cohen, Caspian’s managing partner. And this comes with an extra helping of risk, according to Oaktree co-founder Howard Marks, the dean of distressed investing. “To get to higher returns these days, you have to be willing to extend credit to somebody who is not clearly coming back,” Marks said in a Bloomberg TV interview.The money nevertheless continues to roll in, and managers have made some progress at finding new places to put it. About 40 funds -- from Oaktree to Angelo Gordon & Co. -- collected about $35 billion between this year and last, according to consultants at Preqin.For Arena Investors, a $2.2 billion investment firm, going smaller and nimble has had its advantages, said Chief Executive Officer Dan Zwirn. That’s because 80% of distressed companies in early April had less than $1 billion of debt outstanding, and about 60% of the companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year owed less than $500 million. That’s left too many larger firms chasing the few big situations that are left.“When you’re writing checks above $100 million, the level of competition is excessive,” Zwirn said.Arena deployed almost all of the $519 million it raised for a special opportunities strategy last year, targeting industries dislocated by the pandemic. Among the things they’ve been active in: real estate loans, special-situation lending in energy and aviation and litigation finance.Tighter LendingFund managers like Olympus Peak are also looking at companies that are too small to tap into the seemingly limitless bond and equity markets, which were supercharged last year by the unprecedented wave of federal stimulus.Large public-market borrowers have been mostly picked over by now. Smaller companies, on the other hand, have relied more on banks for liquidity. And the percentage of banks making it tougher to get a loan is still high at 11.4%, according to the Federal Reserve, well above the 1.9% average since the great financial crisis.“If you can only do public-market distress, you just have to hold your position, because if you sell it, there’s nothing else to buy,” said Jason Dillow, chief executive officer at the $8.4 billion Bardin Hill Investment Partners.Biggest Distressed/Special Situations Funds of 2020-2021Either way, distressed fund managers are trying a variety of tactics to drum up returns, according to people familiar with the portfolios:Bardin Hill raised $600 million for privately negotiated credit in early February and deployed about 78% of it. The cash went into high-end cruise lines, fitness, technology, health care and education, along with alternative assets such as insurance-backed claims.Olympus Peak, which runs a $1.4 billion hedge fund, started a $300 million fund this month focused on vendor claims that arise out of bankruptcies. So-called trade claims are often small, illiquid and labor-intensive, and thus less attractive for a larger fund.Angelo Gordon collected $3.5 billion at the beginning of the pandemic and invested all of it, plus $1 billion in recycled capital. It favored privately negotiated financings with high yields and strong protections for its investment written into its agreements.Centerbridge Partners’ Special Credit III strategy invested $1.8 billion in March and April of 2020. It has since traded out of 90% of those positions. The cash was redeployed into growth companies such as HCI Group Inc. and rescue financing for businesses such as cinema chains, including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., its U.K. subsidiary Odeon, and Cineworld Group Plc.As of February, Monarch Alternative Capital had invested more than 60% of the $3 billion it raised last year for its latest distressed credit fund. The firm lent to bankrupt businesses after the pandemic shut them down temporarily. The roster included a franchisee for Wendy’s and Pizza Hut, Ann Taylor’s parent company Ascena Retail Group, and the owner of Chuck E. Cheese, with Monarch looking beyond the pandemic and at times boosting its investment to keep the companies afloat.D.E. Shaw & Co. raised $1 billion for its latest private credit fund that targets stressed assets and financings with a 5-year investment window, the firm said Tuesday.For Cohen’s $3.5 billion Caspian Capital, distressed-debt investing is too narrow a mandate in today’s world, so the firm broadened into firms that are merely stressed. It’s looking for 10% to 15% yields, or credits that trade between 70 and 90 cents on the dollar but aren’t in default.Even with that wider purview, Caspian decided to close its $500 million dislocation strategy fund after cashing out when prices rebounded. Investors got back $565 million.“Money always burns a hole in your pocket,” Cohen said. “The best thing you can do now is not make a mistake. That can save you a lot more money than mediocre trades can make you.”To be sure, firms with patient capital don’t have to invest right away, and there could be a bigger wave of opportunities after policymakers scale back economic support, according to JPMorgan Asset Management’s David Lebovitz.In the meantime, Oaktree is looking to raise $15 billion for its latest distressed fund and put its money to work outside the U.S. So far, public filings show, only about 10% of its pledged capital was drawn as of February. Oaktree’s pitch to investors cited almost $5 trillion in opportunities across Asia, mostly China, including non-performing loans, bonds, shadow-banking loans and leveraged loans.The lingering question is whether the distressed assets that remain are destined for a recovery, or whether they’re simply being kept afloat by an historic dead-cat bounce that won’t last.“If you had a fundamentally strong business, you could’ve found the liquidity to make it through the challenges of 2020,” Chris Acito, chief investment officer of Gapstow Capital Partners, a New York-based firm that specializes in picking credit-fund managers. “Many of the businesses which are still in distress have flawed business models that will be difficult to revive.”(Updates with D.E.

Value investor Bill Miller praised Bitcoin in a market letter on Thursday.

The Miller Value Partners chief and former Legg Mason boss invoked Warren Buffett's scathing criticism of the cryptocurrency to underscore the threat of inflation to those holding dollars.

""Warren Buffett famously called Bitcoin 'rat poison,'"" Miller said. ""He may well be right. Bitcoin could be rat poison, and the rat could be cash.""

Buffett has repeatedly highlighted inflation as a downside to holding cash, and stated that he prefers to own productive assets such as businesses.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Veteran investor Bill Miller trumpeted Bitcoin's rich prospects in a blog post this week, repurposing Warren Buffett's dismissal of the cryptocurrency as ""rat poison"" to underscore his own faith in it.

The Miller Value Partners boss and former Legg Mason investment chief pointed out that Bitcoin has outperformed all major asset classes in recent years. The digital coin currently boasts a bigger market capitalization than Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, even though it's yet to be widely adopted, he continued.

Miller added that the Federal Reserve is threatening to erode the dollar's value with rock-bottom interest rates and continued liquidity injections into the US economy. The pressure on the greenback has spurred the likes of Square and MicroStrategy to shift some of their cash into Bitcoin to lessen the impact of depreciation, he said.

Bitcoin is ""best thought of as digital gold"", yet has several advantages over the haven metal, Miller continued. If more companies swap cash for crypto, ""the current relative trickle into Bitcoin would become a torrent,"" he added.

""Warren Buffett famously called bitcoin 'rat poison,'"" Miller said. ""He may well be right. Bitcoin could be rat poison, and the rat could be cash.""

It's worth noting Buffett has underscored inflation as an inevitable downside of holding currency-denominated assets such as cash or bonds. The Berkshire chief has also criticized ""stores of value"" such as gold, as they don't produce anything and only increase in value if someone is willing to pay more for them in the future.

Instead, Buffett prefers to own productive assets such as farms and businesses.

""Whether the currency a century from now is based on gold, seashells, shark teeth, or a piece of paper (as today), people will be willing to exchange a couple of minutes of their daily labor for a Coca-Cola or some See's peanut brittle,"" he said in his 2011 shareholder letter.","Operating for a year now, insidious malware ElectroRAT is bringing 2020 into 2021 and targeting crypto wallets.

A researcher at cybersecurity firm Intezer has identified and documented the inner workings of ElectroRAT, which has been targeting and draining victims’ funds.

According to the researcher, Avigayil Mechtinger, the malware operation includes a variety of detailed tools that dupes victims, including a “marketing campaign, custom cryptocurrency-related applications and a new Remote Access Tool (RAT) written from scratch.”

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The malware is called ElectroRAT because it’s a remote access tool that was embedded in apps built on Electron, an app-building platform. Hence, ElectroRAT.

“It’s unsurprising to see novel malware being published, especially during a bull market in which the value of cryptocurrency is shooting up and making such attacks more profitable,” said Jameson Lopp, chief technology officer (CTO) at crypto custody startup Casa.

Over the past few months, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have entered a bull market, seeing prices skyrocket across the industry.

What is ElectroRAT?

ElectroRat malware is written in the open-source programming language Golang, which is good for cross-platform functionality and is targeted at multiple operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows.

As part of the malware operation, the attackers set up “domain registrations, websites, trojanized applications and fake social media accounts,” according to the report.

In the report, Mechtinger notes that while attackers commonly try to collect private keys used to access people’s wallets, seeing original tools like ElectroRAT and the various apps written “from scratch” and targeting multiple operating systems is quite rare.

A visual summary of the scope of ElectroRAT (Intezer)

“Writing the malware from scratch has also allowed the campaign to fly under the radar for almost a year by evading all antivirus detections,” wrote Mechtinger in the report.

Lopp echoed these comments, and said it’s particularly interesting the malware is being compiled for and targeting all three major operating systems.

“The value majority of malware tends to be Windows-only due to the wide install base and the weaker security of the operating system,” said Lopp. “In the case of bitcoin, malware authors may reason that a lot of early adopters are more technical people who run Linux.”

How it works

To lure in victims, the ElectroRat attackers created three different domains and apps operating on multiple operating systems.

The pages to download the apps were created specifically for this operation and designed to look like legitimate entities.

The associated apps specifically appeal to and target cryptocurrency users. “Jamm” and “eTrade” are trade management apps; “DaoPoker” is a poker app that uses cryptocurrency.

Using fake social media and user profiles, as well as paying a social media influencer for their advertising, the attacker pumped the apps, including promoting them in targeted cryptocurrency and blockchain forums like bitcointalk and SteemCoinPan. The posts encouraged readers to look at the professional-looking websites and download the apps when, in reality, they were also downloading the malware.

The front end of the eTrade app (Intezer)

For example, the DaoPoker Twitter page had 417 followers while a social media advertiser with over 25,000 followers on Twitter promoted eTrade. As of writing, the DaoPoker twitter page is still live.

While the apps look legitimate at first glance on the front end, they are running nefarious background activities, targeting users’ cryptocurrency wallets. They are also still active.

“Hackers want to get your cryptocurrency, and they are willing to go far with it – spend months of work to create fake companies, fake reputation and innocent-looking applications that hide malware to steal your coins,” said Mechtinger.

What it does

“ElectroRAT has various capabilities,” said Mechtinger in an email. “It can take screenshots, key logs, upload folders/files from a victim’s machine and more. Upon execution, it establishes commands with its command-and control-server and waits for commands.”

The report suggests the malware specifically targets cryptocurrency users for the purpose of attacking their crypto wallets, noting that victims were observed commenting on posts related to the popular Ethereum wallet app Metamask. Based on the researchers’ observations of the malware’s behaviors, it’s possible more than 6.5 thousand people had been compromised.

How to avoid it

The first step is the best step and that’s not to download any of these apps, full stop.

In general, when you’re looking into new apps, Lopp suggests avoiding shady websites and forums. Only install software that is well-known and properly reviewed; look for apps with lengthy reputation histories and sizable install bases.

“Don’t use wallets that store the private keys on your laptop/desktop; private keys should be stored on dedicated hardware devices,” said Lopp.

This point reinforces the importance of storing your crypto in cold hardware wallets and writing down seed phrases rather than just storing them on your computer. Both of these techniques make them inaccessible to malware that trolls your online activity.

There are secondary steps that can be taken if you think your computer might have already been compromised.

“To make sure you are not infected we recommend [you] take proactive action and scan your devices for malicious activity,” said Mechtinger.

In the report, Mechtinger suggests that if you think you’re a victim of this scam, you need to kill the processes running and delete all files related to the malware. You also need to make sure your machine is clean and running non-malicious code. Intezer has created Endpoint Scanner for Windows environments and Intezer Protect, a free community tool for Linux users. More detailed information about detection can be found in the original report.

And, of course, you should move your funds to a new crypto wallet and change all your passwords.

A higher bitcoin price attracts more malware

With the price of bitcoin continuing to rise, Mechtinger doesn’t see attacks like this slowing down. In fact, they’re likely to increase.

“There are high capitals at stake, which is classic for financially motivated hackers,” she said.

Lopp said we will see attackers devote greater and greater resources to coming up with new ways to part people from their private keys.","What’s Hot in Crypto this week?

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency created through a hard fork of the bitcoin network, which occurred in August 2017. Those who supported larger blocks on the network split from BTC to increase the block size from 1 MB to 8 MB on Bitcoin Cash.

Why is BCH hot now?

An increasing number of users are buying Bitcoin Cash, because the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed these past few months. Indeed, despite the split from Bitcoin, the rise and fall of BCH always closely mirrors it. The sudden spike in user activity has been no exception.

Both BTC and BCH quickly gained momentum in mid-October 2020. After Bitcoin hit its all-time high above $34,000 over the weekend, price speculation on the Bitcoin Cash network seemed to rise.

How has BCH’s score changed?

BCH's Fundamental Crypto Asset Score went up 10-points (1.3%), driven by a 19-point (2.13%) rise in User Activity.

This brought Bitcoin Cash back as a member of the ""FCAS 25."" These are reevaluated each month and must be ranked within the Top 25 for at least 40 days to qualify. The FCAS is a comparative metric that evaluates the fundamental health of a crypto project, and the FCAS 25 is a weighted moving average of the top 25 projects that aims to show the overall health of the crypto industry.

What’s Flipside’s Take?

It’s worth noting the risk of investing in BCH remains high because no one is really using the token for anything other than speculation, and its price could drop at any moment. The submetric “project utilization” of BCH, which goes into measuring an asset’s user activity, remains alarmingly low. At the same time, “Risk,” which measures the volatility of an asset also ranks very poorly, which comes at no surprise considering the highly unstable price history of Bitcoin Cash.

A third of that amount is in ether, roughly more than 300,000 ETH, according to a spokesperson from the San Francisco-based crypto exchange. Other popular cryptocurrencies on Kraken’s staking services include tezos (XTZ) and polkadot (DOT).

Kraken’s users have staked about 58 million DOT (approximately $580,000,000) and 45.5 million XTZ tokens (about $22,500,000), according to data provided by Kraken.

The fast growth of the staking value reflects the many long positions of investors and traders in cryptocurrencies, according to Jeremy Welch, Kraken’s vice president of product.

“Staking’s popularity is the natural outcome of an asset class growing in maturity,” Welch told CoinDesk. “Whereas three years ago holders were mainly interested in securing short-term gains, many are now confident locking up tokens to earn passive income. Why? Conviction is growing in the longevity of crypto assets as a respectable new asset class.”

Kraken also provides staking services for five other cryptocurrencies, including kava (KAVA) and cosmos (ATOM), with yearly rewards varying between 0.25% and 20%.

“Staking” refers to locking up one’s cryptocurrencies to receive rewards for participating in transaction validation on a proof-of-stake blockchain. Many crypto exchanges offer staking services so users do not have to stake their coins directly from their wallets.

Kraken started providing the Ethereum 2.0 staking service on Dec. 3. It warned its users in a blog post at the time that staking is mostly for “long-term ether holders” because “staking ether cannot be unstaked and, along with staking rewards, cannot be transferred for an unknown period of time.”

The total amount of ether locked in Ethereum 2.0 has recently surpassed $2.58 billion, less than a month since ether’s value broke the $1 billion landmark, according to data from Etherscan. As of press time, ether was trading at $1,145.22, a gain of 8.55% in 24 hours. It is close to its all-time high at $1,448.18, according to CoinDesk 20 data."

The price of bitcoin surged as much as 12% on Thursday, to a record high of $40,394.87.

That helped push the overall value of the cryptocurrency market topped above $1 trillion for the first time ever.

Rival token Ethereum hit its highest in two years, above $1,200, while smaller altcoins including XRP also shot up.

The price of bitcoin surged as much as 12% on Thursday, to a record high of $40,394.87. That helped push the overall value of the cryptocurrency market topped above $1 trillion for the first time ever.

Bitcoin, which has risen by nearly 400% in the last 12 months, has seen immense investor interest in recent weeks.

The driving forces behind the rally are a desire among investors to seek an alternative asset that is decentralized and not tied to any central bank, whose actions can debase a traditional currency's value, as has been the case of the US dollar with the Federal Reserve's zero-interest rate policy and trillions of dollars in stimulus over the last year.

""With buying interest continuing to drive the market, any sell-offs of set-backs will be seen as another opportunity to enter a market that, at the moment, is pushing relentlessly higher,"" DailyFX strategist Nick Cawley said.

""As always with the crypto space, care should be taken, especially with volatility at its current extreme level,"" he added.

With a market cap above $1 trillion, cryptocurrencies are now worth almost half as much as Apple, the world's most valuable company. They're are also more valuable than the entire Swiss economy - home to some of the world's largest financial institutions and biggest gold vaults.

""Bitcoin has continued to rip up trees, metaphorically speaking, rising to a new record,"" CMC Markets chief strategist Michael Hewson said in a daily note.

Greater transparency brought on by regulation and growing market depth have helped cryptocurrencies shed some of their former reputation as an asset class that was rife with speculation, questionable market practices and fraud.

Big-name investors such as Paul Tudor Jones, Mike Novogratz, Anthony Scaramucci have thrown their weight behind Bitcoin and even crypto-skeptic Ray Dalio said called it ""interesting"". Payment companies like PayPal and Square allow their users to trade cryptocurrencies and a growing number of fintechs beyond the US are seeing growing interest from their customer base.

JPMorgan said on Monday Bitcoin could eventually trade as high as $146,000 if investors adopt it as an alternative safe haven to gold, although it did add that such a rally might not be sustainable.

Bitcoin is already the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and the most widely used, with a current value of almost $700 billion. Next up, is Ethereum, which has gained 800% in value in the last year to a two-year high of $1,228 on Thursday on the Coinbase platform. Its market cap is around $138 billion.

Ripple Labs' XRP has had more mixed fortunes recently. US regulators recently issued a complaint against Ripple on the grounds that sales of its XRP token were not legitimate, as it considered the coin a security and not a cryptocurrency.

Having more than doubled in value in just one week in late November, XRP lost almost half its value a month later. Since the start of the month, the token has since doubled in value again. XRP was last up nearly 30% on the day at around $0.328 on the Bitstamp exchange.

Smaller tokens, known as alt-coins, have ridden the coattails of Bitcoin and Ethereum's rally in the last year. Litecoin and Cardano, and so-called stablecoins - those backed by traditional currencies - such as Tether have also seen their worth soar.

The world’s biggest digital coin briefly climbed past the $40,000 mark to a peak of $40,324.01 Thursday afternoon, a more than 14 percent gain from a day earlier, CoinDesk data show.

The jump helped drive the combined market value of all cryptocurrencies up about 9 percent to $1.05 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.com, which tracks hundreds of digital tokens.

Bitcoin alone accounts for the vast majority of that total with a market capitalization of about $723 billion, the site says. It was recently trading at $37,851.27.

Smaller coins also saw gains Thursday — Etherium, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was recently up about 2 percent at $1,217.45, while XRP surged more than 20 percent to about 30 cents, according to CoinDesk.

Once a fascination of amateur retail traders, Bitcoin has been on a record-breaking tear in recent months as it gained traction among institutional investors, roughly doubling its value in less than a month.

The cryptocurrency has been buoyed by perceptions that it’s a good way to protect against inflation. JPMorgan Chase analysts have said Bitcoin could even become an alternative to gold — which could eventually drive its price up to $146,000.

There are also hopes that Bitcoin will become a more widely used payment method, with mainstream digital payments firms such as PayPal and Square allowing Bitcoin on their platforms.

Square bought $50 million worth of Bitcoin in October, and CEO Jack Dorsey — who also leads Twitter — published an open letter this week slamming a federal proposal that would force the company to more carefully track cryptocurrency transactions.","If the 2020 Q1 was the quarter of market turmoil, Q2 the bitcoin halving and Q3 the explosion of stablecoins and decentralized finance applications, Q4 was the quarter of institutional FOMO for bitcoin and of Ethereum launching the first phase of its ambitious migration to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.

The latest CoinDesk Quarterly Review looks at the data and timelines behind these two strong narratives, and what they mean for asset prices.

Bitcoin goes institutional

While the 2017 bitcoin rally was largely driven by retail frenzy, the 2020 rally was driven mainly by institutions. The accelerating rhythm of large institutional investors publicly talking about and investing in bitcoin as a portfolio asset has not only lent validation to bitcoin’s role in portfolios, it has also attracted the attention of other investors. This self-reinforcing loop is likely to continue into 2021, especially given the mounting uncertainty around currencies and inflation.

Bitcoin’s strong rally in the last few days of December crowned an already strong year and produced an annual performance of 300%, way ahead of most macro assets, although behind ETH’s spectacular 470%.

One metric that hints at growing institutional involvement is the number of addresses that hold large balances. The number of addresses with over 1000 BTC, known as “whales,” is over 30% higher than at the end of 2017, the height of the last crypto bull run, indicating the growing presence of deeper pockets in the market.

Another indicator that institutional involvement in the bitcoin markets is growing is the volumes on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), an institution-focused derivatives exchange that offers bitcoin futures and options. The CME’s bitcoin futures open interest in U.S. dollars grew almost 300% over the quarter to become the largest in the industry (as of Dec. 30), having started the quarter in fifth position.

Ethereum spreads its wings

The Ethereum ecosystem saw strong progress in market infrastructure growth in the fourth quarter, and the long-awaited launch on Dec. 1 of Ethereum 2.0 was a major step on the way to migrating the ecosystem to a proof-of-stake blockchain.

Source: CoinDesk Research

Now that launch is successfully out of the way and Ethereum 2.0 developers are focusing their efforts on the task of onboarding several tens of thousands more validators onto the network. The goal is to have a minimum number of 262,144 validators securing Eth 2.0 before advancing to the next phase of development, phase 1. As of Wednesday, Jan. 6, 20% of this number have been onboarded.

Historically, peaks in the number of active accounts on Ethereum have coincided with market tops, but the latest price surge that tipped ETH past $1,100 for the first time since January 2018 was not mirrored by a surge in the number of active accounts. The number of active accounts has been trending upwards but is still roughly 33% lower than its peak of 714,225 reached back in 2018, when ETH price was nearing $1,400. This indicates the latest ETH price bull run may be fueled more by market speculation and less by a growth in real user activity and adoption.

Not all Ethereum transactions involve transfers of ETH. They could involve transfers of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are crypto assets created for unique applications and use cases on top of Ethereum. What’s more, not all Ethereum transactions are initiated by users. Some are initiated automatically by a smart contract, which is the code dictating the functionality behind all decentralized applications (dapps). This year, the total amount of ETH transferred by smart contracts as opposed to users doubled from its previous all-time high reached in 2016. This is a bullish indicator of Ethereum’s growing use case as a dapp platform rather than as a network for transfers of value.

The digital coin hit an all-time high of $40,367 at around 1:17 p.m. ET, just a few hours after blowing past the $39,000 level, according to data from Coin Metrics.

Bitcoin pared some of its gains after hitting a record, last trading at $38,885, up 9.1% higher from a day earlier. The cryptocurrency is up over 30% since the start of 2021 and in the past 12 months has surged 400%.

Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya thinks the digital currency has a long runway ahead even after its massive rally.

""It's probably going to $100,000, then $150,000, then $200,000,"" Palihapitiya told CNBC's ""Halftime Report."" ""In what period? I don't know. [Maybe] five or 10 years, but it's going there.""

""The reason [it's going there] is because, every time you see all of this stuff happening, it reminds you that our leaders are not as trustworthy and reliable as they used to be,"" he said. ""So, just in case, we really do need to have some insurance we can keep under our pillow that gives us some access to an uncorrelated hedge.""

The value of the entire cryptocurrency market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins like ether and tether, surpassed $1 trillion for the first time earlier on Thursday, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Bitcoin is by far the most dominant cryptocurrency, with a market value of over $700 billion.

Bitcoin's resurgence has been attributed to a number of factors including more buying from large institutional investors. High-profile investors like Paul Tudor Jones, for example, have been buying the digital currency.","Cryptocurrencies passed the trillion-dollar mark for the first time yesterday, thanks to Bitcoin’s blistering run.

Coinmarketcap.com showed the crypto market’s total valuation climbing into 13 digits at about at 5:25 p.m. ET. That’s up about 31 percent since the end of 2020. Bitcoin accounted for almost two-thirds of the increase.

The leap compares with a fractional decline in the S&P 500 so far this year. It also pushes the crypto market into small club with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which are also worth more than $1 trillion. Still, cryptos remain about one-tenth the size of the $10 trillion gold market.

Bitcoin’s valuation stood at $695 billion last night. That makes it comparable with Tesla (TSLA).

Institutional Adoption for Bitcoin

The rally follows a steady drum beat of institutional adoption as mainstream firms build positions. Bill Miller was the latest to jump on the bandwagon this week. The legendary value investor declared in his quarterly letter that if “more companies decide to diversify some small portion of their cash balances into bitcoin instead of cash, then the current relative trickle into bitcoin would become a torrent.”

There have also been two other headlines telling a similar story:

Coindesk reported on Monday that over 37,000 Bitcoins were into cold wallets at the start of 2021, a potential sign of institutions amassing large positions.

Cointelegraph reported on Tuesday that retail investors, especially in Asia, are not driving the current rally in Bitcoin (unlike in 2017). This time it’s mostly dollar-based institutions, according to the report.

There’s one last difference this time around versus before: the U.S. dollar.

Bitcoin launched in January 2009, around the same time the greenback bottomed. That means the entire rally of 2011-2018 happened against the backdrop of a strong dollar. But now the dollar is crumbling, which could make Bitcoin even more attractive as a store of value.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways The total market cap of the cryptocurrency industry has hit $1 trillion for the first time.

Bitcoin and Ethereum still dominate, accounting for over 80% of the market value.

Cryptocurrencies are now on a par with the giants of Big Tech in market cap terms.

The cryptocurrency industry is now valued at over $1 trillion. Bitcoin and Ethereum hold roughly 80% of the market cap dominance.

Crypto Market Cap Hits 12 Figures

The cryptocurrency space has hit a value of $1 trillion. It’s the first time the milestone has ever been reached.

The industry’s total market cap crossed 12 figures after a 9.5% price rise, according to CoinGecko. The valuation is $1,024,489,603,730 at the time of writing.

Of the $1 trillion value, two blockchains account for the vast majority: Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The original cryptocurrency, which is still the most popular project in the space, currently holds 67.75% of the market cap dominance. Bitcoin has been registering new record highs regularly since breaking $20,000 on Dec. 16.

Earlier today, it was trading at a high of $37,809.

Ethereum has also been a point of discussion for those watching the space closely—yesterday, it hit $1,200 for the first time in three years after a parabolic run in the days prior. It’s now only 18% short of its all-time high price, recorded in January 2018.

Beyond the two best-known cryptocurrencies, other prominent coins have been making notable gains over the last few days. Stellar (XLM) has seen a 168% price increase in the last week.

Essential DeFi projects Maker (MKR) and Synthetix (SNX) have risen 86.9% and 67%, respectively. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE), a coin often described as a meme that’s become an ironic favorite of Elon Musk, is up 115.6%.

At $1 trillion, the cryptocurrency space’s total market cap is on par with some of the world’s largest companies. There are currently four U.S. companies worth over $1 trillion today—Big Tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.

As is often the case in a cryptocurrency bull market, there’ll undoubtedly be questions over whether such a valuation is sustainable. During the 2017 bull run, Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin posted a now-famous tweetstorm suggesting that he was uneasy with the rising value of cryptocurrencies when the total market cap hit $0.5 trillion.

“How many unbanked people have we banked,” he asked.

So total cryptocoin market cap just hit $0.5T today. But have we *earned* it? — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 13, 2017

But with the likes of JPMorgan calling for a six-digit Bitcoin amid ongoing institutional interest, a multi-trillion dollar market cap could soon be on the horizon.

Investors have flocked to bitcoin in recent months as the cryptocurrency has gone mainstream.

MicroStrategy MSTR BlackRock BLK Software firmis now holding bitcoin on its balance sheet. And a top exec at, the world's largest asset manager, recently said bitcoin is basically a new, digital gold -- an asset that can hold up well during times of dollar weakness and rising inflation.

""It's not surprising to see bitcoin's recent run up. It's encouraging to see more serious consideration of bitcoin and the digital currency asset class broadly, because it has real potential to reshape global finance as we know it,"" said Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale Investments, the world's biggest crypto asset manager, in an email to CNN Business.

The bitcoin boom has gone into overdrive this week, with prices soaring nearly 25% in just the past five days, pushing the cryptocurency past multiple milestone levels.

That is raising alarm bells even among some bitcoin bulls.

""Market players are adopting bitcoin to hedge against instability. But while further growth is inevitable, investors should not expect this to move in a straight line,"" said Gavin Smith, CEO of Panxora Group, a cryptocurrency consortium, in an email to CNN Business.

Smith added that bitcoin prices could crash by 25% at times and that the cryptocurrency should not be viewed as a ""magic money tree.""

Bitcoin prices could plunge even further than 25%, warns Alex Mashinsky, CEO and founder of Celsius Network, a crypto asset manager.

""Sooner or later, the bears will accumulate enough pressure to see a correction,"" Mashinsky said in an email to CNN Business, adding that bitcoin prices could fall all the way back to $16,000 before the end of the first quarter.

""This will flush the weak hands and transfer the baton with all their BTC from the short term speculators to the long term institutions and HODLers,"" he added.","Disclosure

But while all eyes were on the intruders in the Senate Chamber, another seismic event was taking place on the financial markets as cryptocurrencies’ combined value hit $1 trillion for the first time.

Jack Purdy, an analyst at Messari, attempted to put the price in context when he tweeted:

It took Apple 42 years to hit $1 trillion and another 2 years to hit $2 trillion.



Crypto hit $1 trillion in 1/4 the time



Wouldn’t be surprised if the same held true for the second 😉 — Jack Purdy (@jpurd17) January 7, 2021

It is worth trying to get a handle on the figures because they are jaw-dropping. According to crypto tracker CoinGecko, the market capitalisation of all cryptocurrency was $208 billion on the 7th January 2020. It has risen five fold in the last 12 months to a new high of $1.04 trillion. Its previous high was early January 2018 when it hovered around $850 billion before crashing by almost two thirds in one month.

The latest record valuation comes on the back of the soaring value of Bitcoin. In one year, the globe’s most valuable cryptocurrency has increased by just under 400% and is currently trading at around $38,000. Bitcoin’s recent rise has been staggering. It surged 11% in the last 24 hours alone and 65% in the last 14 days. With a market capitalisation of $714 billion, Bitcoin is only a couple of billion away from the valuation of Tesla and is just outside the top ten assets ranked by market capitalisation.

It is not the only cryptocurrency to have shone brightly of late. Ethereum, the second most valuable crypto, is up 62% in the last week and now sells at $1227. That price gives Ether a market capitalisation of $140 billion. Together with Bitcoin, the two digital assets are worth more than 4/5 of all cryptocurrencies’ value. Tether, XRP and LiteCoin complete the top five.

At the time of writing (15:00, 7th Jan 21), the screens are flashing green for almost every cryptocurrency as the soaring values of Bitcoin and Ether rub off on their competitors. Dozens have seen double digit rises in mere days.

Further upside?

Will there be a correction? We cannot tell the future. However, it certainly would not be the first correction; as many retail investors who bought in late 2017 would unhappily attest. Crypto’s reputation for volatility could not be called unfair by even its biggest fans.

All the same, if current valuations seem frothy to some, they seem hugely undervalued to others. Qiao Wang is co-founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) accelerator firm DeFi Alliance and former quantitative trader at Tower Research. In an interview with CoinDesk, he said, ‘Cryptocurrencies are now almost an institutional-grade venture bet. The market is finally liquid enough to deploy large sums of capital, but still early enough for a 10x return.’

JP Morgan Chase & Co. thought that Bitcoin’s long term value could reach $146,000. Citibank have cited $300, 000. While making several bearish counter arguments, Nick Maggiulli, chief operating officer at Ritholtz Wealth Management, recently went further still and wondered if Bitcoin could rise to $500,000 a coin. Sticking his neck out, or going for broke – choose whichever metaphor you like -Cory Klippsten, the chief executive of Bitcoin-buying app Swan Bitcoin, thinks that $1 million is feasible in the next ten years.

Renegade turns respectable

What is for certain is that there has been a sea change in sentiment around cryptocurrency. Against a backdrop of central banks printing money to offset the financial havoc of Covid 19, many institutional investors have come round to the idea that cryptocurrencies are a possible way of moving value beyond the reach of state policy. Companies such as PayPal, Square and Revolut have adopted crypto while the conservative insurance giant MassMutual recently purchased $100 million-worth of Bitcoin.

Put another way, crypto is losing its former renegade status and becoming respectable and trusted. In an essay for The Conversation, Iwa Salami, Senior Lecturer in Financial Law and Regulation, University of East London, eloquently noted that ‘at least as far as centralised exchanges are concerned, the days of cryptocurrencies ruled by romantic buccaneers and pirates are slowly coming to an end’.

Earlier this week, the Association of Investment Companies quoted Kiran Raja, principal disruptive tech analyst at GlobalData:

‘Unlike Bitcoin’s previous surge in 2017, which was driven by the hype among retail investors, the latest increase is a result of institutional investors, public companies, major banks and payment companies turning their investment focus to digital assets like cryptocurrency.’

Last November, Ruffer Investment Company announced that they had taken some profits from gold and initiated a £550 million position in Bitcoin. At the time, they explained:

‘We see this as a small but potent insurance policy against the continuing devaluation of the world’s major currencies. Bitcoin diversifies the company’s (much larger) investments in gold and inflation-linked bonds, and acts as a hedge to some of the monetary and market risks that we see.

‘Negative interest rates, extreme monetary policy, ballooning public debt, dissatisfaction with governments – all provide powerful tailwinds for Bitcoin at a time when conventional safe-haven assets, particularly government bonds, are perilously expensive.’

Depending on your perspective, £550 million may or may not be small but, as insurance policies go, there is no arguing with how potent it has been for Ruffer to date. Some have speculated that the fund managers have bagged paper profits of up to £690 million. Good going for an investment made around two months ago.

Restricted supply drives demand

Another factor driving crypto gains is that the number of sellers is low at the moment and this restricted supply is increasing demand. According to trader chatter on various blogs, the only sellers around seem to be investors from East Asia who are selling to investors in the West.

This seems to be an acceleration of an earlier trend. Block chain analysis company, Chainalysis released their 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report last August. Drawing on data from July 2019 to June 2020, it mooted that East Asia ‘is arguably the linchpin of the global cryptocurrency market. With 78% higher trading volume than the next closest region, it has liquidity to spare and sends more cryptocurrency around the globe than any other region’. Comparatively early adopters of crypto, East Asian investors appear to be slowly top slicing from their massive gains into the eager hands of investors further west.

While noting that in March 2020, North America overtook East Asia for the second time in the last 12 months as ‘the region where professional investors dominate most’, the report also underlined the increased interest in crypto from well established financial names:

‘North America also hosts a growing class of institutional investors moving even larger transfers of cryptocurrency than those we typically see from professional traders. The institutional share of the market has grown over the past few years, which can be seen by many to legitimize cryptocurrency as an asset class.’

The cryptocurrency story has been a wild one so far and there will certainly be other twists and turns in the tale. The $1 trillion market capitalisation will not be the final chapter but it will be a significant one in which crypto displays a maturity which many thought beyond it. As many institutional investors begin to look at crypto more fondly, we will give the final word to Ruffer, who, in their portfolio update, wryly pointed out that Bitcoin ‘seems set to move from being loved by the anti-establishment to being embraced by the dominant interests of the establishment’.","Proponents of digital currencies are exuberant about the potential for 2021 after a monster year that saw highflying Bitcoin prices grab control of the spotlight. That's nothing new – but the much wider feeling across Wall Street that ""this time it's different"" is. Bitcoin prices recovered from a multiyear slump in 2020. It breached its 2017 record near $20,000 in November, and it has gone parabolic ever since, sitting well above $40,000 as of this publication. What might actually make this time different, however, isn't that Bitcoin prices hit new highs in 2020 and finished the year with a head of steam. It's that the cryptocurrency succeeded in its first trial by fire. The resilience of that digital coin and others – and the reasons behind it – have many excited not just about the prospects for this young asset class in 2021, but also for the overall adoption of this burgeoning financial technology. What Is Bitcoin? First, a quick refresher for the uninitiated: Bitcoin is one of many digital currencies. Unlike traditional ""fiat"" currencies created and operated by a government and central bank, Bitcoin is ""mined,"" or created by people who solve mathematical problems with computing power. Transactions are kept on the blockchain, an encrypted and decentralized ledger that protects the integrity of Bitcoin while also ensuring the privacy of the user.

And in contrast to fiat currencies, which can be printed on demand, Bitcoin is limited to a total of 21 million possible coins once it is fully mined. (Fortunately, it can be divided fractionally down to 1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin, known as a ""Satoshi."") It was designed to be a true store of value that couldn't be manipulated. Indeed, Bitcoin was invented in 2008 and launched in 2009, just as world governments were printing money to respond to the global financial crisis. A slew of other digital assets followed. ""One of the things that fascinates me with how Bitcoin has come into existence is that it came in upside-down,"" says Greg King, CEO of Osprey Funds, which operates the Osprey Bitcoin Trust. ""It came in through individual acceptance, a grassroots type of thing."" Bitcoin More Than Survives 2020 Bitcoin prices crashed after sharp rallies in 2013 and 2017, but these declines weren't precipitated by any major event spanning multiple asset classes. The digital coin was merely cut by the other edge of speculation's blade; worries about hacking risks, for instance, hampered cryptocurrencies in 2018. So the bear market of 2020, brief as it was, marked the first time Bitcoin and other digital currencies faced a truly global crisis that threatened numerous types of investments. Cryptocurrencies were hardly immune from the bear turn. Investors first started selling off equities in February as they moved to cash, and even safety plays such as gold eventually took a dip in March. But Bitcoin eventually fell, too, crashing hard in mid-March.

Those lows were short-lived, however. Digital currencies bounced hardest off the bottom, and Bitcoin turned positive by April. It then took flight through the end of 2020. ""What we needed to see was Bitcoin survive a global macro meltdown,"" says Tyrone Ross, CEO of Onramp Invest, a digital platform allowing financial advisors to provide clients with access to cryptocurrencies. ""If you look at when it was invented until March, it had never experienced a recessionary environment."" ""It correlated with the market and came down with everything else. There was a flight to dollars. (But) if you look at how it behaved since then, folks see that there's something here. The actual activity on the blockchain was impressive."" How Bitcoin Interest is Growing A push to liquidity, such as the one seen in March, is rare, and it usually occurs at the climax of a market selloff. The fact that it also happened in Bitcoin around the same time hints that more institutional interest was in play than in previous crashes. And growing institutional interest is one of several trends that King expects to be a major driver in Bitcoin prices over the years to come. Coinbase, a digital currency exchange that's expected to go public this year, said on Nov. 21 that its institutional asset base from $6 billion in April 2020 to $20 billion as of mid-November. And Canaccord Genuity recently pointed out a laundry list of recent institutional and other noteworthy cryptocurrency events. Here are just a few highlights from the last quarter of 2020:

Oct. 27: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) sends its ""JPM Coin"" digital currency live and forms an Onyx division to focus on the blockchain.

Billionaire and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio says Bitcoin has a place in investors' portfolios. Dec. 12: Insurance firm MassMutual purchases $100 million in Bitcoin. That's just a sliver of the announcements from Q4, which also included moves from a number of nations advancing digital currency or blockchain initiatives, including the U.S., Canada, Japan, England, South Korea, China and Russia. King adds that individual interest is being driven higher as platforms such as Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL) are making digital currencies such as Bitcoin more accessible to people. And in October, Coinbase launched a cryptocurrency debit card under the Visa (V) banner. Then there's inflation. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are drawing comparisons to gold, as they're a relatively fixed asset at a time when fiat money printing is growing out of control. Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, a relative newcomer to the space, told CNBC that the cryptocurrency market is ""still in the first inning"" and that he sees Bitcoin as a better inflation play than Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and gold. BCA Research strategists see a similar advantage, saying that ""in addition to benefitting from ample global liquidity and the cyclical US dollar bear market, Bitcoin will be an attractive hedge against rising inflation in the second half of the decade.""

Time will tell whether that's the case. Inflation fears after the financial crisis led to a spike in gold prices in 2011, but when higher rates of inflation failed to materialize, investors exited the gold trade quickly. Nevertheless, the metal, like its digital counterpart, did make new highs in 2020 around $2,070 per ounce; unlike Bitcoin prices, gold has pulled back considerably, now sitting around $1,850. King says there's another interesting twist to the cryptocurrency narrative this time around. ""One thing I've found interesting versus 2016 and 2017 is nobody's asking about Bitcoin and nefarious activities,"" he says. ""I haven't gotten a single question on that. Obviously, all types of currencies are used for illegal activities. That question seems to have disappeared. To me, that's an indicator of growing acceptance and understanding."" It's possible cryptocurrency is following the playbook laid out in 1914 by union leader Nicholas Klein: ""First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you."" 2021: Another Massive Year for Bitcoin Prices? Bitcoin is attracting a growing number of analysts, and as a result, Bitcoin price targets are becoming more commonplace. Some have been downright bombastic. Former Adaptive Capital partner Willy Woo calls $200,000 a ""conservative"" estimate for year-end 2021. In mid-November, Citigroup told its institutional clients that it sees the potential for Bitcoin prices to rise as high as $318,000 by the end of this year. Others are more restrained. For instance, BTIG's Julian Emanuel says Bitcoin could reach $50,000 – the same price target Bloomberg pointed to in its Crypto Outlook 2021.

Ross, without making a specific prediction, sees the cryptocurrency space further growing in value to the global financial system: ""I think in 2021 we'll see a lot of news that will move the price higher,"" he says. ""We'll get closer to an ETF, announcements from broker-dealers that they're getting involved. Some more FOMO (fear of missing out) from retail investors, and what you'll also see is that at some point you'll see a massive RIA announce that they have a meaningful amount of their business in BTC."" ""One of the things we do believe is that there's a secular trend into Bitcoin,"" adds King, who's also reticent to throw out a price target. ""We're in an S-curve type of growth with an emerging technology. If you look at the previous patterns of prices versus adoption, it tends to consolidate and then have a multiple move higher. This is starting to look pretty decisively higher."" This combination of increased investment interest in Bitcoin as an investment, as well as increased adaptation of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies by companies, points to a perfect storm for prices. But Ross adds a word of caution. ""You always have risk,"" he says. ""Systemic risk, market risk … There are some global macro events that can affect markets, and as Bitcoin becomes more financialized, it won't become that noncorrelated asset anymore."" The Regulatory Wild Card One of the biggest risks to any bullish calls, sky-high or not, is the potential for regulatory agencies to suddenly erect a brick wall.

While fewer people might be asking about using Bitcoin to buy illicit substances anymore, regulators are again taking a close look at digital currencies, this time with a focus on how these coins act as securities. The most noteworthy of late: In late December, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filed a lawsuit against the ""altcoin"" Ripple. (Altcoins are any digital coin that's an alternative to Bitcoin.) The issue at question is whether its digital currency is really a digital currency, or if it's an unregistered securities offering. The news was enough to cut Ripple prices by more than half in just a few days, and several cryptocurrency exchanges stopped trading in the altcoin until the issue is resolved. Even then, some Bitcoin bulls see a silver lining. Ripple has a different mechanism relative to Bitcoin's decentralized model, so some believe a crackdown on altcoins points to Bitcoin as the first (and maybe only) stop for people interested in cryptocurrencies. How to Invest in Bitcoin While Bitcoin prices might be sitting above $40,000 right now, you can still enter it (and most other cryptocurrencies) for literally just a few bucks by purchasing fractions of coins. But no investor should spend a cent without brushing up on what is still a very nascent technology and asset class. ""The best investment that any investment that any individual can make is learning as much as they can,"" Ross says. ""That truly is the best way."" To that end, sites such as Coinbase and Binance Academy offer rudimentary basics to get people up to speed.","Bitcoin is stable above $38,000 to allow bulls to regroup for another run-up to price levels past $40,000.

Ethereum is having an uphill battle to sustain the uptrend above $1,200.

Ripple is trading between the 200 SMA resistance and the 100 SMA on the 4-hour chart.

The cryptocurrency market has slowed down the drastic upward movements apart from Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time at $40,425. However, some selected altcoins continue to tower the crypto horizon with their massive gains. For instance, Enjin Coin is up 60% over the last 24 hours; Nano spiked 30% while Civic is up a whopping 56%.

Bitcoin seeks stability after rejection from new all-time high

The bellwether cryptocurrency exchanged hands above $40,000 for the first time in its history. However, due to the extremely volatile market, BTC retreated considerably, revisiting levels slightly above $36,600.

As expected, Bitcoin did not stay down for long. Recovery occurred, stepping above $38,000. At the time of writing, BTC/USD is trading at $38,677 amid a struggle to complete the leg above $40,000. For now, stability seems critical to ensure that declines are avoided while the focus is kept on levels beyond $40,000.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart

Bitcoin must close the day above two key levels; the ascending channel’s lower boundary and $38,000. However, if it fails, declines are likely to come into the picture, pulling the price back to the recent support at $36,600. Other key support levels to keep in mind include $36,000, $34,000, and $30,000.

Ethereum fights to keep the uptrend intact

The pioneer altcoin has been on an upward roll since mid-December to the extent of trading the latest new yearly high at $1,294. However, a minor breakdown occurred from the rising wedge pattern as predicted on Thursday.

Support at $1,200 and $1,100 was shattered, stopping the predicted slide to $900. Meanwhile, recovery is underway, with bulls persistent on reclaiming the position above $1,200. Stability above this crucial level is expected to increase investors’ confidence in the recovery and ETH’s ability to rise to the early 2018 highs above $1,400.

ETH/USD 4-hour chart

Recovery and stability will be a pipe dream if Ether fails to close the day above $1,200. In case bears slice through the next support target at $1,100, we can anticipate another leg down to $1,000 or even $900.

Ripple technicals bring two key levels to test

Ripple almost hit $0.4 after the breakout discussed on Thursday. On the upside, the 200 Simple Moving Average limited movement. On the other hand, a reversal from the hurdle found refuge above the 100 SMA on the 4-hour chart.

In the meantime, Ethereum is trading at $0.32 while buyers fight to take control over the price. Immediately below the current price level, $0.3 is the pivotal level that must be kept intact to avoid attracting high overhead pressure.

XRP buyers must also keep their eyes on $0.4 because breaking above the critical level would pave the way for gains above $0.6.

XRP/USD 4-hour chart

On the downside, massive sell orders are likely to be triggered if the cross-border token closes the day under $0.3. Such a price action would increase the gravitational pull on XRP, putting the 100 SMA and the 200 SMA to the ultimate test. Further down, Ripple will seek refuge at $0.2 and the December low at $0.17.","The rising tide of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) prices has lifted stock prices for Bitcoin mining companies.

There were no cryptocurrency mining outfits listed on the stock market during the 2017 bull run in Bitcoin prices. This time around, the situation is different. In the past month alone, stock prices for bitcoin mining companies Riot Blockchain, Inc. (RIOT) and Marathon Patent Group, Inc. (MARA) have shot up by 145% and 332%, respectively. China-based Canaan Inc. (CAN) has witnessed a 91% appreciation in its price during the same time period.

Key Takeaways Stock prices for Bitcoin mining companies have risen along with the increase in Bitcoin prices.

The close coupling between Bitcoin price and mining companies cannot mask bad financials and management.

Why Did Prices for Bitcoin Mining Companies Increase?

Since Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, the valuations for these companies are a function of the assets' demand in the marketplace rather than their business fundamentals. A higher price translates to greater profit margins for these companies.

Although Bitcoin proponents claim that anyone can mine it, the cryptocurrency's mining ecosystem is dominated by industrial outfits. This is primarily due to the considerable equipment and electricity costs associated with the activity. The difficulty level, which varies with time, of the algorithm used to award Bitcoin also inflates power consumption figures. Below a certain price threshold, Bitcoin mining becomes an unsustainable operation for individual miners and small mining farms during lean times in the cryptocurrency's wild price swings.

Cryptocurrency mining companies bring down their fixed costs by purchasing equipment in bulk and operating at scale to save on electricity costs. These tactics enable them to weather losses during price slumps. The opposite is also the case – i.e., profits for bitcoin mining operations increase as the price of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) rises.

In March last year, when a global pandemic shutdown was announced, Riot Blockchain and Marathon Patent Group were penny stocks. Since then, Bitcoin has emerged as a hedge against macroeconomic instability, and institutional investors have come calling. As Bitcoin's value skyrocketed, the stock prices for Riot and Marathon have shot up by an astounding 2,627% and 2,670%, respectively, since March. Not surprisingly, the companies announced further investments in mining equipment and expansion of their operations during their latest earnings calls.

Are Bitcoin Mining Companies a Buy?

The flipside to the existing price dynamic for Bitcoin mining companies is that valuations collapse when Bitcoin price craters. For example, Marathon Patent and Riot Blockchain reported losses and their stock prices flatlined through most of 2019 as Bitcoin struggled to break out of a coma in its prices.

The close coupling between Bitcoin price and stock valuations for crypto mining firms, however, doesn't mask bad financials or management. For example, investors sold off Canaan's stock last quarter amid a rising Bitcoin price trajectory after the company reported quarterly losses and inventory write-downs.

There's also the fact that Bitcoin, the most lucrative of all cryptocurrencies, has a capped supply of 21 million. Miners will have to shift to alternate revenue sources, such as transactions on Bitcoin's blockchain, to sustain their profits.","studioEAST | Getty Images

LONDON — Bitcoin's record-breaking rally has led to a surge in retail investment interest in the cryptocurrency market. Crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance and online trading platforms including Revolut and eToro have seen a spike in activity recently, as new investors race to capture some of the wild gains in the market. ""There is certainly market data pointing to increased retail participation,"" said Michael Bucella, partner at crypto investment firm BlockTower Capital. ""This is reflected in the recent surge in 'altcoins'"" — other digital tokens that came after bitcoin — ""and the increase in volumes on the retail platforms, as well as the crypto-native exchanges that have historically been more retail-focused,"" Bucella added. Bitcoin bulls claim the cryptocurrency's latest rally is different to a late-2017 bubble that saw its price soar close to $20,000 before collapsing as low as $3,122 the following year. The main difference, they say, is that institutional investors are driving the price gains this time round.

A number of famed investors including Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller came out as believers in the cryptocurrency last year, while U.K. asset management firm Ruffer added £550 million ($747 million) of bitcoin to its portfolio. There remain skeptics, however, such as American stock broker Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini, who see bitcoin as a speculative asset with no intrinsic value and a market bubble that is likely to burst at some point. Despite this, there are signs of a sharp rise in demand from retail investors, who don't want to miss out on the action. That may have significant implications for the latest crypto market cycle, as retail speculation was considered to be a big factor in bitcoin's 2017 rally.

Expect volatility

Google trends data shows that web searches for bitcoin rose sharply at the start of the month, reminding some market watchers of the parallel increase in bitcoin's price and searches for the cryptocurrency in December 2017. Searches for bitcoin are far from where they were over two years ago, however.

The total market value of all cryptocurrencies surpassed $1 trillion for the first time on Thursday, helped in no small part by bitcoin's recent performance. Bitcoin, which also topped $40,000 a coin for the first time Thursday, is the world's most valuable digital coin, with a market cap of over $700 billion. Meanwhile, online investment platforms are seeing a surge in sign-ups and trading volumes. EToro, for example, had 61% more unique bitcoin holders on Jan. 4 than it did a year earlier, and 49% more unique holders of ether, another virtual currency. ""There will be volatility, which is natural after the gains we have seen, but the long-term trend is clear,"" Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro, told CNBC. ""Crypto is moving into the mainstream, and more and more investors are adding exposure.""

Revolut says it signed up 300,000 new cryptocurrency customers over the last 30 days as bitcoin rallied to fresh highs. Bitcoin was the most popular digital currency on the platform in the last two weeks, followed by XRP and ether. Prices of altcoins, such as ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash, have risen dramatically in the past week. They often rally in times of strength for bitcoin — for example, ether on Monday climbed past $1,000, for the first time since February 2018. Bucella claimed that the recent gains in altcoins were ""largely driven by recent retail participation,"" while the ""dominant players in bitcoin are institutional."" Cryptocurrency trading volumes surged to a daily record of $68.3 billion on Sunday, according to data from CryptoCompare. That eclipsed the peak of the 2017 bull run in December, when daily volumes hit a high of $27.8 billion.

Mainstream adoption?

Many crypto investors say bitcoin is akin to ""digital gold,"" a potential safe haven asset and a hedge against inflation. Strategists at JPMorgan recently gave a lofty long-term price target of $146,000 for bitcoin, claiming it is starting to compete with gold as an ""alternative"" currency.

The risk of an abrupt reversal is high, as volatility in cryptocurrencies tends to be ignored by retail investors. Daniel Lacalle chief economist at Tressis Gestion

However, the strategists also noted that bitcoin's price volatility would have to drop substantially in order to reach this target. They added that there have been ""some signs that retail interest has also increased sharply,"" pointing to rising volumes on platforms like PayPal and Square's Cash App. PayPal last year launched a feature in the U.S. that lets its users invest in cryptocurrencies. The company plans to offer crypto shopping across its massive network of retailers later this year. The move was widely seen as a step toward mainstream adoption of crypto in things like payments. Daniel Lacalle, chief economist at Tressis Gestion, said bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have grown popular with retail investors in emerging markets, such as Argentina, Brazil and Turkey.

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Source: CryptoCompare","Bitcoin fans across the country are rallying against a common enemy, the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of President Donald Trump’s closest associates, has been working overtime since Thanksgiving to push several crypto regulations through before the Biden administration takes over on January 20, 2021.

FinCEN statements list the usual reasons for financial regulations, an effort to curtail terror financing, sanctions evasion and black market activity related to drugs and weapons, without any mention of new evidence justifying the unusual urgency.

These include a FinCEN proposal that would require exchanges to store records involving transactions over $3,000 sent to any personal wallets, plus report users to FinCEN for cumulative transactions worth more than $10,000 in a single day. For comparison, banks are required to flag cash withdrawals over $10,000, not transactions within the banking system itself, and banks are not required to keep tabs on where the customer spends the cash taken out of the system.

Plus, a complementary FinCEN statement proposed requiring Americans to report crypto holdings worth more than $10,000 at any foreign service provider. Although the details of this second initiative are still vague, it’s clear the Treasury wants to make special note of the know-your-customer information for anyone dealing with thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation called this a “push for more financial surveillance” without any need for warrants or suspicion. (Bitcoin users already need to report their holdings in their taxes, just like any other asset.) As such, over 65,615 crypto advocates submitted critical statements to FinCEN, including companies like Fidelity and Square. Square’s statement said the company “would be required to collect unreliable data about people [recipients] who have not opted into our service or signed up as our customers.”

The Washington D.C. nonprofit Coin Center issued a statement saying this proposal would also limit American access to decentralized services, where users may not know their counterparty or network operators. Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center’s research director, told TechCrunch the proposal is highly unusual because it only allowed for 15 days of comments, instead of the standard 60-day period, for a rule that would impose more data collection requirements on crypto companies than other financial institutions.

“It requires the exchange to collect, retain and report extra information that they don’t have to for a cash transaction, like the name and physical address of a counterparty,” he said. “It’s on a timeline to complete this process, as far as we know right now, before the new administration. That means the rule would be final. The new administration could issue a new rule, and overturn that past rule, but that’s a much more difficult process.”

Incoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, sworn in the first week of January, tweeted it was “ridiculous” for the Treasury to have this unusually short comment period. Likewise, nine members of Congress issued a letter warning this hasty rulemaking over the winter holidays undermined the legitimacy of the process.

These proposals aren’t just sudden, they’re also so vague that they appear poorly researched. Both Square Crypto developer Matt Corallo and MIT Media Lab director Neha Narula issued public statements saying the FinCEN proposals confused basic technical concepts about how bitcoin addresses work. This would make such regulations difficult to implement, burdening American companies with prohibitively high compliance precautions.

“Political motivations are always hard to discern, but public rumors have consistently indicated this is a personal push by Mnuchin, not further up or down,” Corallo said. “We’ll learn a lot about what the next few years look like based on what [incoming Secretary Janet] Yellen says and what new leadership at FinCEN looks like. There are a lot of things Yellen could decide, but it would be hard for her to do a worse job of building useful and practical regulations than Mnuchin’s last-minute attempts here.”

Van Valkenburgh said his nonprofit, and other crypto industry organizations like it, are prepared to challenge the ruling in court if the Trump administration fails to follow the legislative process. Namely, the Treasury is required to read and consider all of the public comments submitted by January 7, 2021, the arbitrary date set by the rulemakers themselves.

“They technically then have the power to issue the final rule, saying they considered all the comments,” he said. “But if it’s obvious that they didn’t consider all the comments, which I feel like it would be if the final rule came out any time before the new administration comes in, it would be very easy to argue in court that the requirement to read and consider all the comments has not been met.”

As it stands, Van Valkenburgh said it appears the outgoing administration intends to “saddle” the incoming administration with “chaos.”","Disclosure

The price of bitcoin is volatile these days, so I apologize if real-time prices differ significantly. As I began this writing, bitcoin nearly hit $42,000 per token -- an all-time high -- though it's since cooled off a little. Still, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled in just one month. And its market capitalization is now over $750 billion. Yes, billion.

When something this big goes up this fast, it's bound to attract attention as investors look for hidden ways to profit from the trend. Small-cap cryptocurrency stocks have been popular vehicles and many are on the rise again today. Consider these moves as of 12:30 p.m. EST:

Shares of Marathon Patent Group NASDAQ:MARA)

Shares of Riot Blockchain NASDAQ:RIOT)

Shares of Bit Digital NASDAQ:BTBT)

But not all crypto/blockchain stocks were rising today. For example, Xunlei Limited (NASDAQ:XNET) stock and Ebang International Holdings (NASDAQ:EBON) stock were down 15% and 6% respectively. This is a big change from yesterday when Xunlei was the big winner and Bit Digital was losing.

Finally, making its debut in my crypto coverage is Future FinTech Group (NASDAQ:FTFT). The stock is up 31% today but it had nearly doubled earlier in the session. I believe Future FinTech has something to teach investors today. Note the company was formerly known as SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc. And no, I'm not kidding.

So what

Future FinTech Group is self-described as ""a leading blockchain based e-commerce company and a financial technology service provider."" But it wasn't always. Until 2019, its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) say it was ""engaged in the production and sales of fruit juice concentrates, fruit juice beverages and other fruit-related products in the People's Republic of China."" The juice business got too hard, though (high costs and environmental concerns were the cited reasons), so the company decided to offer financial technology (fintech) services instead.

Yesterday, Future FinTech issued a press release saying it's successfully copyrighted 10 blockchain applications in China. The company notes its commitment to blockchain because of its application in areas like record-keeping and identity security, among other things -- and I agree that's the real-world possible value of blockchain technology. Tokenized assets such as bitcoin are just one possible application of the underlying tech.

However, investors interested in Future FinTech stock need to keep in mind that ""future"" is a very apt description of this company. In the company's investor presentation, it notes it generated $314,000 in revenue for the period ending June 30, 2020. Not million -- thousand. And it also had less than $1 million on its balance sheet at the time.

Future FinTech's SEC filings note a ""going concern,"" meaning there's reasonable doubt for the long-term viability of this business. Perhaps its blockchain enhanced e-commerce sites are the future. But for now, this incorporated-in-Florida but doing-business-in-China fruit juice company turned fintech player needs cash. It all sounds fishy to me. Don't be surprised if yesterday's good news regarding copyrights is followed up with a stock offering in the near future. We've seen this movie before. For example, just a few days ago Marathon raised $200 million by selling stock.

Now what

To me, Future FinTech stock demonstrates just how hungry investors are for life-changing stock market returns. Obscure small-cap stocks and penny stocks seem to be where people are looking. The other cryptocurrency stocks mentioned in this article have all been bid up to lofty valuations with little fundamental support from their businesses. Sure, miners like Riot Blockchain, Marathon, and Bit Digital are better off as bitcoin rises. But their valuations seem excessive at this point.

If you've caught a five-, ten-, or even 20-bagger in a matter of months, I congratulate you. I truly do. But investors should always keep in mind the risk they're taking on. I would never risk my hard-earned money on a fruit juice company trying to develop blockchain technology with less than $1 million in the bank. I wouldn't risk it because I simply don't have to -- low-risk stocks with multibagger potential are all around. The trick is finding them, buying them, and holding them for a really long time.

Bitcoin could keep rising, leading to further volatility in the stocks mentioned here and more in the days and weeks ahead. As Bit Digital, Ebang, and Xunlei demonstrate, you can never know for sure what will happen on a day-to-day basis or when the music will ultimately end. For that reason, I strongly recommend investors use the majority of their investable money on a diversified portfolio of low-risk, high-reward stocks.","International Game Technology PLC (IGT), the world's biggest maker of slot machines, has filed for a patent that enables gamblers to transfer Bitcoin (BTCUSD) from their online wallets to their account at a gambling establishment. ""IGT secured this patent to bolster its industry-leading patent portfolio in anticipation of any possible future direction in regulated gaming involving cryptocurrency,"" a spokesperson from the company told Bloomberg.

According to the patent, ""… the instructions cause the gaming establishment component processor to escrow the amount of cryptocurrency, establish a line of credit based on the escrowed amount of cryptocurrency, and modify a balance of a gaming establishment account based on the line of credit.""

Key Takeaways IGT has filed for a patent that enables slot machine players to transfer Bitcoin from their online wallet to their account at a gaming establishment.

The move could open up new markets for Bitcoin.

Lines of Credit

In simple words, this means that, until the time that the actual cryptocurrency transfer takes place between the crypto wallet and the player's account, the gambler will be able to fund his gaming by using a line of credit at the establishment. While it details the operational aspects of the transaction, the patent does not provide detail on associated fees and transaction costs for the transfers.

Millennials and those between 18 and 29 years of age comprised a majority of visitors to slot machines in Las Vegas, according to 2018 statistics. That should be good news for casinos with this technology because the younger demographic is comfortable with Bitcoin as a concept and its use as a transaction medium. The proliferation of smartphones also means that it should be relatively easy to implement cashless systems for transfer between two accounts.

IGT's patent could open up new markets for cryptocurrencies. While there are several Bitcoin ATMs in Las Vegas, casinos have only allowed the use of the cryptocurrency for the purchase of food and drink and shied away from allowing it on the casino floor. The Nevada Gaming Commission decided last year to allow transfers from digital wallets (and not bank accounts) to gaming accounts. IGT recently announced a digital wallet, called Resort Wallet, to enable the transfer of money from and to slot machines."
2021-01-09,"For all the talk about bitcoin (and broadly crypto) being easier to buy than ever before, Friday morning, as bitcoin was topping $41,000 per coin, I spent hours trying to make a small $100 purchase.

According to some, the latest rally was initiated by institutional investors looking for a hedge against fiat inflation and the U.S. dollar’s decline in foreign exchange markets, and they seem to be having no problem buying – the price has shot up $20,000 in less than a month.

But if my experience is an example of what other retail investors are dealing with, there’s still plenty of frustration to be had with the crypto markets. And think how much higher the price could be if all these newbie investors could get their hands on some of that sweet, sweet digital gold.

Transaction declined

This maddening adventure into purchasing more bitcoin to hodl started not as panic that I was going to miss out; no, I’ve been in the space since late 2012 and have seen the majority of the bull runs and bear markets. I am in no hurry to buy at the top.

But I was using this revival as a time to set up recurring purchases with these mainstream mobile apps that are touting easy crypto buying as the technology matures.

I started with Square’s Cash App, an application I’ve used plenty, loading money into my account to then take advantage of the boosts, like $1 off any coffee-shop purchase. But when trying to set up a bi-weekly purchase of bitcoin, I got the “something went wrong” error message. What, though!? What the hell went wrong!? (Stock purchases were also declined.)

OK, no problem, I’ve had a Coinbase account for many years and have purchased crypto with that account, so that should be an easy buy. Except that it wasn’t. After updating my card details from an old debit card, I put in a buy order that was promptly declined.

For f**k’s sake.

Next, I tried Blockchain.com, what was probably my first bitcoin wallet ever, besides a paper wallet. That transaction was denied based on my residence being in New York where they don’t operate (thanks a lot, BitLicense).

How about Gemini, then, where just a couple weeks ago, I purchased some DeFi tokens? On the first try, the purchase was declined because the market moved, so the displayed price had changed. I tried again – begrudgingly, because the fees on a $100 transaction were nearly $6.50 – and a couple seconds later received an email, “Success! Your buy order is complete.”

Finally! Except, wait, nope, 30 minutes later I received another email stating the transfer failed and the buy order was not completed.

Failed buy order + frustration. (Bailey Reutzel)

Maybe all these services are overwhelmed by demand? Both Coinbase and Kraken suffered outages this week during the run.

Robinhood was next. I was instructed to deposit money into my account before I could buy, but after putting my routing and account number in the app stated my financial institution is not supported (Robinhood seems to be using Plaid for connecting bank accounts).

Binance.US? Didn’t work, either, again on the basis of not doing business with customers residing in New York. I tried inputting my parent’s address in the Midwest, which allowed me a first level of verification, but to buy bitcoin you need to go through the advanced verification, requiring a picture of a bank statement or utility bill. My driver’s license still shows my former Midwest address, but that wasn’t a sufficient form of verification at this stage.

Lastly, it dawned on me that PayPal just began allowing crypto purchases, so I logged into my account. While a button on the homepage said “Discover Bitcoin,” when I clicked it, it took me to my dashboard, which had no clear way to buy bitcoin. By this time, I was fuming and called a friend to have him check his ability to purchase. He was able to buy in seconds.

So now, I’m thinking that I’m on some kind of blacklist; maybe harping on how banks suck and crypto companies that play by traditional finance’s rules are selling out has finally caught up with me.

But after some troubleshooting, I realized it was because my PayPal account is a business account (pretty arbitrarily really), so I went through the process of setting up a separate individual account, which I had to link to a random, burner email account. From that individual account dashboard, the “buy bitcoin” button was right up front and so I put through an order and received a note that my transaction had gone through.

But for anyone not interested in carrying out all these different setups for the story, this kind of process is infuriating, and I’d assume any novice crypto buyer would have given up after the second rejection.

The main problem

Which brings me to what appears to be the real issue – my traditional financial institution.

I bank with a state credit union in Colorado. After trying these various routes to “financial freedom,” I called its customer service line. I’ve had to call it before to open up payments applications, such as Zelle, so I figured I’d just need to tell it to take the blocks off my account (I’ve bought crypto in the past using this bank-branded debit card).

But after being on hold, the customer service agent told me all crypto transactions are “considered very high risk” and declines them, no matter whether I assure them it’s a transaction I want to make or not.

She told me to contact each of the companies directly and see if there was another way to make a purchase – for instance, I could maybe pay directly out of my checking account – but when trying to input my account details before, the credit union didn’t seem to be supported.

This new risk aversion to anything crypto-related is strange. The bitcoin industry has matured substantially and, in many enthusiasts’ eyes, running towards $50,000 per coin means the incumbents, the status quo, the powers that be, have no choice but to take us seriously now.

That doesn’t appear to be the case.","Reuters/Lucas Jackson

Bitcoin has more than doubled in less than a month, leaving analysts and investors stunned and concerned about a possible market bubble.

In many ways the token's rally in recent months is crucially different than the surge seen three years ago, as buyers now range from casual day traders to fund managers handling billions of dollars in assets.

Easy monetary conditions and trillions of dollars in fiscal stimulus have led some investors to view the token as a new inflation hedge.

Detailed below are the factors driving bitcoin higher, and why experts don't think the cryptocurrency will crash as it did in 2017.

Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories.

It took nearly 11 years for bitcoin to reach $20,000 per coin for the first time in 2017. Just 22 days later, the world's most popular cryptocurrency has surged another $20,000, and its momentum is so far holding strong.

Bitcoin's rapid climb back in 2017 was swiftly followed by sell-offs that erased the bulk of its quickly earned gains. But no such trend has emerged this time around, and experts say a combination of factors fueled the token's surge through 2020 and will continue to boost bitcoin in the new year.

Detailed below are three reasons behind bitcoin's price spike, and a discussion of why it's unlikely to suffer a crash similar to that seen two years ago.

(1) Fear of missing out

While passionate retail investors powered bitcoin's 2017 rally, public companies sparked the token's latest climb. MicroStrategy started a chain reaction when it bought $425 million worth of bitcoin in August and September, Jimmy Nguyen, president of the Bitcoin Association, told Insider. The move opened the door for other public companies to view bitcoin as a viable reserve asset.

Square followed in October with its own $50 million purchase. Still, it wasn't until PayPal adopted bitcoin that prices began to rocket higher. The company announced on October 21 that it would allow its hundreds of millions of users to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin. The token leaped to its highest level since July 2019 as investors saw the adoption as a key step forward for bitcoin's widespread use.

""People are seeing a move to it as a reserve asset, knowing there's a limited supply of Bitcoin, and saying, 'okay, I want my piece of it before it goes too high in price,"" Nguyen said.

The subsequent rise in bitcoin prices then pulled institutional investors into the fray. Fund managers who previously balked at the token and its violent price swings feared they were missing out on strong returns and began shifting some cash into the cryptocurrency.

Institutional investors have since pushed billions of dollars into the cryptocurrency market. Their involvement has played the biggest part in the token's meteoric rise through the end of 2020, according to Douglas Borthwick, chief marketing officer at digital-asset trading platform INX.

""If you don't have something in your portfolio that's performing well, then you're not going to perform well. People are going to leave your fund,"" Borthwick told Insider. ""You've got larger and larger position sizes chasing a smaller and smaller number of bitcoin in circulation.""

(2) Demand for inflation hedges

Bitcoin may first seem completely disconnected from the coronavirus pandemic, but the health crisis' fallout has played a critical role in supporting token prices. Governments around the world passed several trillion dollars worth of fiscal stimulus to pad against the pandemic's economic damage.

The influx of fresh currency and easy monetary conditions boosted the case for bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in November. A limited supply of 21 million tokens and insulation from policy decisions saw the token serve as an alternative to gold and other hedge assets.

""That money printing has meant that everyone in the world has been searching for hard assets to invest in, something that isn't going up in terms of supply,"" Borthwick said.

(3) Increase legitimacy

Companies and institutional investors warming up to bitcoin has given legitimacy to an asset recently known more for its murky uses than its investment potential. During the token's 2017 rally, those less familiar with cryptocurrencies associated them with ""nefarious activities,"" Borthwick said.

PayPal's adoption and the influx of institutional funds lend bitcoin new legitimacy and interest among retail investors, Borthwick added. And just yesterday, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said national banks can use blockchain networks and stablecoins for payments, further legitimizing digital currencies.

""The more big names get involved in the space and the more regulators start writing regulations about it, the more it becomes a mainstream asset,"" Borthwick said.

Curiosity among everyday investors exploded through the end of last year. Global search interest for bitcoin more than tripled from early October to early January, according to Google Trends data. Celebrities ranging from actress Maisie Williams to rapper Meek Mill have tweeted about entering the cryptocurrency market. In a matter of months, the crowd pushing cash into bitcoin has evolved from fund managers and crypto-fanatics to practically everybody else, Borthwick said.

""There's an absolute land rush to get invested in the crypto space,"" he added. ""It's no longer friends and family and old friends from college.""

What's ahead for the red-hot cryptocurrency

Bitcoin's rapid doubling has naturally prompted some investors to deem the token a bubble. JPMorgan said Monday that the token's rally moves it ""into more challenging territory,"" and that a continued climb at its current pace would likely ""prove unsustainable.""

The market very well may be ""prone to a sort of correction,"" but it's unlikely to resemble that seen three years ago, Nguyen said. Institutional investors are poised to maintain their bitcoin positions for fear of prematurely selling and missing out on additional returns.

Growing interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies also protects prices from returning to the recent lows, Borthwick said

""What you're talking about here is the adoption of something by everybody in the world over a very short period of time,"" he said. ""When you talk about a new technology, I don't think there ever is such a thing as a top.""

Is bitcoin too risky for the average investor?

Compared to most investments, bitcoin ""is a highly volatile, highly risky investment,"" James Ledbetter, editor of fintech newsletter FIN and CNBC contributor, tells CNBC Make It. ""If you look historically at the price of bitcoin, there have been a number of occasions where it's really spiked and then comes crashing down really quickly."" (For example, after rallying to nearly $20,000 in 2017, bitcoin's price collapsed and lost a third of its value in a single day, and in 2018, it dropped to as low as $3,122, wiping out billions of dollars from the total cryptocurrency market value.) While that can mean big returns, it can also mean big losses. That's why some, like investor Mark Cuban, liken bitcoin to gambling and advise investing only as much money as you can afford to lose. ""You have to at least be mentally prepared and financially prepared that [a crash] could happen again. It could happen tomorrow,"" Ledbetter says. Of course, despite its high selling price, ""you can go and buy as little as even $5 of bitcoin because there is the ability to buy fractional shares called satoshis,"" points out Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of cryptocurrency hedge fund Morgan Creek Digital Assets and a bitcoin investor. ""Just start very small, do research, learn about it,"" Pompliano says. (If you do decide to invest, Pompliano supports holding bitcoin long-term. By design, there is a limited supply of bitcoin, so bitcoin bull Pompliano believes as demand increases, the price will as well.)

Are bitcoin 'wallets' safe?

In July, a widespread Twitter hack compromised many celebrity accounts – including that of President-elect Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, to name a few – in a bitcoin scam. As a result, hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin had been transferred under false pretenses. For many, this prompted questions around the safety of bitcoin. ""There have been multiple examples of bitcoin theft and fraud that I think would give pause to the average investor, particularly if you were going to invest a substantial amount. I think those are legitimate fears,"" Ledbetter says. But he also finds them ""overblown."" Because while bitcoin allows for users to transact without revealing personal information or identity (potentially making fraud easier), it's not totally anonymous. Each bitcoin transaction is documented on a digital ledger called the blockchain, where a user's cryptocurrency ""wallet"" is represented as a unique series of random numbers and letters. Through this, a scammer could potentially be traced after the fact. ""I always remind people that bitcoin literally has a public ledger,"" Pompliano says. Plus, bitcoin is extremely hard to hack thanks to blockchain. ""To hack it, you would have to take over the network, and to take over the network, you would need your own network of computers running 24/7, and to do that, it would cost billions of dollars,"" according to Paul Vigna, markets reporter at The Wall Street Journal. Ledbetter also points out that a traditional stock account with a brokerage could be compromised too. ""There's always some potential for fraud or security risk."" The safest bet is to use a trusted brokerage, experts say – ""these established places have a good security protocol and a quick application to protect,"" Ledbetter says. All in all, ""things happen,"" he says, ""but when you look at the big stories of theft, they tend to be institutional and kind of on the fringes."" According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website, cryptocurrency scams are ""a popular way for scammers to trick people into sending money,"" and most scams can ""appear as emails trying to blackmail someone, online chain referral schemes, or bogus investment and business opportunities."" ""It's not like there's something intrinsically unsafe about bitcoin itself– it's more how people are handling or managing it,"" Ledbetter says.

Can bitcoin be easily converted to fiat and transferred?

Currently, most mainstream bitcoin transactions are done by converting bitcoin to fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar. (For instance, PayPal announced that in 2021, consumers will be able to use cryptocurrency as a ""funding source for purchases."" But what that really means is when a user ""pays"" with bitcoin, it ""will be instantly converted to fiat currency and the transaction will be settled with the PayPal merchants in fiat currency,"" according to PayPal's website.) And as of now, that process of transferring bitcoin to other accounts and converting it to different currencies, whether the U.S. dollar or other cryptocurrency, is ""clunky"" and time consuming, says Ledbetter.

Plus, if you're using bitcoin for transactions, ""you really need to read the fine print – there are usually fees associated with those transactions, but some of that will probably ease up a little bit over time,"" Ledbetter says. Along with fees, ""sellers do not have the confidence to do large transactions yet in bitcoin,"" investor Kevin O'Leary, chairman of O'Shares ETFs, told Pompliano on ""The Pomp Podcast"" in December. ""I'm sure this could change over time, but not today."" In the future, Pompliano predicts innovation will result in technology that ""makes it easier to spend bitcoin with quicker transactions that are cheaper, more efficient, more usable.""

Is bitcoin a bubble?

Can bitcoin be used as a hedge against inflation?","It’s been over a decade since the introduction of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, but you’d be forgiven for never adding it to your investments — or even still not quite knowing what it is or how it works. After its value reached record highs at the end of 2017, with early crypto adopters like tax-evading John McAfee declaring it wasn’t a bubble because Bitcoin bubbles “are mathematically impossible in this new paradigm,” it turned out to be a bubble, it crashed, and lots of people lost lots of money.

Bitcoin entered a period where many thought of it as a failed experiment, proof that the traditional frameworks of physical currency and stock markets would triumph over the newfangled, digital-native entity. Then, after a smaller slump at the start of the pandemic, the price of Bitcoin started climbing, and climbing, and climbing, and then full-on spiking.

This week, the price of one Bitcoin eclipsed $41,000, over double the price during the 2017 bubble, as reported by Bloomberg. How did this happen after the cryptocurrency became a financial laughingstock in 2018, and especially during the pandemic?

The best explanation is a relatively simple one, as outlined by the Wall Street Journal: “Bitcoin’s price has been rising for months in conjunction with stocks, emerging markets and commodity prices as investors have flocked to riskier assets in response to the aggressive monetary policies enacted by central banks to combat the economic collapse caused by the coronavirus pandemic.”

Essentially, the stock market has been doing gangbusters despite the financial devastation COVID-19 has unleashed on the general public, and that confidence carries over to Bitcoin, the most significant cryptocurrency. Just look at the one-year timeline of the Nasdaq or S&P 500 and you’ll see the trajectory somewhat matches that of Bitcoin.

The differentiating factor came in October 2020 when the cryptocurrency started to slope upwards and skyrocket, far outperforming traditional markets. Oanda analyst Craig Erlam described it to the Journal as a rally “driven by FOMO alone,” but it’s a little more complex than investors not wanting to miss out on huge gains.

The reason the value of Bitcoin is hitting even higher heights than before is because it’s broken more into the mainstream in the last few years, meaning institutional investors feel more confident adding it to their assets and, as Bloomberg writes, there’s less of a barrier to entry for “stuck-at-home day traders” who are happy to engage in “rampant speculation.”

It’s likely that speculation will end badly once again, and the bubble will burst, but when that happens is anyone’s guess.

For those who don’t currently have any skin in the game, should you consider getting into Bitcoin? After all, PayPal and Square have given it their stamp of approval, and it’s likely to continue to see wider acceptance.

On Bloomberg Surveillance, financial journalist Eddie van der Walt offered his take: “In a sense, yes, it’s mainstream in that it is available to everybody, but it is not mainstream in the sense that everybody owns it, everybody should own it and it’s going to impact every portfolio out there.”

In other words, like any casino game investment, it depends on your risk tolerance.

(Bloomberg) -- For investment firms that profit by buying the debt of troubled companies, it looked like the opportunity of a lifetime: a $1 trillion pile of distressed bonds and loans in the Americas alone as the pandemic sent markets into meltdown last March.But after a massive federal bailout and rock-bottom interest rates kept even some of the shakiest companies afloat, those juicy targets have shriveled to less than $100 billion. That’s left distressed-debt specialists -- who at one point last year had $131 billion to spend -- rummaging for increasingly elusive bargains. Even the real estate sector, which was hammered after the pandemic shuttered offices, hotels and stores, has managed for now to avoid an epic wipeout.So, how are distressed-debt investors -- often among of the savviest in the markets -- deploying all that cash? A few, like Caspian Capital, decided to return some money to investors because the rewards wouldn’t justify the high risks anymore.Others are looking farther afield. Olympus Peak Asset Management is dipping into things like unpaid vendor claims in firms that are already bankrupt. Arena Investors is picking through convertible bonds and real estate loans cast off by banks. And giants of the business like Oaktree Capital Management are rustling around in Asia for opportunities.“People aren’t investing, they’re just chasing,” said Adam Cohen, Caspian’s managing partner. And this comes with an extra helping of risk, according to Oaktree co-founder Howard Marks, the dean of distressed investing. “To get to higher returns these days, you have to be willing to extend credit to somebody who is not clearly coming back,” Marks said in a Bloomberg TV interview.The money nevertheless continues to roll in, and managers have made some progress at finding new places to put it. About 40 funds -- from Oaktree to Angelo Gordon & Co. -- collected about $35 billion between this year and last, according to consultants at Preqin.For Arena Investors, a $2.2 billion investment firm, going smaller and nimble has had its advantages, said Chief Executive Officer Dan Zwirn. That’s because 80% of distressed companies in early April had less than $1 billion of debt outstanding, and about 60% of the companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year owed less than $500 million. That’s left too many larger firms chasing the few big situations that are left.“When you’re writing checks above $100 million, the level of competition is excessive,” Zwirn said.Arena deployed almost all of the $519 million it raised for a special opportunities strategy last year, targeting industries dislocated by the pandemic. Among the things they’ve been active in: real estate loans, special-situation lending in energy and aviation and litigation finance.Tighter LendingFund managers like Olympus Peak are also looking at companies that are too small to tap into the seemingly limitless bond and equity markets, which were supercharged last year by the unprecedented wave of federal stimulus.Large public-market borrowers have been mostly picked over by now. Smaller companies, on the other hand, have relied more on banks for liquidity. And the percentage of banks making it tougher to get a loan is still high at 11.4%, according to the Federal Reserve, well above the 1.9% average since the great financial crisis.“If you can only do public-market distress, you just have to hold your position, because if you sell it, there’s nothing else to buy,” said Jason Dillow, chief executive officer at the $8.4 billion Bardin Hill Investment Partners.Biggest Distressed/Special Situations Funds of 2020-2021Either way, distressed fund managers are trying a variety of tactics to drum up returns, according to people familiar with the portfolios:Bardin Hill raised $600 million for privately negotiated credit in early February and deployed about 78% of it. The cash went into high-end cruise lines, fitness, technology, health care and education, along with alternative assets such as insurance-backed claims.Olympus Peak, which runs a $1.4 billion hedge fund, started a $300 million fund this month focused on vendor claims that arise out of bankruptcies. So-called trade claims are often small, illiquid and labor-intensive, and thus less attractive for a larger fund.Angelo Gordon collected $3.5 billion at the beginning of the pandemic and invested all of it, plus $1 billion in recycled capital. It favored privately negotiated financings with high yields and strong protections for its investment written into its agreements.Centerbridge Partners’ Special Credit III strategy invested $1.8 billion in March and April of 2020. It has since traded out of 90% of those positions. The cash was redeployed into growth companies such as HCI Group Inc. and rescue financing for businesses such as cinema chains, including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., its U.K. subsidiary Odeon, and Cineworld Group Plc.As of February, Monarch Alternative Capital had invested more than 60% of the $3 billion it raised last year for its latest distressed credit fund. The firm lent to bankrupt businesses after the pandemic shut them down temporarily. The roster included a franchisee for Wendy’s and Pizza Hut, Ann Taylor’s parent company Ascena Retail Group, and the owner of Chuck E. Cheese, with Monarch looking beyond the pandemic and at times boosting its investment to keep the companies afloat.D.E. Shaw & Co. raised $1 billion for its latest private credit fund that targets stressed assets and financings with a 5-year investment window, the firm said Tuesday.For Cohen’s $3.5 billion Caspian Capital, distressed-debt investing is too narrow a mandate in today’s world, so the firm broadened into firms that are merely stressed. It’s looking for 10% to 15% yields, or credits that trade between 70 and 90 cents on the dollar but aren’t in default.Even with that wider purview, Caspian decided to close its $500 million dislocation strategy fund after cashing out when prices rebounded. Investors got back $565 million.“Money always burns a hole in your pocket,” Cohen said. “The best thing you can do now is not make a mistake. That can save you a lot more money than mediocre trades can make you.”To be sure, firms with patient capital don’t have to invest right away, and there could be a bigger wave of opportunities after policymakers scale back economic support, according to JPMorgan Asset Management’s David Lebovitz.In the meantime, Oaktree is looking to raise $15 billion for its latest distressed fund and put its money to work outside the U.S. So far, public filings show, only about 10% of its pledged capital was drawn as of February. Oaktree’s pitch to investors cited almost $5 trillion in opportunities across Asia, mostly China, including non-performing loans, bonds, shadow-banking loans and leveraged loans.The lingering question is whether the distressed assets that remain are destined for a recovery, or whether they’re simply being kept afloat by an historic dead-cat bounce that won’t last.“If you had a fundamentally strong business, you could’ve found the liquidity to make it through the challenges of 2020,” Chris Acito, chief investment officer of Gapstow Capital Partners, a New York-based firm that specializes in picking credit-fund managers. “Many of the businesses which are still in distress have flawed business models that will be difficult to revive.”(Updates with D.E.

A bitcoin user has shared his story of how he lost more than $100,000 in BTC during a wallet transfer. The bitcoiner attempted to transfer a wallet to a new computer without making sure that he had access to the encryption passwords tied to his private key storage.

Password Manager Didn’t Store Passphrases Needed to Access His Private Keys

According to the testimony published on Reddit, the crypto user known as “Onnar” claimed to have lost access to 2.6 BTC from the transfer of his wallet to a new computer acquired during the Christmas holidays.

He wiped the hard disk of his old computer, which he wanted to use only for work-related matters. However, he did not check the password manager he used to store the passphrases needed to access the wallet’s private keys.

Onnar detailed that he had already encrypted backups of his private keys on two USB drives stored in separate locations. He then plugged one of the USB drives into the computer to verify that everything was properly stored, which he later realized that it was not enough.

Could a Hardware Wallet Have Prevented This Error?

Although the crypto user admitted that a Ledger device would be more convenient than the way he was handling his bitcoins, he did not believe at the time that his method was less safe. Onnar continued:

Let’s start with BTC. To import the private key, I just have to decrypt the file from one of the two USB drives and, well… just import it … The terminal now asks for … the password. No problem, I have all my passwords in my password manager, which I trust 100%. I go to my password manager to grab it and… It’s not there. No mention of a BTC password anywhere to be found. I spend the next 30 mins rechecking and rechecking, but it’s not there.

The bitcoiner made a mea culpa of the incident, admitting that he did not realize that passwords were not auto-saved in the manager.

He wrapped up by taking full responsibility for missing bitcoins worth over $100,000, according to the latest data by markets.Bitcoin.com. He concluded:

It’s 100% my fault anyway.

As Yash woke up from his alarm tone, he rushed to get his laptop and quickly wore a clean shirt and a tie before even freshening up. The daily sprint update meeting was about to start in a minute. He swiftly chose a quiet corner in the house and sat in front of the screen, ready to report to his manager. Followed by 6-8 hours of working on his project and simultaneously managing the household chores, he dozed off early to start the same cycle again tomorrow.

This is how the life of every working professional has become since the lockdown was imposed due to coronavirus flare-up in the country. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has stirred up businesses like never before. Although with the passing time, companies have managed to sail through, taking some remedial measures still need to continue in the coming time. If we talk about the employee morale going down, the only way to keep the spirit alive is by organizing rewards & recognition programs even in these tough times as employees continue to work from home.

Here are 5 major ways to develop post-COVID reward & recognition in the corporate world:

Being Vocal For Local

It has been observed that local stores and vendors have suffered huge losses due to the coronavirus pandemic. Given the downfall in small-scale businesses, it is time to support them and come forward to bring them up by purchasing gifts articles from them and give away the same to your employees as rewards.

You can also give them monetary benefits based on their contribution and use the payroll software to include the same in the salary of the employees. Being “vocal for local” is one of the most impactful initiatives that the government is also promoting for the startups to control the damage suffered by them.

WFH-Specific Rewards

Since employees have been working from home day and night even during the lockdown period, it is imperative that they get something in return. So, many organizations have started a reward system specific to the work from home culture.

For instance, if the daily deliverables are met by the employees working remotely, then they are recognized by EOD. If the performance is evaluated on a monthly basis, then the same is taken into account at the time of salary release. And similarly, the employees’ contribution to business growth is also considered during the annual R&R program.

Virtual R&R Programs

As most of the organizations have permitted their workforce to work remotely, physical presence in the office premises is not a thing these days. Therefore, it is the employer’s or HR professionals’ duty to keep the working spark alive amongst the employees and maintain their productivity by conducting virtual reward sessions.

Through zoom calls, google meets, or other video conferencing platforms, the R&R programs can be organized easily, whenever necessary. Moreover, these events can be made fun by adding virtual games and recreational activities to the same.

Giving Away Safety Kits

“Desperate times call for desperate measures.” These challenging situations are unpredictable and have caused a deep impact on everyone’s life. Given the uncertainty of such unfortunate events like the sudden spread of COVID-19, organizations have started taking extra care of their employees.

It is now a vital part of the system to provide safety and sanitation products to the professionals just like any other basic necessity. So, it is also a thoughtful gift to offer your workforce a complete safety kit which contains hand sanitizers, N-95 masks, soaps, and indoor plants, etc. This is going to be one of the most considerate and useful rewards for the employees as it is the need of the hour.

Recognizing The Plus Ones

As a result of the full-time work from home regime since the lockdown was first implemented, employers have had the chance to know the families of their employees better than before. Hence, it would be a good gesture if the organization starts thinking about the “plus ones” of the employees too.

Several benefits can be provided to the parents, spouse, siblings, children, or even pets of the employees who perform well or contribute extraordinarily to the organization’s growth in such a testing time. At the end, the payroll software can be used to take care of the budgetary parameters and make calculations for each reward given to the employees’ families.

Employees can also be offered redeemable reward points or vouchers for online shopping since they can’t go out amid all the social/physical distancing. Else, on the basis of their performance, the workforce can be awarded virtual money or points which can be converted into real money and added to their accounts directly.

Besides, employers can also provide several medical benefits such as compensation on medicines, regular body check-ups, and enroll for health insurance schemes among others to ensure financial aid for them. In this way, the employees can easily sail through the course of global pandemic and be prepared to tackle similar problems in the future.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to a low of $37,194 on Sunday, January 10, 2021, after hitting its all time high a day and half prior. Currently, BTC is down over 6.4% and is trading for $38,239 per unit during Sunday’s afternoon trading sessions (EST).

On Saturday and Sunday, while BTC consolidated, ethereum (ETH) jumped to a 2021 price high of $1,340 per coin. ETH is still up today over 4% and is swapping for $1,285 per token on Sunday.

Another cryptocurrency that has seen significant gains this weekend is bitcoin cash (BCH) which is up 14% today. However, yesterday BCH was up over 30% and traded at a 2021 high of $625 per unit. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is currently trading for $612 per coin and has a market cap of around $11.2 billion.

Litecoin (LTC) did very well on Saturday as well, spiking to $185 per unit and today the coin is swapping for 170 per LTC. The crypto asset LTC is only down 1% during the last 24 hours and commands a market cap of around $11.3 billion on Sunday.

Another strong runner this weekend in terms of gains is monero’s (XMR) market valuation. XMR jumped to $174 per coin and the crypto asset is still up over 18% on Sunday. Data from markets.Bitcoin.com shows monero’s overall market valuation is only $3 billion today.

The top five gainers on Sunday have seen gains between 40% to 91% and include coins such as stakenet, bitcoin diamond, ethereum classic, ultrain, and horizen. The top losers on Sunday include appcoins, nexus, navcoin, everex and golem as the assets have lost between -19% to -30% in value today.

After the BTC all-time price high pushed the Bitcoin Dominance Index (BDI) to 70% recently, the recent value spikes from other coins have pushed the BDI down to 68%.

At the time of publication, the entire crypto market economy is still valued at over 1.03 trillion U.S. dollars. The overall market cap is still up over 7% despite the losses BTC has taken during the last 24 hours.

Less than only 10 days after that Bitcoin price prediction, the flagship crypto-asset has already managed to deliver on the call — surging around 40% to surpass the $41,000 with relative ease.

As for the rest of 2021, investors may have to deal with a lot of volatility that may strike with just as much intensity to the downside before recovering in a possible quadrupling of the Bitcoin price, according to Thomas Lee from Fundstrat.

In statements shared with Yahoo Finance, Lee remarked:

“It’s a hyper-volatile asset. Our roadmap for risk assets this year is that stocks would be pretty explosive out of the gate and peak sometime either in late January but as late as April around S&P 4,000 before a big drawdown happens. If the S&P falls 10%, Bitcoin is going to have a huge drawdown… it could be 40% to 50%.”

While that may seem like a lot, Lee confirms that it’s on par for the course when you consider BTC’s historical price movements, and the same pattern that had suggested BTC’s explosion to $40,000+. Back in 2017, the digital asset surged over 1,200% after the last time the BTC reward for miners was reduced in half in an algorithmic process called the Bitcoin halving (back in 2016). The most recent BTC halving took place in May of last year.

Lee added:

“That’s a pretty typical correction for crypto. In fact, I think last year it had a couple of drawdowns nearly that size.”

Notably, Bitcoin price fell over 40% in just a few weeks during November 2019 and also in March 2020 when the financial markets crashed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But even if the drawdown is as severe as Lee has estimated, he still thinks the ensuing or gradual recovery might still result in Bitcoin surging over 300% in 2021.

He stated:

“If it looks like 2017. I think Bitcoin will be up at least 300%. I don’t think it’s straight up with a ruler, it’s going to be pretty jagged but at the end of the year, Bitcoin is much higher.”

JPMorgan analysts recently predicted that Bitcoin might reach $146,000 in the long-term, if the crypto-asset referred to as “digital gold” were to begin replacing the same level of private wealth currently held in the gold bullion. This price level would mean that BTC’s market cap would have to rise by around 4.5x from where it started in 2021 at roughly $575 billion. Bitcoin is trading at about $40,900 with a market cap of just over $760 billion at the time of writing.","Get access to the FT's daily newsletter with guided explanation of and links to the day's top stories written by FT editors.

After the ether token surged past the $1,000 mark on January 3, the average transaction fee on the network similarly soared to a new all-time high (ATH) of $17.41, some 24 hours later. Although the average fee has since retreated, data on January 8 shows that the latest average fee at $9.79. This figure still well above the $3.56 seen on the first day of the new year.

Resurgent ETH fees

Before the new ATH, the Ethereum network’s previous highest average fee of $12.54 was recorded on September 1, 2020. At that time, some crypto enthusiasts attributed this surge to the decentralized finance (defi) hype. However, as the defi mania began to dissipate, ETH transaction fees gradually dropped.

However, as recent data shows, the network’s transaction fees, which averaged less than $5 for much of Q4 of 2020, have now stayed above $9 for all but two days of January 2021. This return of high fees on the network comes more than a month after ETH’s migration to a proof of stake (POS) consensus mechanism.

Meanwhile, the latest data shows that at the current fee levels, it now costs the same or even less to transact on the BTC network than on the ETH network. To illustrate, in the period during which ETH fees surged to the new ATH, transaction fees on the BTC have remained within the same range. For instance, during the entire Q4 period, fees on the BTC network have only peaked at $13.41 on October 31.

For much of Q4 of 2020, the fees on the Bitcoin network have fluctuated between the October 31 high of $13.41 and $1.44 the lowest average in that period. Similarly, on the BCH network, whose crypto is up by more than 100% since October 1, fees remain less than $0.01 per transaction.

Upgrade to Fix Problem of High Fees

Meanwhile, Kamil Brejcha, Founder at Dexfin offers the possible reason why ETH fees have spiked and how ongoing updates will fix this. Brejcha explains:

“We face high ETH fees because the Ethereum network still relies on miners to be block producers. The current update is called the Beacon chain, which allows depositing Ethereum for staking nodes. These nodes run on their own blockchain, which is not yet part of the mainnet.”

The Dexfin founder also details the upgrading process which starts with the Beacon chain. In 2021, the next Shard chain will follow before the merging of the two in the year 2022 or later. After that, the “transaction speed should improve more, also cutting the gas fee.”

Retail investors in the U.K. and U.S. are barred from buying into crypto derivatives, including financial contracts that allow margin trading where investors need only put up a small amount of the contract’s notional payoff.

Customers of eToro in European countries that allow such trading in contracts for differences (CFDs), were told via email on the evening of Friday, Jan. 8: “If you do not increase the margin to 100%, then the position will be closed at 21:00 GMT today.”

This came with an explainer, saying clients with available balance could keep the positions open by adding funds, while those that don’t have available balances had the option to close other positions in order to free up funds.

However, disgruntled traders have taken to Twitter, stating that four hours later eToro closed all leveraged positions on cryptocurrencies, including those that users had attempted to keep open.

“eToro violated the contracts it had agreed with its clients,” said Slavko Vesenjak, an attorney in Slovenia who represents several eToro clients from across Europe. “A four-hour notice before closing all leveraged crypto positions made people wake up in their different time zones seeing their positions closed.”

Amy Butler, global head of PR for eToro, said the vast majority of eToro’s customers were unaffected by the changes.

“We understand that there are several dozen frustrated clients and we are working hard to resolve their frustrations,” Butler said.

Also last week, eToro, which is said to be planning a $5 billion public listing, raised its required deposit level from $200 to $1,000 in order to better manage overwhelming demand from hopeful crypto traders attracted by rocketing prices.

The temporary decision to increase deposit minimums is because of the surge in demand, said Butler. As far as the removal of leveraged crypto in Europe, this decision was taken “from an internal risk management perspective,” said Butler, adding that it was not related to any potential IPO plans.

“The eToro clients will get their funds. If eToro does not refund them, the Cyprus state will,” said Jurij Toplak, a law professor at Alma Mater Europaea in Slovenia and an adjunct at New York’s Fordham Law.

Toplak said aggrieved eToro customers he’s representing will be approaching the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission in a bid to have eToro’s license revoked.","What Would Sigmund Freud Do? Advice on Remote Work and Marriage Counseling During The Pandemic

@ michael-brooks Michael Brooks Founder & CEO of goLance and the author of REMOTE iT!, a new Amazon best seller in Outsourcing.

If you’re thinking about leaving the corporate world and becoming a freelancer, have you considered how that shift might impact your relationship with your wife, husband, or partner?

I’m all for it because I believe that freelancing equals the freedom to work from anywhere, do what you like, and set your own schedule. I could go on and on, but it might be helpful to look at this career change from the perspective of someone who can help you understand why it’s the right move and show you how to explain that to a loved one who needs convincing. So, I thought about what Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, would do in this situation.

Here’s an example of how one scenario would play out between George, a software developer, and his wife Nikita, who is a technical writer. George has been working for the same company for about 5 years, where he develops work productivity software. It’s a steady job with decent pay, but before COVID lockdowns George had to commute a total of 3 hours a day and usually worked more than 10+ hours from office. He still puts in the same working hours, minus the commute. George got passed over again for a promotion, his projects aren't very exciting, and his latest boss is a micromanager. George is burned out and wants to become a freelancer. Here’s how the conversation about freelancing went and where Sigmund Freud fits in.

George: Nikita, I’m ready for a change. This job is wearing me down and it’s so boring. I want to become a freelance game developer. You know how much I enjoy gaming. I want you to support me in this move.

Nikita: Are you crazy? We’re in the middle of a pandemic. This is no time to like what you’re doing. Just stick with your boring job and be grateful, even if it makes you a bit miserable.

George: I consider myself fortunate to have work, but I’m not happy. Seriously, the best thing that happened to me today, after waiting 30 minutes in line to get into the grocery store, I discovered they finally had toilet paper on the shelves again. I was able to grab the last few rolls on the shelf without a fight because I was six feet away from the closest shopper. Dealing with a dead-end job during this surreal time is really stressing me out.

Nikita: Maybe you should get some counseling. I have an app for that.

The next thing you know, Nikita sets up a Zoom call with a virtual therapist. To her surprise, Sigmund Freud shows up.

George: Hey, you look familiar….your clothes are a bit outdated, but I know I’ve seen you somewhere before.

Freud: I’m all over the Internet – something they invented after my time. So, let’s talk about your feelings and why you contacted me. Are you repressed? Frustrated?

Nikita: I’ll explain. George wants to quit his steady (although boring) job to follow his dream of becoming a freelance software game developer. I think it’s way too risky.

Freud: Hmm…Dreams. I’m so into dreams. I even wrote a book about dreams and the subconscious mind.

George: It’s more like a goal I’ve always had. I never really dreamt about it.

Freud: Okay. So, I don’t know much about the types of jobs that have appeared in the last 80 years, but it’s a worthwhile idea to pursue something that will make you happy. That’s where the idea takes over and you can focus on pleasure. I could go on about that forever, but I won’t.

Nikita: But we also need money and stability. How can he give up that steady paycheck?

George: I’ll do fine. I plan to earn more money and find work through an online freelance marketplace that pays me. I can work on new projects that will be challenging and exciting. I’ll even be able to set my own hours. And there’s no commute because I can do my work remotely from anywhere. That’s not the case with my current job. Once we get through this pandemic, they said I’d have to go back to the office again.

Freud: You’re right. This whole period brings me back to the days before the Spanish Flu hit. I hated schlepping around in a horse and buggy on my way to work. So, not having to commute is a real privilege, not to mention the other benefits you discussed. It actually sounds great to me.

George: Well, Nikita’s not thrilled about the idea.

Freud: Nikita, can I help you explore George’s situation even further so that you can look at this from his perspective?

Nikita: Actually, it’s all starting to make sense. No commute, a flexible schedule, new projects, and the potential to make more money. Maybe I’ll even consider freelancing myself.

George: Wow. That’s a great idea.

Freud: And I didn’t even need to hypnotize her to come up with that conclusion. I would say this has been a very successful session.

Bitcoin slid as much as 21% over Sunday and Monday, its biggest two-day decline since March, under pressure from investor risk aversion that also undermined equities while the dollar rallied.

The possibility of a second impeachment for President Donald Trump encouraged safe-haven flows into the dollar, which rose to two-week highs.

Bitcoin is still up roughly 89% over the past month.

Cryptocurrencies tumbled on Monday, wiping off nearly $140 billion in total market cap, as traders took profits on the spectacular rally so far this month in light of a stronger dollar and growing political uncertainty.

Investors will be keeping a close eye on a possible impeachment of President Donald Trump and a surge in COVID-19 cases in Asia.

Bitcoin plunged as much as 21% over Sunday and Monday, its biggest two-day decline since March, though the cryptocurrency is still up roughly 89% on a trailing one-month basis. Ethereum fell 12%. The smaller coins XRP and Litecoin shed about 18% each.

The fall in cryptocurrencies on Monday wiped nearly $140 billion off the entire market. Last week, the overall cryptocurrency market rose above $1 trillion for the first time.

Bitcoin last week hit a record high above $41,000, swept up by the combination of a weaker dollar, economic optimism, and a wave of bullish sentiment toward cryptocurrencies as big-name investors and investment banks touted a potential for huge gains this year.

Political uncertainty has mounted, knocking investor risk appetite for assets such as stocks and commodities. House Democrats have said they're prepared to impeach Trump again after he encouraged a right-wing mob that stormed the Capitol building last week.

""The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to colleagues on Sunday.

Strategists at Rabobank said in a note that ""the stronger dollar and higher bond yields has also sparked a plunge in Bitcoin and in gold prices this morning.""

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, similar to many commodities, tend to do the opposite of whatever the dollar is doing.

The correlation between Bitcoin and the dollar index was at -0.95, meaning the two are more likely to move inversely. Correlation is measured between 1.0 and -1.0, with the former signifying that the two assets are prone to moving in perfect tandem.

The dollar was up 0.4% against a basket of major currencies, trading at its strongest in almost two weeks after plumbing 33-month lows last week.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, fell 11.4% on the Bitfinex exchange, where trading volume was the largest, according to Bloomberg data. The price held at about $1,128, within sight of last week's three-year high of about $1,350.

However, analysts said the retreat was likely to be temporary, given the growing number of buyers and owners of cryptocurrencies.

""Some of the anarchy froth supporting Bitcoin after anti-government types stormed Capitol Hill is receding a touch. But the reason to stay long coins on the new age technology impulse and all that is associated with blockchain technology hasn't changed much,"" said Stephen Innes, the chief market strategist at Axi.

One casualty of the recent rally in Bitcoin prices has been operations at cryptocurrency exchanges.

Users at North America's biggest cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase experienced ""connectivity issues"" even as Bitcoin crossed the $40,000 mark Thursday. After approximately four hours, the company's support team tweeted that the supposed issues had been resolved.

Key Takeaways Crypto exchanges in the United States reported connectivity issues due to demand after Bitcoin price crossed $40,000.

Most crypto exchanges have reported operational and connection problems after Bitcoin price skyrockets.

Kraken, another major cryptocurrency exchange, also suffered exchange connection issues due to ""heavy loads."" The exchange was back up after three hours. Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, had reported an outage last year when Bitcoin price crossed $20,000.

A Recurring Problem

Disruptions of operations have become a regular feature at Coinbase after Bitcoin price gyrations multiply. The exchange went down after a sharp selloff in cryptocurrency markets during the Bitcoin rally of 2017. As Bitcoin price gathered momentum last year, Coinbase suffered multiple outages. Along with its retail-focused app, the exchange has also reported past issues for its Coinbase Pro offering aimed at institutional investors.

With more users than Charles Schwab, the San Francisco-based company is among the biggest cryptocurrency trading platforms in the world, and downtime there could have a significant effect on trading volumes for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's price has skyrocketed in recent times due to a combination of global macroeconomic instability and institutional interest, leading to an influx of retail investors.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has chalked downtime problems at his exchange to ""scaling issues."" Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong previously tweeted that the company was investing in additional servers and customer support to ensure that that it could handle increased traffic loads in the future.

That should be good news for investors because the company has filed to go public. The markets will not take kindly to operational problems as Bitcoin price rises due to consumer and institutional demand.","Bitcoin's first big pullback of the year is hurting cryptocurrency miners on Monday.

Shares of Riot Blockchain and Marathon Patent Group have fallen over 15% on the back of Bitcoin's pullback.

Bitcoin mining is now more popular, and more difficult, than ever before according to data from CoinDesk.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Shares of Cryptocurrency miners Riot Blockchain and Marathon Patent Group are taking the brunt of bitcoin's fall on Monday.

Both stocks are down over 15% following bitcoin's tumble from over $40,000 to under $33,000 per coin. The slide wiped some $170 billion off of total cryptocurrency market value in just a few days.

As of Monday morning, the decline is the largest drop for cryptocurrencies since their historic run began back in October.

The bitcoin sell-off comes after months of gains for cryptocurrencies and may signal some profit-taking, according to Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading at cryptocurrency financial services firm Babel Finance.

Chen said in a statement, ""the correction we saw was expected as we believe the BTC price surge recently from under $20,000 to $40,000 in the past four weeks will induce sell pressure,"" per CNBC.

However, according to the Bitcoin bulls, there's still room for the cryptocurrency to run.

""It's probably going to $100,000, then $150,000, then $200,000,"" Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya argued on CNBC's ""Halftime Report last Friday.

Others, including economist David Rosenberg, argue Bitcoin is nothing more than a ""massive bubble"" that investors just don't understand.

Bubble or not, Bitcoin miners saw unprecedented gains in recent months.

Shares of Riot Blockchain went from trading at under $10 per share in early December to around $22 per share on Monday. And shares of Marathon Patent Group traded at under $5 per share in early December vs. over $21 per share as of Monday morning.

The rapid price appreciation among crypto miners came on the back of mining revenue tripling in recent months.

Unfortunately for public Bitcoin miners, the crypto gold rush also brought new competition to the industry, making mining for bitcoin more difficult, and data from Coindesk shows cryptocurrency mining is more popular and harder than ever before.

This has also put a strain on hardware suppliers in the industry, according to Edward Evenson, business development lead at Braiins, a mining software company.

""ASIC manufacturers have had to turn away more than half a billion dollars in mining equipment orders in Q4 2020 alone. Hardware supply chains are currently overloaded by immense demand,"" Evenson said.

The good news for Riot Blockchain and Marathon Patent Group shareholders is the companies have already placed pre-orders for 31,000 and 90,000 crypt mining machines, respectively, through 2020.

Still, if Bitcoin prices don't stabilize, these highly correlated stocks could continue their fall in 2021.","The recent euphoria in cryptocurrencies morphed into a severe sell-off, as bitcoin (BTC) prices dove 12% on Monday, which would be the most for a single calendar day since March.

Prices for the largest cryptocurrency had soared last week to an all-time high of $41,962, and that level was apparently sufficient to prompt some cryptocurrency miners to take profits. Declines were broad-based across digital-asset markets, with ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and cardano (ADA) suffering declines in the double-digit percentages.

“Time to take some money off the table,” Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of the Wall Street firm Guggenheim, tweeted early Monday. In December, Minerd predicted bitcoin prices should be worth $400,000. “Bitcoin’s parabolic rise is unsustainable in the near term.”

Yves Renno, head of trading at Wirex, told First Mover in emailed comments that he “would expect a period of very high volatility.”

The retreat in cryptocurrencies came as investors in traditional markets also turned more cautious, amid speculation over how the final days of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tumultuous four-year term might play out. Asian and European shares slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open. The U.S. dollar rose against major currencies and gold strengthened 0.1% to $1,850 an ounce.

Market moves

The long arm of U.S. regulation and law enforcement might have limited reach when it comes to global cryptocurrency markets.

That could be one takeaway from the recent trading action in the digital token XRP, which until recently was the third-biggest virtual asset after bitcoin and Ethereum’s ether.

Prices for XRP plunged 67% in December after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the San Francisco-based payment-technology company Ripple Labs of violating federal laws when selling $1.3 billion of the tokens over a seven-year period.

Yet, some traders apparently believe the XRP tokens now represent an attractive value, reports CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen. On Sunday, they changed hands at about 28 cents, up some 30% year to date.

Simons Chen, a crypto trader based in Hong Kong, told Shen he bought XRP as prices bottomed out in December, seeing a great opportunity to “buy the dip,” in Wall Street parlance.

The SEC’s suit has prompted cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase, Bitstamp, OKCoin and Bittrex to delist or suspend trading in XRP.

But far from entering a death spiral, the XRP market has shown surprising resilience, especially when three of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges – Binance, Huobi and OKEx, all with roots in China – have continued to maintain pairings with the digital asset, Shen reported. There’s been significant traffic in trades between XRP and the Korean won, as well as with tether (USDT), a dollar-linked stablecoin that’s popular with Chinese traders.

“Unlike Coinbase or other ‘regulated’ exchanges, Korean and [other] Asian exchanges do not need to care that much of what the SEC does, and investors in Asia are less sensitive about the news,” said Sinhae Lee, partner at Shanghai-based blockchain consulting firm Block72.

The total market capitalization of XRP tokens currently stands at about $28 billion. That’s a little shy of the automaker Ford Motor Co.’s $35 billion stock market value and a little more than the U.S. bank and money manager State Street Corp.’s $27 billion.

“No one really knows what’s going to happen to it,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the crypto prime broker Bequant, said last week in interview. “It’s still holding onto a decent market cap for a company that’s supposed to be on its knees.”

Bitcoin fell sharply early on Monday, after failing to establish a foothold above $40,000 over the weekend.

Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency declined by more than $8,000 to $32,400, a drop of more than 20% from levels above $40,800 late Sunday.

“Hefty spot selling against an over-levered market caused the price drop,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk, adding that it is unclear whether it was miner selling or macro traders liquidating positions.

Data provided by South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant suggests miner selling did contribute to the price drop.

The 30-day average of Miners’ Position Index – a gauge of how rapidly bitcoin miners are moving to liquidate inventories on cryptocurrency exchanges – rose to 2.20 on Sunday, the highest level since July 2019. A reading above 2.00 indicates miners are selling.

The index “looks enough to make a local top,” CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju tweeted Sunday. “They’re selling bitcoin.”

People could ""lose all their money"" if they invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the UK's financial watchdog said on Monday.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high of almost $42,000 on Friday but has since fallen to about $35,000.

Regulators are increasingly concerned about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and are paying more attention to digital assets.

People who invest in cryptocurrencies could well ""lose all their money,"" the UK's financial regulator said on Monday as the volatile price of Bitcoin slid from an all-time high of almost $42,000.

Bitcoin's startling rise of more than 300% over the past year has captured the attention of the public and institutional investors alike. But the cryptocurrency is highly volatile; from Friday to Monday, it dropped by about 15%, from a record high of about $41,800 to $34,645.

The cryptocurrency mania has also attracted the watchful eyes of financial regulators across the world. They worry that amateur investors could be sucked in only for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to collapse in value, as Bitcoin did in 2018.

Britain's Financial Conduct Authority put it starkly in a statement: ""If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money.""

The watchdog said it was worried by some firms offering investments in or products linked to cryptocurrencies as they seek to capitalize on the rally.

""Significant price volatility in cryptoassets, combined with the inherent difficulties of valuing cryptoassets reliably, places consumers at a high risk of losses,"" it said.

It added that ""the complexity of some products and services relating to cryptoassets can make it hard for consumers to understand the risks.""

""There is no guarantee that cryptoassets can be converted back into cash. Converting a cryptoasset back to cash depends on demand and supply existing in the market.""

Memories of the collapse in Bitcoin's price from late 2017 to early 2019 - when it dropped from almost $20,000 to below $4,000 - are weighing on regulators.

The FCA also stressed that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are largely unregulated. It said investors would be unlikely to have recourse as compensation or complaints ""if something goes wrong.""

Regulators are attempting to tighten rules about cryptocurrencies. Since Sunday, the FCA has required all UK cryptocurrency firms to register with it, as part of regulations designed to tackle money laundering.

The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in December floated the idea that companies could be required to collect information on the holders of cryptocurrency wallets.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who also runs the payments company Square, is among the critics of the idea, suggesting the unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies is one of the main attractions of the market.

Mark Cuban compared the recent volatility in cryptocurrency trading volatility to the 1990s dot-com bubble, predicting that bitcoin, ethereum and ""a few others"" would be equivalent to the tech giants who survived that bubble.

Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, also advised crypto investors to hold and hedge the alternative digital currencies while comparing them to Amazon.com (AMZN) - Get Report, eBay (EBAY) - Get Report and Priceline.

""Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble,"" Cuban wrote in a tweet. ""EXACTLY. I think btc, eth , a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dot-com era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’t""

Last week, Cuban told his Twitter followers that he would run for president if bitcoin reached a price of $1 million with the promise that his administration would be able to donate 350 bitcoin to the Treasury each year of his expected term. The Treasury would then have to hold the coins for 10 years.

Last week, the total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies rose above $1 trillion as bitcoin led a dramatic jump in valuation.

On Sunday and Monday, however, bitcoin posted its worst two-day drop since March, sliding as much as 21% as investors moved to perceived safe-haven assets - in this case not bitcoin.

Bitcoin hit a record high of nearly $42,000 on Friday on continued interest in the digital currency as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to the falling dollar. The price of bitcoin has more than quadrupled in the past 12 months.

However, stocks fell on Monday as investors recalibrated their strategies amid expectations that proceedings to impeach current President Donald Trump will move forward, and as a surge in coronavirus infections continued to pummel the U.S.

Approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the US could pull investors out of a popular trade and erode a key support of the cryptocurrency's lofty price, JPMorgan strategists said Friday.

Institutional investors largely invest in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust for regulatory reasons instead of directly buying bitcoin. But the trust touts a premium to the underlying token.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to authorize a bitcoin ETF in 2021. The introduction of such a fund could drive institutional investors out of Grayscale's trust and cut into the premium.

While outflows from Grayscale's trust could present a near-term pressure for bitcoin prices, JPMorgan still expects bitcoin ETFs to benefit the cryptocurrency in the longer term.

The introduction of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the US is likely to pull investors out of a popular buying option and create a near-term drag on the token's price, JPMorgan said Friday.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve such an ETF this year as the Biden administration brings new leadership to the agency. Regulatory authorization would strengthen bitcoin's investment case in the long term. But more immediately, approval would likely sap investor capital from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, according to JPMorgan.

While retail investors typically buy bitcoin directly, institutional investors largely purchase stakes in Grayscale's trust for regulatory reasons, according to the strategists. The fund effectively holds a monopoly on institutional capital flowing into bitcoin and therefore boasts a large premium to the cryptocurrency it tracks.

A bitcoin ETF would offer an alternative to the Grayscale trust and cut into the premiums that funds pay, the team said.

""A cascade of GBTC outflows and a collapse of its premium would likely have negative near-term implications for bitcoin given the flow and signaling important of GBTC,"" the bank said in a note to clients.

Bitcoin cooled to start the week after soaring to nearly $42,000 on Friday. The cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 19%, to $30,775.26, on Monday as investors secured profits from its weeks-long rally. Bitcoin still sits roughly 90% higher over the past month.

JPMorgan didn't estimate just how much an ETF could slam bitcoin, but the purchase structures used by institutional investors provide some hints. A typical trade for monetizing the Grayscale trust's premium involves borrowing bitcoin, placing the tokens in the trust, and receiving shares with a six-month lockup period. Investors then hedge the stake by shorting GBTC shares.

Read more: BANK OF AMERICA: Buy these 10 Dow stocks to take advantage of rich dividends and a long-term strategy primed for a comeback in 2021

Some institutional investors likely entered the monetization trade during the second half of 2020 with the intention of selling after the lockup period, JPMorgan said. The strategists estimated that roughly 15% of GBTC shares were being used for the monetization trade. Once the six-month lockup expires, a significant portion of the trust's investors could rush for the exits to pocket the premium.

A bitcoin ETF would only intensify the exodus, the bank added. Such a fund would erode Grayscale's monopoly status and could prompt more investors to leave the trust.

Bitcoin traded at $33,625.67 as of 8:48 a.m. ET on Monday.

Your pocketbook may soon be going virtual.

That is, if the trend in cryptocurrency continues. This non-physical, digital form of money — issued not by governments but by private systems — keeps multiplying. Since 2009, when bitcoin — the first and best-known — debuted, thousands of cryptocurrencies have become available. Cryptocurrencies have been championed and developed by several corporations and financial institutions, including Air Asia, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and Facebook.

And the currencies have also attracted the attention of the financial world. The rapid ups and downs in the prices of bitcoin and the 12 other major types that can be traded are the stuff of daily headlines.

S&P Dow Jones Indices, which runs the S&P 500 Index, is going to start publishing the price moves of several cryptocurrencies in 2021, helping investors track the performance of different coins. This sort of index gives a major boost of transparency and legitimacy to ""crypto"" as an asset class.

For all its fame, though, ""crypto"" can still be confusing. Here's a guide to the basics behind the electronic currency — how it works, and what to know before investing in it.

What is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is often referred to as ""decentralized money,"" meaning that it is stored, created, and processed outside of a central bank, or government.

Unlike traditional ""hard"" or paper money, cryptocurrency has no physical form. It's really a set of data, secured by cryptography (the science of encoding and decoding information) — that's why it's called ""cryptocurrency.""

When data is encoded, the information is converted from one form to another, less discernible form, and is then decoded — or reverted — back to its original form by the end-user. This complex process eliminates the possibilities of double spending and counterfeiting, thus reinforcing the security of using cryptocurrency to pay for things.

In a way, cryptocurrency works like a secure, cloud-based filing system, much like Dropbox or Google Drive .

By decentralizing, cryptocurrency avoids interactions with third-party servers and government agencies, which often engage in mass data collection and allow potential control of an individual's access to funds. This lack of affiliation with a government or banking system allows transactions to be processed anonymously, which some users consider a notable benefit.

On the flipside, cryptocurrencies lack one of the main advantages of a physical or ""hard"" money system, since there is no government entity responsible for maintaining the central supply, or even a record of the money or its transactions.

How does cryptocurrency work?

Cryptocurrencies maintain their own record-keeping through the use of blockchain, an online ledger and transaction log.

Blockchains create digital records — of transactions, certificates, or contracts —that can only be added to, rather than changed or deleted. This independent transaction log, crypto-converts insist, is far more secure than paper records or institutional digital accounts, which could be hacked.

Essentially, the platform archives both the buyer's and seller's information and records it as a ""hash,"" or string of letters and numbers generated by a complex mathematical function. Each hash is directly linked to the hash before it, so unauthorized changes to the ledger will become apparent immediately after a hash is altered.

Once a certain number of hashes is reached, the group is converted into a ""block"" and linked to the other blocks on the server — hence the name ""blockchain."" The blockchain is updated every ten minutes and stored on a multitude of servers worldwide.

Cryptocurrencies operate in a closed system, meaning that there is a fixed amount of them and new units can only be created following a strict set of guidelines. Some currencies, such as bitcoin, have a software-enforced cap on how many units can be created. This limited supply makes each unit more valuable—especially as the currency gains popularity among day traders.

Most popular cryptocurrencies

Several varieties of cryptocurrencies exist. The most popular and widely traded include:

Bitcoin (BTC): Both the first and by far the most popular crypto, Bitcoin was created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who described it as a ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system."" The first use of bitcoin occurred in 2010 when a user traded 10,000 bitcoin for two pizzas — an amount that, at the currency's current prices, would now be worth over $100 million. Since being established, Bitcoin has also splintered off into several Bitcoin-based products, including Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

What is cryptocurrency used for?

In its early days, crypto seemed a tad shady, associated with criminals and money launderers. A black market operation, the Silk Road, used bitcoin as its currency of choice until the FBI shut it down in 2013.

Since then, cryptocurrency has slowly gained prominence in the public eye — and respectability. Today, it can be used for a variety of transactions, including investing in startups, negotiating import-export contracts, and even paying utility bills.

In 2020, Paypal announced that it would allow users to hold multiple types of cryptocurrencies on their accounts, and is even looking to allow crypto to be used as a payment option on their many partner websites like eBay.

But while its uses are growing, cryptocurrencies mainly seem to flourish as an investment asset, trading in specialized currency markets.

How to invest in cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency can form part of a well-balanced portfolio. Unlike traditional stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, crypto offers the security of anonymity and the potential for rapid future growth. In addition, because it operates outside of a traditional government setting, the assets are typically not subject to a freeze or seizure by authorities.

Common investing apps like Robinhood, Coinbase, and Kraken all offer the ability to purchase crypto with ease. There are also entire online trading platforms and exchanges (like Gemini, BlockFi, eToro, and Bitcoin IRA) dedicated exclusively to crypto products.

Additionally, publicly traded Bitcoin trusts and funds allow individuals to invest in professionally managed portfolios that trade the currencies — offering the diversification and economical prices that regular mutual funds and ETFs do.

What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency poses three major risks:

It operates entirely without government oversight. The fact that crypto and its marketplaces are private and unregulated has raised questions as to what types of taxes are paid on gains or losses of the asset, as well as its potential for abuse. For example, in 2014, Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange platform Mt. Gox was hacked, resulting in the loss of over 700,000 BTC. It doesn't physically exist. Some compare crypto to blinker light fluid — it's not a real thing. It's not a tangible asset, like gold or other commodities. It doesn't represent a piece of a company, like a stock or bond. Crypto is not printed or minted like other currencies. So it has no fundamental value — only its trading value, which makes it highly speculative. It is volatile. Crypto prices swing dramatically, sometimes plunging or climbing by hundreds of dollars in hours. In 2013, bitcoin plunged from $1,000 to $300 per unit; in November 2020 bitcoin crashed $3,000, then climbed to a new all-time high of $23,770.85 on Dec. 17. Other currencies trade in the mere hundreds, but their moves can be just as extreme.

Innovations are already being established to manage the market fluctuation of the system and control its valuation. For example, the crypto coin Tether quite literally ""tethers"" itself to local currencies, thus sidestepping the characteristic volatility of other unsecured tokens.

The financial takeaway

Cryptocurrency is an emerging asset that is sure to continue evolving in the coming years. Whether the future will be one where all tokens are backed by local currency or whether they'll remain intangible, crypto can certainly form a portion of a prudent investor's portfolio.

Its decentralized nature has protected cryptocurrency from the influence of third-party servers and government agencies, which has created an anonymous processing system that appeals to many users. Its blockchain technology maintains a complex and highly-secure transaction log.

However, the system is not risk-free by any means. The current lack of government and international regulations may hinder the product's desirability for some. For others, the volatility of different coin prices may seem just too dangerous — especially for an asset that has no intrinsic, fundamental value.

Much like the asset's price, public perception of cryptocurrency has fluctuated dramatically over time. But it's safe to say that this new type of currency is not yet spent.

Market moves

A high price does not a market make. But guess what does? High trading volume.

One of the important things to note about the bitcoin market during this year’s rally is the record amount of cryptocurrency changing hands. That was true of the rapid ascent to new all-time highs above $40,000, and it’s also been true on the way down.

What it means is the market is staying liquid, seen as a healthy attribute especially when prices are on the move. You might be a buyer at what might seem like nosebleed levels, but you’re not the only one.

As reported Monday by CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen, trading volumes and active addresses for bitcoin have now surpassed their previous all-time highs during the last crypto bull run of 2017.

“This is first and foremost a sign of how much bigger and mature the industry is, with a lot more money flowing on these exchanges,” Bendik Norheim Schei, head of research at the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research, told CoinDesk. “It is great to see higher volumes, making the market more liquid and efficient.”

The surging volume due to Monday’s sell-off came in part from newcomers to the market, according to Schei.

“Some of this volume is definitely from new and unexperienced investors entering the market for the first time and panicking when the price starts falling,” he told Shen. “These corrections are necessary and healthy, even in a bull market.”

And those newcomers aren’t necessarily rubes. They might even be sophisticated Wall Street players who have only recently dipped their toes into crypto – a sign of bitcoin’s increasing adoption by big institutional investors as a way of betting on the currency debasement amid trillions of dollars of central bank money printing.

“The retail-driven spot market, which was pretty much the entire market three years ago, is now part of a much more mature and diverse marketplace that includes derivatives, investment funds and other institutional involvement.” Sui Chung, chief executive of CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk.

(For what it’s worth, healthy liquidity is considered such a crucial component of any market that last year the Federal Reserve cited “smooth” functioning of Wall Street’s plumbing as a rationale for continuing its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, a form of monetary stimulus that was previously considered an emergency measure but is increasingly seen as normal.)

Alongside the flurry of activity on cryptocurrency exchanges, there has also been robust traffic in bitcoin derivatives – financial contracts such as futures, options and “perpetual swaps” traders can use to bet on the cryptocurrency’s price.

The Chicago-based CME said Monday its notional bitcoin futures volume climbed to a monthly record of $30 billion in December, exceeding the then-record $20 billion traded in November. The exchange launched its bitcoin futures contract in January 2018.

At least one industry executive says futures markets might become more critical as more investors hoard their cryptocurrency holdings while waiting for prices to go up.

“With ‘physical’ bitcoin disappearing, the volumes of derivative contracts are soaring,” said Richard Byworth, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange firm Diginex, which last week launched its own “bitcoin perpetual futures contract.”

There’s high risk, too: The market was apparently liquid enough that some $410 million of long positions in bitcoin futures (bets on further price gains) were wiped out Monday after margin calls on the Binance exchange, according to the data firm Glassnode in a tweet.

All of this just makes it more likely that the bitcoin market is reflecting the wealth of opinions on where prices should be at any given time for a blockchain-based, 12-year-old, peer-to-peer electronic payment system with a fixed issuance schedule that is now seen as a hedge against potential debasement of the U.S. dollar.

Simon Peters, of the trading platform, eToro, wrote Monday that “we can look to the $70,000-$90,000 range as a price target for the end of 2021.” Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter bitcoin trader, told CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey the latest sell-off might be “just be a bump in the massive bull run – $100,000 this year is totally possible!”

Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, says there’s a “good deal of open options interest at the $52,000 price level.”

With trading volumes growing, it’s getting easier to place those bets, whether right or wrong.

Despite bitcoin’s 20% crash on Monday, some options traders are betting on a continued price rally in coming weeks.

Some 4,000 call option contracts have been bought at the $52,000 strike in the past 24 hours, according to data from the Swiss-based data analytics platform Laevitas. The $64,000 and $72,000 strike call options show buying volume of 3,250 and 2,000, respectively.

The call options carry an expiration date of Jan. 29, so they represent a gamble that bitcoin could prices could rise above that level in the next few weeks.

These deep out-of-the-money trades are relatively cheap and tend to gain significant value if the price rally materializes, yielding big returns on small investments. As such, seasoned traders with bullish price expectations often buy call options at higher strike prices, on the chance that they might pay out. So the fact that traders are actually using them could indicate bullish market sentiment.

In another indicator from the options market, the one-, three- and six-month put-call “skews,” which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, remain entrenched in the negative territory. That’s a sign of call options, or bullish bets, drawing higher demand than puts, which are bearish.

Tweet of the day","Cryptocurrency prices may be on a tear, and Bitcoin (BTCUSD) may have found favor with institutional investors, but the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) still isn't convinced that cryptoassets are a safe investment.

The agency, which oversees financial markets in the United Kingdom, has warned consumers that ""they should be prepared to lose all their money"" if they invest in cryptocurrencies or in investments linked to them. ""Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors' money,"" the FCA wrote on its website.

Key Takeaways The U.K.'s financial regulator has warned consumers that they could lose all their money and outlined five risks associated with cryptocurrency investing.

The regulator has asked consumers to check for registration of crypto trading firms before putting money into crypto assets.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have set new records in the past month amid renewed attention and positive statements about their potential from institutional investors. According to some reports, retail investors have also begun investing in cryptocurrencies to profit from the rally.

The Risks of Cryptocurrency Investing

The FCA outlined five risks for investment in cryptocurrencies for consumers. First, the unregulated status of cryptocurrencies means that consumers may not be adequately protected against investors advertising high returns for the asset class. Second, the price volatility of cryptocurrencies places consumers at a high risk for losses. Third, the technical underpinnings of cryptocurrencies make concepts and risks relating to investing in them difficult to understand for lay consumers. ""There is no guarantee that cryptoassets can be converted back into cash,"" the agency stated.

The FCA also warned investors against possibly high charges and fees associated with crypto investing. According to the agency, this is primarily due to the absence of regulation for cryptocurrencies. Finally, the agency cautioned investors against the returns of investment returns of crypto products. ""Firms … may understate the risks involved,"" the agency stated.

This is not the first time that the agency has issued warnings against cryptocurrencies. During the previous bull run in 2017, the FCA came out strongly against initial coin offerings (ICOs) and online trading scams involving cryptocurrencies. ""ICOs are very high-risk, speculative investments,"" the agency stated. ""You should be conscious of the risks involved … and prepared to lose your entire stake."" It also urged banks to monitor and take strict action against their clients involved in crypto activities.

A Question of Regulation

The agency's warnings of the risks involved in cryptocurrencies are a reminder of the inherent instability of crypto markets despite improvements in infrastructure and liquidity. Laith Khalaf, a financial analyst with AJ Bell, stated that the regulator's actions were the result of concerns that ""the high risks already inherent in cryptoassets are being compounded by scam activity, as well as unregulated firms targeting consumers with marketing material that highlights the rewards, but not the potential downside, of investing in cryptoassets.""

Crypto markets are thinly traded, and cryptocurrency prices still witness wild price swings, often skyrocketing and crashing in double-digit values in a single day. And despite the hesitant vote of confidence from investors, the absence of proper regulation still strikes a discordant note in the emerging ecosystem.

The FCA has asked investors to check if the crypto investment firm they are dealing with is registered with them. (The agency established a temporary registration regime in December last year for crypto trading firms.) ""If they're not, the FCA suggests that consumers should withdraw their cryptoassets and/or money,"" the agency wrote on its website.","January 12, 2021 2 min read

Investing in an asset as volatile as the cryptocurrency market is always a risk. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warned electronic currency investors that they are in danger of losing all their money. According to analysts, investment risks are compounded by scam activity .

The last few days have been dizzying for cryptic coins. Yesterday, January 12, Bitcoin depreciated about 20% , falling below $ 30,000, after marking a record high of more than $ 40,000 per unit .

In this framework, British specialists point out that investments and loan products related to cryptocurrencies carry “very high risks” .

""If consumers invest in these types of products, they must be prepared to lose all their money,"" warned the FCA.

The body noted that cryptocurrencies are ""high-risk speculative investments"" and that those who buy them must be sure to understand ""what they are investing in, the risks associated with the investment and any regulatory protections that apply .""

For his part, financial analyst Laith Jalaf agrees that the sudden growth of Bitcoin could be a market bubble.

“The regulator is clearly concerned that the high risks already inherent in crypto assets are being compounded by scam activity, as well as unregulated companies targeting consumers with marketing collateral that highlights the rewards, but not the potential. disadvantage of investing in crypto assets ” , explained Jalaf in statements collected by the CNBC channel.

Bitcoin vs. Gold

On the other side are those who predict a promising future for cryptocurrencies. Analysts at JPMorgan said that Bitcoin could rise to $ 146,000 and compete with gold as an ""alternative"" currency. However, they add that it will only happen if the cryptocurrency's market capitalization increases 4.6 times to match the private sector's investment in gold of $ 2.7 trillion.

At the beginning of 2020, Bitcoin had an average price of $ 7,300 and closed the year at more than $ 29,000. That means an approximate growth of 300% in the last 12 months. As of early December alone, the cryptocurrency was worth about $ 19,000, representing a 53% increase in one month. Then, on January 7, it hit its all-time high of 40,000, dropping to 30,000 just a few days later. For now, it remains fairly stable, oscillating between 32 thousand and 36 thousand dollars per unit.","Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- For investment firms that profit by buying the debt of troubled companies, it looked like the opportunity of a lifetime: a $1 trillion pile of distressed bonds and loans in the Americas alone as the pandemic sent markets into meltdown last March.But after a massive federal bailout and rock-bottom interest rates kept even some of the shakiest companies afloat, those juicy targets have shriveled to less than $100 billion. That’s left distressed-debt specialists -- who at one point last year had $131 billion to spend -- rummaging for increasingly elusive bargains. Even the real estate sector, which was hammered after the pandemic shuttered offices, hotels and stores, has managed for now to avoid an epic wipeout.So, how are distressed-debt investors -- often among of the savviest in the markets -- deploying all that cash? A few, like Caspian Capital, decided to return some money to investors because the rewards wouldn’t justify the high risks anymore.Others are looking farther afield. Olympus Peak Asset Management is dipping into things like unpaid vendor claims in firms that are already bankrupt. Arena Investors is picking through convertible bonds and real estate loans cast off by banks. And giants of the business like Oaktree Capital Management are rustling around in Asia for opportunities.“People aren’t investing, they’re just chasing,” said Adam Cohen, Caspian’s managing partner. And this comes with an extra helping of risk, according to Oaktree co-founder Howard Marks, the dean of distressed investing. “To get to higher returns these days, you have to be willing to extend credit to somebody who is not clearly coming back,” Marks said in a Bloomberg TV interview.The money nevertheless continues to roll in, and managers have made some progress at finding new places to put it. About 40 funds -- from Oaktree to Angelo Gordon & Co. -- collected about $35 billion between this year and last, according to consultants at Preqin.For Arena Investors, a $2.2 billion investment firm, going smaller and nimble has had its advantages, said Chief Executive Officer Dan Zwirn. That’s because 80% of distressed companies in early April had less than $1 billion of debt outstanding, and about 60% of the companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year owed less than $500 million. That’s left too many larger firms chasing the few big situations that are left.“When you’re writing checks above $100 million, the level of competition is excessive,” Zwirn said.Arena deployed almost all of the $519 million it raised for a special opportunities strategy last year, targeting industries dislocated by the pandemic. Among the things they’ve been active in: real estate loans, special-situation lending in energy and aviation and litigation finance.Tighter LendingFund managers like Olympus Peak are also looking at companies that are too small to tap into the seemingly limitless bond and equity markets, which were supercharged last year by the unprecedented wave of federal stimulus.Large public-market borrowers have been mostly picked over by now. Smaller companies, on the other hand, have relied more on banks for liquidity. And the percentage of banks making it tougher to get a loan is still high at 11.4%, according to the Federal Reserve, well above the 1.9% average since the great financial crisis.“If you can only do public-market distress, you just have to hold your position, because if you sell it, there’s nothing else to buy,” said Jason Dillow, chief executive officer at the $8.4 billion Bardin Hill Investment Partners.Biggest Distressed/Special Situations Funds of 2020-2021Either way, distressed fund managers are trying a variety of tactics to drum up returns, according to people familiar with the portfolios:Bardin Hill raised $600 million for privately negotiated credit in early February and deployed about 78% of it. The cash went into high-end cruise lines, fitness, technology, health care and education, along with alternative assets such as insurance-backed claims.Olympus Peak, which runs a $1.4 billion hedge fund, started a $300 million fund this month focused on vendor claims that arise out of bankruptcies. So-called trade claims are often small, illiquid and labor-intensive, and thus less attractive for a larger fund.Angelo Gordon collected $3.5 billion at the beginning of the pandemic and invested all of it, plus $1 billion in recycled capital. It favored privately negotiated financings with high yields and strong protections for its investment written into its agreements.Centerbridge Partners’ Special Credit III strategy invested $1.8 billion in March and April of 2020. It has since traded out of 90% of those positions. The cash was redeployed into growth companies such as HCI Group Inc. and rescue financing for businesses such as cinema chains, including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., its U.K. subsidiary Odeon, and Cineworld Group Plc.As of February, Monarch Alternative Capital had invested more than 60% of the $3 billion it raised last year for its latest distressed credit fund. The firm lent to bankrupt businesses after the pandemic shut them down temporarily. The roster included a franchisee for Wendy’s and Pizza Hut, Ann Taylor’s parent company Ascena Retail Group, and the owner of Chuck E. Cheese, with Monarch looking beyond the pandemic and at times boosting its investment to keep the companies afloat.D.E. Shaw & Co. raised $1 billion for its latest private credit fund that targets stressed assets and financings with a 5-year investment window, the firm said Tuesday.For Cohen’s $3.5 billion Caspian Capital, distressed-debt investing is too narrow a mandate in today’s world, so the firm broadened into firms that are merely stressed. It’s looking for 10% to 15% yields, or credits that trade between 70 and 90 cents on the dollar but aren’t in default.Even with that wider purview, Caspian decided to close its $500 million dislocation strategy fund after cashing out when prices rebounded. Investors got back $565 million.“Money always burns a hole in your pocket,” Cohen said. “The best thing you can do now is not make a mistake. That can save you a lot more money than mediocre trades can make you.”To be sure, firms with patient capital don’t have to invest right away, and there could be a bigger wave of opportunities after policymakers scale back economic support, according to JPMorgan Asset Management’s David Lebovitz.In the meantime, Oaktree is looking to raise $15 billion for its latest distressed fund and put its money to work outside the U.S. So far, public filings show, only about 10% of its pledged capital was drawn as of February. Oaktree’s pitch to investors cited almost $5 trillion in opportunities across Asia, mostly China, including non-performing loans, bonds, shadow-banking loans and leveraged loans.The lingering question is whether the distressed assets that remain are destined for a recovery, or whether they’re simply being kept afloat by an historic dead-cat bounce that won’t last.“If you had a fundamentally strong business, you could’ve found the liquidity to make it through the challenges of 2020,” Chris Acito, chief investment officer of Gapstow Capital Partners, a New York-based firm that specializes in picking credit-fund managers. “Many of the businesses which are still in distress have flawed business models that will be difficult to revive.”(Updates with D.E.

The superstar investor Mark Cuban said in a tweet that the price increase of more than 340% in the past year was ""EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble"" of the 1990s.

Cuban said Bitcoin and Ethereum could ride out the bubble bursting and thrive. Other analysts, such as those at UBS, were more skeptical.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Bitcoin rose on Tuesday to about $36,000 as the cryptocurrency market recovered from Monday's plunge. But volatility remains high, and the superstar investor Mark Cuban described the recent rise as a ""bubble"" that could be ruinous.

Bitcoin fell as much as 20% on Sunday and Monday, to just above $30,000, in a wave of profit-taking after the currency's spectacular rally. Investor nerves and a stronger dollar also hit crypto confidence.

But its price rose sharply on Monday evening and Tuesday morning, climbing roughly 8% and breaching $36,000 once again. It reached an intraday high of $36,610.11 before paring gains to $34,154.29 as of 10:50 a.m. ET.

The cryptocurrency has risen more than 13% in a week, 92% in a month, and about 340% in a year, after central banks flooded markets with money during the coronavirus crisis.

The remarkable rise in cryptocurrencies has attracted attention from all corners of the markets. On Monday, Cuban said on Twitter that the ""cryptos trade"" was ""EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble"" of the late 1990s, which burst with disastrous consequences for many companies and investors.

But he said Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ""a few others"" could survive and thrive as companies like Amazon and eBay did two decades ago.

Ethereum was up on Tuesday morning to $1,111. It was trading close to its all-time high of more than $1,200, set in early 2018. It has risen by about 675% in the past year.

In another tweet, Cuban warned against trusting crypto evangelists who ""try to justify whatever the pricing of the day is.""

""All the narratives about debasement, fiat, etc are just sales pitches. The biggest sales pitch is scarcity vs demand. That's it,"" he said.

But Bitcoin enthusiasts say this time is different, arguing that a price crash like the one in 2018 - when it hit a record of about $19,900 but plummeted to about $5,870 in eight weeks - is unlikely.

Michael Hall, a cofounder of Nickel Digital Asset Management, said Bitcoin ""is experiencing upside volatility which may correct sharply but tends to resolve reasonably quickly at higher levels as price discovery continues.""

""We do not believe there has been any fundamental change in the outlook for Bitcoin which is now increasingly owned by longer-term investors, weighted towards Europe and North America, looking to buy and hold within multi-asset portfolios,"" Hall said.

UBS analysts took a dimmer view. ""Given their high volatility and the size of their past drawdowns, cryptocurrencies might be attractive to speculative investors, but they are neither a suitable alternative to safe-haven assets, nor do they necessarily contribute to portfolio diversification,"" they said in a note.

The UK's Financial Conduct Authority said on Monday that ""if consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money.""

""Significant price volatility in cryptoassets, combined with the inherent difficulties of valuing cryptoassets reliably, places consumers at a high risk of losses,"" it added.

The Bitcoin price hovered around $35,000 and technical analysts said this point was a pivotal one on the daily charts.

A break above this level could push Bitcoin back towards all-time highs around $41,000, while a marked drop below could trigger a fall towards key support at $30,000, they said.

Although the longer-term outlook for both cryptocurrencies remains skewed to the topside, further losses look likely in the coming days,"" DailyFX strategist Daniel Moss said in a note.

Bitcoin fell on Wednesday, heading for its largest weekly fall since late August, as a combination of a stronger dollar and a bout of profit-taking swept $172 billion in value from the cryptocurrency market since the start of the week, leaving the price at a pivotal point on the charts.

Rival coins such as Ethereum and Ripple Labs' XRP, along with smaller alt-coins Litecoin and Cardano, sagged after several days of heightened volatility.

Trade in cryptocurrencies has been booming for the last five months in particular. Bitcoin has risen by 230% in that time, hitting a record above $41,000 on January 8, while Ethereum has gained 217%, prompting a number of prominent investors to warn about the dangers of speculative bubbles.

Shark Tank star investor Mark Cuban on Tuesday compared the crypto trade to the dot-com bubble of the 1990s in a series of tweets, and like the crash that ensued in early 2000, said any bursting would see some coins survive, and others fail.

""The cryptocurrency market has come under fire in recent days, with Bitcoin and Ethereum both sinking lower as a wave of risk aversion sweeps across global financial markets. Although the longer-term outlook for both cryptocurrencies remains skewed to the topside, further losses look likely in the coming days,"" DailyFX strategist Daniel Moss said in a note.

Bitcoin was last trading around $34,580, up around 1.65% on the day on the Coinbase exchange.

With the retreat to $35,000, the Bitcoin price is hovering around key technical levels on the charts, and a break above, or below, those levels could pave the way for the next burst towards record highs, or a more protracted decline, analysts said.

""Failing to gain a firm foothold above last week's close ($38,200) would probably open the door for sellers to drive prices back towards psychological support at $30,000. Clearing that may pave the way for a push back towards former resistance-turned-support at the 2017 high ($19,891), Moss said.

Bitcoin is still a full 95% above where it was a month ago, but the technical charts show that this latest retracement in price this week has brought a number of support levels - a level at which the price should hold in the event of a more aggressive sell-off - into play.

The Bitcoin price is nearing a key Fibonacci retracement level. Fibonacci retracements are a series of horizontal lines on a chart that show where support and resistance are likely to emerge based on an asset price's recent highs and lows and a breach of a key line can often trigger a swift move higher, or lower.

Chris Svorcik, a technical analyst who writes for FXEmpire, said Bitcoin needed to stay above $29,762, which is the half-way point between the low of December 11 and the high on January 12, or 50% retracement, to avoid a drop towards $26,000.

4-hour technical chart of BTC/USD Chris Svorcik-FXEmpire

""As long as price stays above the 50-61.8% Fibonacci support zone, an uptrend has the best chance of continuing higher (blue arrow) for new high. Only a break below the deep Fibonacci levels would change and invalidate that view,"" he said.

Ethereum, which on Wednesday was trading up 2.8% on the day around $1,079 on the Kraken exchange, also finds itself at a tipping point on the technical charts. The price rattled to a three-year high at $1,350 late on Sunday, but its decline since then means it has now surrendered over half of the gains made since the start of 2021, leaving it hovering at a key Fibonacci retracement level.

""Ethereum would need to move through the 23.6% FIB and the pivot level at $1,069 to support a run at the first major resistance level at $1,131,"" Bob Mason, a technical analyst who writes for FXEmpire, said.

""Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $1,100 levels,"" he said, adding: ""In the event of an extended crypto rally, Ethereum could test resistance at $1,250 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $1,212.""

4-hour ETH/USD technical chart Bob Mason-FXEmpire","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde called on Wednesday for global regulation of Bitcoin, saying the digital currency had been used for money laundering activities in some instances and that any loopholes needed to be closed.

Bitcoin has come out of its niche in recent years and is now bought by ordinary people, investment funds and even large corporations. Some have even taken out loans to buy more of the cryptocurrency, whose value has increased almost tenfold since last March.

But its largely anonymous nature has raised concerns that it could be used for money laundering and other illegal activities.

“(Bitcoin) is a highly speculative asset, which has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity,” Lagarde said in an interview at the Reuters Next conference.

Lagarde did not provide specific examples of money laundering cases but said she understood there had been criminal investigations into illegal activity. She did not elaborate.

The cryptocurrency sector is still mostly lightly overseen or unregulated, although global standards on areas such as anti-money laundering (AML) have emerged.

She joined a number of regulators from across the world in calling for implementing global rules for cryptocurrencies.

“There has to be regulation. This has to be applied and agreed upon ... at a global level because if there is an escape that escape will be used,” Lagarde said.

To watch Reuters Next live, visit here","There's been a lot of debate about how bitcoin compares to gold as a safe-haven asset, but one firm predicts that bitcoin won't replace gold. In a recent white paper, Peltz International made several predictions about bitcoin.

The firm also believes bitcoin's dominance among cryptocurrencies will be reduced in 2021.

Gold Versus Bitcoin

Peltz noted a few similarities between gold and bitcoin. Both have a limited supply and can be mined. Both have limited utility and derive value from the trust placed on them by society. Finally, both are durable and likely to last many lifetimes.

Because of these similarities, many perceive bitcoin as a store of value like gold. Some have even referred to the cryptocurrency as ""digital gold"" because of its safe-haven characteristics. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones argued that bitcoin futures could be a hedge against inflation caused by central banks' money printing. He also thought about gold and other assets before considering bitcoin as a store of value.

Bitcoin Won't Replace Gold

Anthony Tu-Sekine of Seward Kissel told Peltz that gold won't become worthless because of the view some people have taken of bitcoin. Both will be safe havens for different reasons. Different groups of people prefer gold over bitcoin and vice versa.

Tu-Sekine said bitcoin could take up a position next to gold as a ""store of value that people believe in."" He added that with the recent stimulus bills, a lot of money is floating around. Thus, people might look for assets that ""are not subject to the ability of governments to just create more.""

Peltz said JPMorgan estimates that family offices invest about 0.18% of their assets in bitcoin and 3.3% of their assets in gold exchange-traded funds. The bank's analysts add that bitcoin doesn't threaten gold's status as a currency of last resort. They don't believe bitcoin's rally will cannibalize gold's bull market, and they think both can coexist.

Declining Dominance In The Crypto Market

Peltz also argues that bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market will fall this year. Bitcoin made up 71.3% of the total crypto market cap at the end of the year, compared to a low of 57% in August. The performance of most other cryptocurrencies lagged bitcoin's gains last year, and many are still far below their 2017 peaks.

In December, Ripple lost approximately 75% of its value after reaching a two-year high the month before. The SEC sued Ripple Labs in December, alleging that XRP is a security rather than a cryptocurrency. The agency accuses Ripple of making a $1.3 billion unregistered offering, and several crypto exchanges suspended trading of XRP.

Peltz believes that in 2021, other cryptocurrencies could become more prominent and increase in value. That could push bitcoin's percentage of the total market cap lower. The firm noted that many are optimistic about Ethereum. The cryptocurrency is planning a network upgrade in 2023, which Peltz believes could result in a price increase and possibly even cause Ethereum to move on its own fundamentals instead of tracking bitcoin.

Enter Maren Altman, bitcoin investor and astrologer.

The New Yorker has been following the movements of celestial objects to predict bitcoin price fluctuations since last summer. And while many people might mock her methods, she has built up a 1 million-strong social-media following on TikTok.

Last week, the 22-year-old told her followers to watch for a price correction on Jan. 11.

Why? Saturn was going to cross Mercury.

Lo and behold, bitcoin fell as much as 21% on that day, before recovering most of its losses, slamming the brakes on a meteoric rally that saw it double from early December to a record $42,000 last week.

“I am never going to tell someone to buy this or that,” said Altman. “I can predict price trajectories but do not claim to be a financial adviser aware of someone’s specific circumstances, and therefore never give buy or sell advice.”

For the uninitiated, Mercury represents bitcoin’s price data and Saturn is a restricting indicator.

While many people might give Altman’s analysis as much credence as any fortune-telling, she is among a growing cohort of young TikTok influencers who began posting content on cryptocurrencies as prices rallied in 2020.

They’re jumping on the bandwagon for bitcoin, whose mysterious movements even baffle many financial analysts, who say cryptocurrencies lack the fundamental data points used to assess traditional assets.

“I’m a bit of a cynic when it comes to bitcoin projections,” said Craig Erlam, an analyst at forex broker OANDA. “I think it’s just a selection of people clutching at straws, trying to justify any reasons to be bullish.”

Bitcoin has jumped over five-fold since the start of 2020, prompting investment banks to predict more future gains. Citigroup said bitcoin could hit $318,000, while JPMorgan Chase & Co tipped it to reach $146,000.

So what do the stars have in store for the world’s favourite cryptocurrency?

“I see some favourable indicators at the end of the month and especially February and early March,” said Altman, whose readings of bitcoin’s astrology charts are based on the date for the coin’s genesis block, the equivalent of its birthday.

“However getting into mid-March, I see a big correction. Mid-April is also really less optimistic. May is bullish.”","Why did this happen?

The soaring price of bitcoin has boosted the fortunes of the cryptocurrency mining industry, which is seeing record profits amid surging investor interest in digital assets. The infrastructure to support bitcoin mining has scaled up in low-cost facilities outside the traditional data center industry, supported by a sophisticated financial ecosystem.

The value of bitcoin has set record highs in recent weeks, moving from $10,000 in September to a peak of $42,000 last week before settling at around $35,000 today. Miner revenue has soared along with the price of bitcoin, boosting the share prices of publicly-held mining firms and triggering large orders for new capacity.

Public mining company Marathon Patent Group today announced plans to raise $250 million through a direct stock offering, and plans to use the proceeds to buy new mining computers and expand the company’s infrastructure.

Another example is today’s announcement that cryptocurrency colocation specialist Compute North will partner with Foundry Digital to add 47 megawatts of bitcoin mining capacity at its facilities in the United States. The companies say their target clients are institutional investors seeking to acquire bitcoin, which is actively traded as a commodity in the United States, as well as serving as a global digital currency for transactions.

Compute North offers large-scale facilities in industrial facilities in Texas and South Dakota, as well as a Nebraska site where it deploys containerized data modules. Foundry is part of Digital Currency Group, a financial services company focused on cryptocurrency, and specializes in financing and staking bitcoin mining operations.

“This partnership will further strengthen our relationship as we make bitcoin mining more accessible to institutional investors and businesses in North America,” said Mike Colyer, CEO of Foundry. “We have been hosting mining devices with Compute North for more than one year now and it is one of our preferred hosting providers for our clients.”

Improved Pricing & Profits Drive Miner Growth

The demand for more infrastructure is driven by the improved profitability for mining operations as the price of bitcoin has climbed. The return on a terahash per second (TH/s) of computing power has improved from 7.8 cents in October to 28.4 cents last week, according to Coindesk. As a result, the total hashrate (computing power) of the bitcoin network this week surged to a record 150 TH/s, up from 105 TH/s at this time last year.

Foundry helps mining operations buy hardware for bitcoin mining, which usually uses specialized semiconductors known as ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). In the Compute North partnership, Foundry will acquire 14,000 MicroBT Whatsminer mining devices, with half owned by Foundry and being housed at Compute North facilities. The other half will be available for sale through Compute North through a “mining-as-a-service” managed blockchain offering for investors, with block rewards sent to customer wallets. Investors can either purchase the operating devices directly from Compute North or finance them through Foundry with a down payment, and get the mining machines running at Compute North’s facilities.

Last month Foundry announced a similar arrangement with Core Scientific, another large North American mining specialist, providing $12 million in equipment financing to the company and an additional $11 million for Core Scientific’s customers to acquire mining gear.

The price surge has also been good news for the handful of mining operators that are publicly-held. After a large run-ups in their stock prices, four bitcoin mining companies now have market capitalizations in excess of $1 billion, including Marathon, Hive Blockchain, Riot Blockchain and Bit Digital.

Industrial Scale, Crypto Economics

Bitcoin is a digital currency developed in 2009 by an anonymous programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto. It is based on a public ledger known as the blockchain, with each transaction verified using cryptography. Bitcoin incentivizes computer users to process transactions by offering financial rewards paid out in virtual currency (hence “mining”). As users share more computing power with the network, they improve their chances of earning rewards.

The rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum has led to a new breed of computing facilities featuring high-density hardware, low-reliability electrical infrastructure and off-the-shelf enclosures. These hashing centers often are built in old warehouses and house servers on shelving from hardware stores.

Bitcoin miners yearn for cheap space and power, and lots of it. They typically run high-density racks and invest less in backup infrastructure, which is a key component of the value of a commercial data center. Some utility-scale bitcoin miners have developed modular data centers or immersion containers in which servers are dunked in pools of coolant. Some data center providers have begun offering “variable resiliency” space with limited generator or UPS support as a lower-priced option for bitcoin mining companies.","Then, last August, John M. Griffin and Amin Shams, two academics who study cryptocurrencies, published the final version of a paper that had been attracting great attention in the cryptocurrency world since it was published in an earlier form in June 2018. Their 119-page study, “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?” analyzed flows of Tether and Bitcoin, finding that half the movement in Bitcoin prices during part of the 2017 bubble were driven by “one entity.” As the academics stated, “we find that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices.”

Griffin and Sham’s analysis also suggested that Tether wasn’t sufficiently backed and that the company might be printing coins and moving assets around to cover holes in its balance sheet. “Tether claimed our paper was incorrect,” said Griffin in a phone call. “But we appreciate the fact that due to the work of the New York AG, the lawyer on record admitted their currency was unbacked. Tether has confirmed the main finding of our paper.” (Paolo Ardoino did not respond when contacted for comment via Twitter, but Tether general counsel Stuart Hoegner issued a statement to TNR calling the study “roundly discredited.” He claimed that “there is no causal relationship between the issuance of Tethers and market movements up or down” and that “Tether is always 100% backed by Tether reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents.”)*

The trouble with Tether is not just one fly-by-night company with opaque financial dealings. Bitfinex and Tether’s web of relationships extends throughout the cryptocurrency world, encompassing numerous exchanges, wealthy traders, and unaccountable executives living in the margins between legal jurisdictions. Even Bitfinex has portrayed itself as a victim of yet another concern, a Panamanian “shadow bank” called Crypto Capital that handled money for major crypto exchanges—until some of its backers, including former NFL owner Reginald Fowler , were arrested on embezzlement charges. Bitfinex maintains that Crypto Capital made off with $850 million of its money but that the two companies never even had a written contract. (The New York Attorney General has alleged that Bitfinex used Tether funds to cover up the shortfall.)

If Tether’s critics are right and this is a rehash of the 2017 bubble—but bigger—how long can the company keep pumping the Bitcoin market while multiple investigations bear down on it? And if the price of Bitcoin can be manipulated—by a company that simply prints digital money (not unlike the Federal Reserve’s practice of quantitative easing, a policy despised by Bitcoiners)—doesn’t that undercut one of the core selling points of Bitcoin?","Outages have been compounded by cryptocurrency mining, which uses banks of high-powered computers.

Cities across Iran have been cloaked in thick layers of toxic smog and darkened by blackouts, as the alleged use of low-quality fuel and power-sucking cryptocurrency mining deepen the country’s hardships.

Tehran’s Hamshahri newspaper, the country’s most-read daily, ran the headline, “20 Days Living in Smoke,” on Wednesday over a photo of the capital covered in smog.

Power plants have been forced to switch to burning low-grade fuel oils to generate electricity because high levels of domestic consumption have led to natural-gas shortages, the semi-official Iranian Students’ News Agency reported. Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh denied earlier this week that any of Iran’s power stations are using fuel oil to generate electricity.

Other plants have shut down, resulting in blackouts in various cities including the capital, Tehran. Officials there said on Wednesday that pollution levels had become “dangerous,” ISNA reported.

Gas has become scarce because it’s used to heat most Iranian homes, and temperatures have been especially cold this winter. Household use has also increased as people stay at home to avoid coronavirus infection, while travel in private vehicles has shot up as people shun mass transport.

Household gas consumption was up by 30% in late November from a month earlier, Mohammadreza Joulaei, director of supply at the National Iranian Gas Co., told state TV.

The outages have been compounded by the mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which uses banks of high-powered computers to verify the legitimacy of transactions and create units of digital coin, government officials have said.

U.S. sanctions that have isolated Iran from global financial institutions have fueled a surge in cryptocurrency mining in the Islamic Republic, which has some of the cheapest electricity in the world.

The strains on the electricity grid led the government to start cracking down on illegal mining operations, and about 6,000 mining machines were recently confiscated in Markazi province, the managing director of the Markazi Electricity Supply Co., told ISNA.

A spokesman for the country’s electricity industry apologized for the shutdowns on state TV and said power supplies to Bitcoin miners and industry have been strictly limited to meet domestic needs.

The heavy pollution and power shortages are coming at a time when the country is battling Covid-19.

Health officials in the capital have warned that high levels of pollution will exacerbate the effects of the pandemic, which has already caused more deaths in Iran than any other country in the Middle East.

The red-hot cryptocurrency has seen immense volatility in recent days, with thousands of dollars per coin added and wiped out across short periods.

Thursday's surge comes after European Central Bank boss Christine Lagarde called for more regulation the prior day.

Bitcoin rose sharply once again on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, climbing past the $40,000 mark.

It has been a volatile few weeks for bitcoin, with its price hitting an all-time high of close to $42,000 last week before paring. The price has consistently swung around 10% a day as investors buy in and cash out of the cryptocurrency, which has surged more than 330% in a year.

Bitcoin climbed as much as 7.5%, to $40,094.81. Its smaller rival Ethereum rose 7.2% over 24 hours to $1,160.

The dramatic rise in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has sharply divided market opinion, pitting much - although not all - of the financial establishment against a new breed of online investor.

On Wednesday, European Central Bank boss Lagarde said Bitcoin needs to be regulated on a global level and linked it to ""totally reprehensible money laundering.""

Bambos Tsiattalou, a financial crime lawyer at London's Stokoe Partnership Solicitors, said tighter regulation would be a major problem for cryptocurrencies.

""Many people buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because they are worried about and don't trust fiat currencies,"" so greater regulation would demolish much of their appeal, he said.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note: ""With the large decline in the dollar, deeply negative real yields and continued policy uncertainty, investors have been looking for alternatives to traditional cash holdings.""

They added: ""Innovation in digital assets continues rapidly and will likely drive increased

institutional participation over time.""

Yet the analysts cautioned that ""the perception of 'value' and demand can vary materially, for example due to changing regulations.""

The payments, made by a French donor, of 28.15 bitcoins were made on Dec. 8, the New York-based startup, specializing in countering money laundering and fraud in the digital currency space, said in a blog post. (bit.ly/3bG83yE)

Chainalysis said it now has evidence that many alt-right groups and personalities received large bitcoin donations as part of the single transaction.

“We have also gathered evidence that strongly suggests the donor was a now-deceased computer programmer based in France,” Chainalysis said in the report.

Nick Fuentes, who was permanently suspended from YouTube last year for hate speech, received 13.5 bitcoins, worth about $250,000 at the time of the transfer, making him by far the biggest beneficiary of the donation, according to the blog post.

Fuentes could not be reached for a request for comment.","The software also allows the Bitcoin network to confirm the accuracy of the password to allow transactions, without seeing or knowing the password itself. In short, the system makes it possible for anyone to create a Bitcoin wallet without having to register with a financial institution or go through any sort of identity check.

That has made Bitcoin popular with criminals, who can use the money without revealing their identity. It has also attracted people in countries like China and Venezuela, where authoritarian governments are known for raiding or shutting down traditional bank accounts.

But the structure of this system did not account for just how bad people can be at remembering and securing their passwords.

“Even sophisticated investors have been completely incapable of doing any kind of management of private keys,” said Diogo Monica, a co-founder of a start-up called Anchorage, which helps companies handle cryptocurrency security. Mr. Monica started the company in 2017 after helping a hedge fund regain access to one of its Bitcoin wallets.

Mr. Thomas, the programmer, said he was drawn to Bitcoin partly because it was outside the control of a country or company. In 2011, when he was living in Switzerland, he was given the 7,002 Bitcoin by an early Bitcoin fanatic as a reward for making an animated video, “What is Bitcoin?,” which introduced many people to the technology.

That year, he lost the digital keys to the wallet holding the Bitcoin. Since then, as Bitcoin’s value has soared and fallen and he could not get his hands on the money, Mr. Thomas has soured on the idea that people should be their own bank and hold their own money.

“This whole idea of being your own bank — let me put it this way: Do you make your own shoes?” he said. “The reason we have banks is that we don’t want to deal with all those things that banks do.”","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin aims for $41,400 following a significant rebound from the $30,000 support level.

Likewise, Ethereum broke out of a consolidation pattern and now targets new all-time highs.

The high levels of demand for these digital assets suggest that a new bullish cycle has just begun.

Whales appear to have bought the Bitcoin and Ethereum dip following a steep correction on Jan. 10. Now, these cryptocurrencies have regained crucial support levels, reclaiming nearly all lost ground.

Bitcoin Aims for Higher Highs on Low Trading Volume

Bitcoin experienced one of the largest one-day corrections since March 2020’s Black Thursday shortly after surging to a new record peak of $42,125.

The flagship cryptocurrency saw its price plummet by more than 26%, hovering at a high of $41,230 to hit a low of $30,450 within a few hours.

On-chain analyst Willy Woo explained that unlike previous market crashes, the most recent one was triggered by spot markets and “greatly amplified” by Coinbase’s system outage. Roughly $1.70 billion were liquidated across the board, crushing overleveraged investors’ dreams of further gains.

“Spot market sell-off started around $38k, then Coinbase partially failed, not registering buys, causing its price to go $350 lower than others, this pulled down the index price that futures exchanges use to calculate leverage funding, wreaking bearish havoc on speculative markets,” said Woo.

Despite the significant losses incurred, Bitcoin was able to rebound from the 100 moving average on its 4-hour chart as the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential indicator presented a buy signal. On-chain data reveals that whales took advantage of the downswing to add more tokens at a discount to their portfolios.

Indeed, the number of addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC surged by nearly 1% as Bitcoin tumbled. Roughly 20 whales joined the network over this short period, helping prices recover promptly.

The sudden upswing was significant when considering these large investors hold more than $380 million worth of BTC. Primarily, it shows high-net-worth-individuals’ conviction about Bitcoin’s potential to advance further, given the low supply ratio that now sits on exchanges.

If the buying spree continues at the current rate, Bitcoin will likely aim for higher highs.

However, the setup trendline at $41,400 may pose a certain level of resistance on BTC’s way up. But if it manages to break through it, prices could shoot up towards the $50,000 mark.

It is worth noting that the trading volume accompanying the recent rebound does not look promising, according to Skew. Therefore, investors must take a precautionary approach since a rejection from the $41,400 resistance level could result in a pullback towards the 100 or 200 moving averages on the 4-hour chart.

These crucial areas of support sit at $34,000 and $28,400, respectively.

Ethereum Rebound Primed as Crowd Grows Pessimistic

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts seem to have lost faith in Ethereum after its price dropped below the $1,000 support level.

Fear, uncertainty, and doubt took over social media as more than $630 million worth of ETH positions were liquidated across the board. The general belief was that Ethereum was never going to see triple digits again.

According to Santiment, the rising number of negative Ethereum-related posts on social media represents a positive sign.

As the market tends to behave differently than the crowds’ perception, prices could rebound rapidly and “fake out a lot of the doubters.”

The creation of an ascending triangle on ETH’s 4-hour chart adds credence to the bullish thesis. Indeed, Ethereum could rise by more than 20% upon closing above the $1,150 support barrier.

This target is determined by measuring the distance between the triangle’s two highest points and adding it to the breakout point.

IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model reveals that the $1,150 level is the only hurdle ahead of Ethereum that may prevent it from regaining lost ground.

More than 150,000 addresses had previously purchased nearly 7.80 million ETH around this price point.

Such a significant supply barrier may keep rising prices at bay as holders within this price range will likely try to break even each time ETH goes up to avoid incurring further losses. But if the buying pressure is significant enough, prices will likely slice through the overhead resistance to meet the triangle’s target at $1,400.

If Ethereum fails to close above $1,150, the bullish outlook will be jeopardized, leading to a steeper correction.

On the way down, prices may stabilize around the 100 or the 200 moving average on the 4-hour chart. These interest areas sit at $1,000 and $800, respectively.

The Cryptocurrency Market Moves Forward

Demand for Bitcoin and Etheruem is at record highs. This market development has seen a significant decline in the percent of tokens held on exchanges.

Even brokerage platform eToro is said to be dealing with limited liquidity, presenting challenges to its ability to support buy orders over the weekend.

The lack of supply and high buying pressure behind these digital assets are fuelling the on-going bull run. This could be the reason why whales appear to be increasing their holdings at every dip, resulting in clear V-shaped recoveries for BTC and ETH.

With institutional investors flocking into the cryptocurrency market to hedge against inflation, the future looks bright for these digital assets.

Therefore, it is imperative to pay close attention to Bitcoin’s $41,400 resistance and Ethereum’s $1,400 ceiling since moving past these hurdles will ignite another massive bull rally.

Just last week, popular cryptocurrency bitcoin plummeted 25% from all-time highs. But over the last 24 hours, bitcoin is rebounding sharply. According to CoinDesk, it's up 14% as of 12:30 p.m. EST.

We'll explore why bitcoin might be rising in a moment. But we should first note that popular cryptocurrency stocks are also rising today. Here are some of the bigger movers today:

Shares of MicroStrategy NASDAQ:MSTR)

Shares of Marathon Patent Group NASDAQ:MARA)

Shares of Bit Digital NASDAQ:BTBT)

Shares of Riot Blockchain NASDAQ:RIOT)

Shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust OTC:GBTC)

Here's what's happening and how I believe investors should process it all.

So what

With the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, investors can benefit from the rising price of bitcoin without directly owning tokens. To directly own bitcoin, you need a bitcoin wallet or an account with a cryptocurrency exchange (like Coinbase). But Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is a way institutional investors like hedge funds can gain exposure. Furthermore, individual investors could gain tax advantages by holding shares of the trust in their individual retirement accounts (IRAs).

Grayscale, however, does hold bitcoin directly. It physically buys tokens for the trust, and it could be very actively doing that right now.

Barry Silbert is the CEO for Digital Currency Group, parent company of Grayscale. I was unable to track down information from Grayscale directly, but Silbert's Twitter account has been busy putting out information on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Recently he tweeted out that the trust had reopened to new investors and it was buying new bitcoin tokens as a result.

Just how much is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust buying? Reportedly, the trust purchased 2,172 bitcoin tokens yesterday alone. Here's why that number, if true, explains a lot: There's only an estimated 900 new bitcoin tokens mined per day right now. Therefore, demand from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust far outpaced new supply, probably contributing to bitcoin's gains over the past 24 hours.

This is similar to what happened when MicroStrategy was gobbling up bitcoin last month. In December, the company raised $650 million via convertible notes to buy bitcoin. During the days that followed, this one company's demand alone outpaced bitcoin's new supply. MicroStrategy now holds 70,470 tokens on its balance sheet at an average price of $15,964 each. Considering the price of bitcoin is up roughly $5,000 over the past 24 hours, the value of MicroStrategy's balance sheet has also surged by roughly $350 million in unrealized gains over this time period. That's why its stock is up today.

Marathon, Riot Blockchain, and Bit Digital are all bitcoin-mining companies and none reported news today. But these three penny stocks have been among the most popular for traders recently, leading to high volatility and pushing their market-cap valuations north of $1 billion. These companies are taking advantage of their high stock prices in recent days by diluting shareholders to raise cash.

Earlier this week, Bit Digital raised $80 million from a private investor through convertible notes, shrugging off fraud allegations. Similarly, Marathon has more than doubled its share count in recent weeks, raising cash to buy new mining equipment. Marathon's need for more money is a reminder that these bitcoin-mining operations constantly upgrade equipment (especially when the price of bitcoin rises) to keep up with bitcoin's rising hashrate. Therefore, it wouldn't be shocking to see Riot Blockchain announce a stock offering of its own soon.

Now what

When it comes to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, future values are hard to predict since they're very different from stocks. A stock represents a business, which provides a degree of predictability. By contrast, bitcoin doesn't produce anything, so I encourage investors to think in terms of supply and demand. If demand outpaces supply (like when MicroStrategy and Grayscale are buying) then bitcoin can keep going up. If demand dissipates, then bitcoin could fall. Can you make an educated prediction on future demand? If not, it might be best to just stick to stocks.

MicroStrategy's business has been stuck in neutral in recent years, so its stock will likely keep going up and down with the price of bitcoin for now. And as I previously alluded, frothy valuations and the need to upgrade equipment make bitcoin mining stocks a poor investment as well.

That leaves Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. On a fundamental basis, shares trade far beyond the underlying value of the bitcoin tokens it holds. But demand for this vehicle remains strong nonetheless. In its most recent update, it pointed to a record inflow of investments, which could keep shares trading beyond their apparent intrinsic value for now.","As prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to surge this year, many traders are looking for any indicator for when – or if – the bull market will come to an end. Some are convinced they have the answer: They are examining polkadot (DOT), the native token of the Polkadot blockchain, as a potential canary in the coal mine for cryptocurrency.

As of press time, polkadot’s price was at $12.49, up 12.40% in the past 24 hours, according to Messari. It reached its all-time high of $13.22 during early trading hours in the U.S., just six days after bitcoin’s price reached a new all-time high.

The market capitalization of Polkadot has surpassed XRP and litecoin and is now the fourth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to Messari’s asset tracker.

Following in the 2017 footsteps of EOS

Those using polkadot to prognosticate bitcoin’s price point to parallels with another altcoin, EOS.

Sources who spoke to CoinDesk as well as social media users, especially on Chinese-language platforms, see parallels between the 2017 bull market prices of bitcoin and EOS, the native cryptocurrency for the EOS.IO blockchain platform. They said Polkadot, a project started by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood and considered to be one of the so-called “Ethereum killers,” shares similar features and goals of the EOS.IO project, which was also born with the ambition of replacing Ethereum.

A screenshot of a Jan. 14 post on Weibo (China’s Twitter) that claims polkadot is one of the so-called “marketing-oriented” tokens that could give retail investors a chance to make “quick money” right after the bitcoin’s bull run. “If you miss the opportunity now, there won’t be a chance for you to get rich fast after the bull market ends,” it wrote in Chinese. (Weibo)

A screenshot of other posts on Weibo show warnings from some crypto users in China about Polkadot’s potential downfall, citing its similarities to EOS in 2017’s bull run. (Weibo)

After bitcoin’s price reached its peak in 2017’s bull run, many investors and traders took their profits and moved them into tokens like EOS, a period of time now called “alt season.” Prices for EOS reached an all-time high at the end of April 2018, after which “crypto winter” was said to have started.

Claims that EOS and bitcoin prices were related in 2017 and 2018 are contentious.

“Correlation, not causation,” said Terry Wilkinson, chief executive officer at the Tokyo-headquartered investment firm Anchor Value. EOS “was the latest greatest pie-in-the-sky protocol at that time and as such garnered a lot of hype during that cycle. The bull run did not end because EOS stopped pumping. It was kind of the poster child for that run.”

Block.one created EOS.IO in September 2017. The blockchain provides a platform for developers to create decentralized apps (dapps) with the promise of improved scalability compared with Ethereum. The project was also known for its initial coin offering (ICO), which ran from summer 2017 to June 2018, arguably the longest-running ICO in history.

With a large amount of its tokens being turned over to hedge funds to manage and make the majority of the investments in the building the EOS.IO ecosystem, traders and investors took EOS’s price as an indicator of capital inflows to crypto at the time. When EOS’s price stopped pumping, many took it as a sign to exit the market.

EOS.IO “failed to catch up to Ethereum’s position and hype,” Jason Kim, chief investment officer at Anchor Value, added. “Speed alone did not persuade enough people to buy into EOS’ rosy projections.”

Polkadot’s bull case in 2020’s bitcoin rally

Similar to EOS.IO, Polkadot is touted as a promising blockchain that may replace Ethereum’s dominance. It particularly caught the attention of many savvy digital asset investors when decentralized finance (DeFi) exploded in the past summer.

Most DeFi projects are built on the Ethereum blockchain, the second-largest blockchain, which is thought of as a “world computer” due to its versatility and programmability. Yet, some projects have chosen Ethereum alternatives for better scalability and end-user experience, with Polkadot being one of the more popular ones.

As a result, just as many investors back in 2017 were making bets on EOS.IO for its promise to grab market share from Ethereum at the time, investors now have shown a “strong” appetite for Polkadot’s DOT, as CoinDesk reported two months ago.

With that said, many have expressed their doubts about DOT’s possible correlation with bitcoin’s latest bull run. The main drivers of this round are significantly different from 2017, which were then stirred up by retail investors for the ICO boom.

These days, the market has mostly agreed that large institutional investors and the explosive DeFi sub sector took off in the past summer are the primary power behind the latest bull market.

The logic behind the two bull runs are completely different, according to Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading at Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance. Investors who bought bitcoin in this round have not been taking profits from many altcoins such as polkadot.

“[DOT] certainly fills the same slot as EOS did last bull run,” Wilkinson said. “There are parallels to draw since [Polkadot] probably has the highest expectations as the new chain on the block, but my opinion is that this bull run is different than the last mainly because of the involvement of institutional money that was largely vacant during the 2017 run.”

And unlike the ICO boom, many traders and analysts say, the fast-growing realm of DeFi – semi-autonomous exchanges and lenders – has shown much more potential with an ambitious goal to replace the traditional financial world one day.

Indeed, while the “summer of DeFi” cooled down, the sector still remains quite active. Multiple DeFi tokens have seen double-digit growth in the past few days. Brian Brooks, the outgoing acting head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), wrote in a Financial Times op-ed about a future of “self-driving” banks backed by the DeFi sector.

Thus the rapid price growth in DOT could just be a reflection of the DeFi’s continuing growth, as well as new upgrades and improvements on the project.

Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, said a recently released 2021 roadmap by SushiSwap, a decentralized exchange which includes an integration with Polkadot, could be the reason why DOT’s price has been up.","The mayor of Miami wants to make his city more appealing to the tech industry by embracing bitcoin and even investing some government funds in the cryptocurrency.

LOSING A BITCOIN PASSWORD CAN COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

Bitcoin surged by as much as 284% from the beginning of October through its record high of $40,797 on Jan. 7. After significant losses earlier this week, the cryptocurrency has bounced back, with the price hitting above $40,000 for a certain period of time on Thursday morning, according to CoinDesk.

Suarez is hoping the move toward bitcoin may appeal to the tech industry and lead more high-tech companies to move to Miami.

However, they matter a great deal more in cryptocurrency investing than other assets. Mint explains their significance in the cryptocurrency world.

Is bitcoin held on crypto exchanges?

Bitcoin can be held in an online wallet with a cryptocurrency exchange. In technical terms, this is similar to holding shares in a demat account or mutual funds with a Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA). If you lose your password to your broking account, demat account or mutual fund portal, you can retrieve it by emailing or calling the relevant intermediary (broker/distributor/depository) and generating a new password. Similarly, you can contact the crypto exchange and get a new password. In technical terms, a bitcoin/crypto password is called a private key and this is known to the platform in question.

Can it be held outside the crypto exchanges?

Yes, you can move your bitcoin to a non-custodial wallet, which is also called a cold wallet or cold storage. These wallets tend to be hardware devices or even pieces of paper with QR codes. They are not connected to the internet, except when you are actively conducting a transaction in and out of them and hence cannot be hacked into. However, if your device or paper is stolen, then your private key can be stolen by a thief. Such a theft would have to be physical. You might also lose the paper/device. But as long as you remember the password, the public key can be retrieved, even if the paper or hardware storage is lost/destroyed.

Should we hold bitcoin on exchanges or off them?

The answer depends on how frequently you transact in bitcoin. Frequent users will find the convenience of online exchange-held wallet attractive. However, if you are a long-term investor, you may want to move cryptocurrency to a cold (offline) wallet. This removes the risk of online hacking. On the flip side, you still run the risk of the wallet being stolen or forgetting password.

What happens when passwords go missing?

Unlike exchanges, cryptocurrency held in cold storage simply gets lost. It continues to exist on the blockchain without any owner. This is like cash or gold which is buried in a forest and its location forgotten. No government or company can take control of it. This is unlike bank accounts or mutual funds lying dormant where regulators take possession of such money and transfer it to investor protection funds. Also, since such bitcoin cannot be spent, it tends to reduce the supply of bitcoin in the system and cushions the price.

Can any precautions be taken by investors?

If you have moved cryptocurrency into cold storage, treat the wallet in question like cash or gold. Keep it in a locker at home or in a bank where it cannot be easily stolen. Do not trust anyone with the password. Once cryptocurrency is seized from you by a third party, it cannot be recovered by a court order. The courts or police cannot ‘freeze’ the crypto account of the thief because, in this instance, the cryptocurrency is not held by a regulated entity. Instead, it is directly held by the person who has the private key, like cash/gold.

Investors have raced to buy and sell bitcoin-linked securities on both sides of the Atlantic, with one German exchange traded product garnering trading volumes matching Europe’s most popular funds.

BTCetc Bitcoin Exchange Traded Crypto (BTCE) has recorded average daily trading amounting to €57m in the first 11 days of January, according to data from Deutsche Börse.

A similar trend has taken hold on Wall Street. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, which like its German counterpart tracks the price of the digital currency, has posted average daily turnover of almost $1bn in the first two weeks of this year, amounting to more than nine-times the average in 2020, Bloomberg data show. Its assets under management have boomed to $23bn from $17bn at the end of December and $2bn at the start of 2020.

The sharp rise in trading in the securities highlights how investors are increasingly looking to gain exposure to or bet against cryptocurrencies on traditional markets rather than buying the digital currencies outright.

The trading surge in BTCE this year — a sharp pick-up on the €15.5m daily average in December, the previous record — comes following a tenfold rise in the price of bitcoin since March to a peak of $42,000 earlier this month, before it gave back some gains.

Stephan Kraus, head of Deutsche Börse’s ETF segment, said the structure of the BTCE exchange traded note, which eased the regulatory concerns and counterparty risk involved in trading bitcoin, had “increased the appeal of cryptocurrency investments for institutional investors”, which can trade without needing to set up specialised digital infrastructure or use an “unregulated crypto platform”.

Deutsche Börse’s trading data show a number of trades above €30,000, which the group said were unlikely to be from day traders or other retail investors.

Bradley Duke, co-founder and chief executive of ETC Group, the issuer of BTCE, said he thought institutional investors were starting to buy the cryptocurrency as a “safe haven”.

“Bitcoin has always had a retail groundswell, people who have an interest in technology, and it was seen as a ‘wild west’ investment. That has really changed in the last six months,” he said.

“Coronavirus has played a part in that. It’s starting to look like an attractive alternative to currencies that may be devalued by the stimulus packages. The packages are needed but there are real concerns they may set inflationary forces in play.”

Still, the cryptocurrency market has remained dominated by retail traders and more speculative firms including hedge funds, as opposed to traditional money managers such as pension funds, which remain nervous about bitcoin’s intense price swings.

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has banned the sale of cryptocurrency-related derivatives, including exchange traded notes, to retail investors. It also this week renewed its warning that anyone investing in crypto assets “should be prepared to lose all their money”.

Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, on Wednesday called for global regulation of cryptocurrencies to help combat their use in “totally reprehensible money laundering activity”.

Also on Wednesday, ETC Group listed similar exchange traded notes denominated in dollars, sterling and Swiss francs on SIX, the Swiss exchange, with Mr Duke saying more products would be launched “in the next few weeks” based on other cryptocurrencies and a basket of cryptos.

Continental Europe has seen a flurry of similar launches, with VanEck and 21Shares also offering bitcoin ETNs on Deutsche Börse. The Swiss exchange now lists 34 crypto exchange traded products from six issuers.","What happened

Many investments with hooks into the cryptocurrency market fell hard on Friday, following an 11.6% drop in bitcoin prices in 24 hours.

Company Relation to bitcoin Max price drop on 1/15/2021 Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) Bitcoin mining 15.2% CleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) Bitcoin mining 15.1% Grayscale Bitcoin (OTC:GBTC) Investment trust holding bitcoin assets 12.4% Ebang International (NASDAQ:EBON) Makes specialized bitcoin mining computers 11% Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ:MARA) Cryptocurrency mining 10.6% MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) Converted $1.13 billion of long-term cash reserves into bitcoin 9.0%

So what

Bitcoin prices have largely been skyrocketing since early October 2020, rising from roughly $11,000 to more than $40,000 per token in a three-month span. Since reaching a peak on Jan. 9, bitcoin prices have meandered over the last week and a half. There was a big drop on Monday, Jan. 11, and a fairly steady climb back up during the rest of this week. Token prices nearly reached the $40,000 benchmark again before tumbling again today.

Cryptocurrencies have gained the attention of large investment firms this year, a major reason behind bitcoin's big gains in recent months. At the same time, the big names can cause sudden price drops from time to time. Today, investment firm UBS Global Wealth Management reminded investors that the bitcoin rally could end in tears. Cryptocurrencies are risky and volatile, and investors could end up losing everything they put into this unproven asset class.

""There is little in our view to stop a cryptocurrency's price from going to zero when a better designed version is launched or if regulatory changes stifle sentiment,"" UBS analyst Michael Bolliger wrote.

That was enough to cause a sobering price drop that also hamstrung many stocks that had been following bitcoin upward.

Now what

Bolliger is right, of course. The regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which adds to the market uncertainty. Investing everything in a single cryptocurrency is a very bad idea, because a better version really could replace bitcoin at the top of the heap. I'm not saying that this will happen but the risk is not zero percent. If you're investing in cryptocurrencies today, it's probably best to divide your holdings between bitcoin and a few other respectable names such as Ethereum and Litecoin. All the major names happen to be falling today, but their performance can vary widely from time to time.

Don't cry for the bitcoin specialists, though. With the exception of the micro-cap Ebang International, all of them have performed extremely well during the current bitcoin boom. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust gained 347% over the last 52 weeks and MicroStrategy rose 331% over the same period. CleanSpark's stock posted a 614% gain. And if you thought those results were impressive, we haven't even talked about Riot Blockchain's 1,964% return or Marathon's crushing 2,374% gains. All of that is after going through Friday's significant haircuts.

Cryptocurrencies can be fun, exciting, and profitable -- but you can also lose sleep over their risky nature and sudden price drops. You can't bet on these promising assets without accepting a large serving of risk. Today was simply not a good day for bitcoin and friends.","Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager with $20.2 billion in AUM, has just released its Digital Asset Investment Report for the fourth quarter of 2020.

The quarter saw unprecedented investment inflows for the firm, with $3.3 billion total investment into Grayscale products during the period, 93 percent of which came from institutional investors, principally asset managers.

Grayscale registered $5.7 billion in investments into Grayscale Products in 2020 as a whole, more than four times the $1.2 billion cumulative inflow into its products from 2013-2019. An average of $90 million each week poured into just its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in 2020, outpacing mined bitcoin by 194 percent.

”Bitcoin’s ability to perform during a period of significant volatility attracted the attention of more financial institutions, investors, and industry observers than ever before,” Grayscale’s analysts wrote in the report. “Influential figures in finance and technology showed public support for Bitcoin as an investment, product, and monetary good. When the history books are written, 2020 will be noted as a major inflection point for the adoption of Bitcoin, and digital currencies more broadly.”

Forward demand drivers

Looking ahead, Grayscale predicts six key factors will drive Bitcoin’s price action in 2021.

In 2020, they note, financial institutions began adding Bitcoin to their corporate balance sheets as cryptocurrencies enjoyed rising appeal as a portfolio diversifier. Major investors, advisory firms, and even banks warmed to Bitcoin, they note, and where allocating cryptocurrency was once a career risk, the risk is increasingly in not allocating. Following institutional embrace in 2020, they write, 2021 may see nation states follow suit.

Second, they note, RIA interest surged in the fourth quarter, and financial advisors continue to field an unprecedented number of inquiries on digital currencies. Given Bitcoin’s price performance in 2020, they say it’s reasonable to expect that more investors and advisors alike will be considering how to best fit this asset class within a larger portfolio. Wealth managers advise on approximately $80 trillion in assets and most have not yet recommended digital assets.

Third, they say, U.S. payment cards offering Bitcoin rewards could become a significant source of Bitcoin demand. U.S. credit cards account for $4 trillion in annual spending, and debit cards another $3 trillion. In 2020, card issuers including 2 Fold, CashApp, and BlockFi debuted cards featuring Bitcoin rewards, which could entice the major credit card companies could follow suit.

Additionally, Grayscale notes that Bitcoin has become an acknowledged clean energy incentive. The energy intensiveness of mining, as well as the geographical concentration of mining (the majority of it in China) have been cited as critical drawbacks of the asset. But that may be changing. North America, they note, is becoming a mining powerhouse, with companies like Foundry—which provides digital asset mining resources—integrating Bitcoin mining into more efficient energy infrastructure. Energy companies are seeing economic incentives to put previously wasted energy to good, profitable use. As a result, they say, Bitcoin mining is helping to subsidize underutilized energy infrastructure and may be integrated into public green energy initiatives.

Moreover, societies around the world are seeing the emergence of “Decentralized Finance” (DeFi) as an economic phenomenon, powering liquid lending, borrowing and exchange. is emerging. As the search for yield intensifies in traditional markets, Grayscale expects major financial firms to consider integrating with decentralized protocols.

Finally, they predict, 2021 may see the beginning of digital currencies integrating into national banking infrastructures. While many countries have laws around digital currencies, few have yet seriously introduced or incorporated them into the set of financial tools that governments have at their disposal. Recent guidance from the OCC suggests that U.S. banks, in particular, may look to incorporate digital currencies into their settlement infrastructure.

“2020 was the year institutional investors recognized that Bitcoin is a viable option for offsetting the abundance of paper money and the cumbersome nature of gold,” Grayscale concludes in the report. “In a world with over $17 trillion of negative yielding debt, we believe Bitcoin will continue to become a cornerstone of investors’ portfolios in 2021.”","Sandeep Patil, a joint commissioner of police of the city of Bengaluru in India, announced today that the Karnataka police has seized Bitcoin worth 9 crore INR ($1.23 million) from an arrested hacker.

According to a report by India Today, the hacker named Srikrishna alias Shreeki was arrested on 18 November for allegations of breaking into government websites. During the investigation, police discovered that Shreeki had hacked 3 Bitcoin exchanges and 10 poker sites to steal more than 30 Bitcoin.

The hacker used malware to target government websites, he also hacked online gaming portals and other websites to win money and crypto assets online. According to a report by ANI, Srikrishna has apparently confessed to hacking the e-procurement website of the Karnataka government in 2019.

The crypto hacks around the world are on the rise, several attacks were reported in recent months. A significant rise in hacking activities is mainly due to a jump in cryptocurrency prices. The cryptocurrency market cap jumped above $1 trillion earlier this month as the value of the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin now stands at around $38,000.

Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Hacks

India has encountered several hacks in the past related to Bitcoin and other crypto-assets. Microsoft released a report earlier in 2020 and mentioned that Indian users have a relatively higher chance of facing a crypto attack.

“India recorded a cryptocurrency mining encounter rate that was 4.6 times higher and drive-by download attack volume that was three times higher than the regional and global average. India registered the seventh-highest malware encounter rate across the region, at 5.89 percent in the past year. This was 1.1 times higher than the regional average. The report also found that India recorded the third-highest ransomware encounter rate across the region, which was two times higher than the regional average,” the report from Microsoft stated.

In the recent case, Bengaluru police are investigating the matter to check if there are other hackers associated with such incidents.","The reflection of bitcoins in a computer hard drive. Thomas Trutschel | Photothek via Getty Images

LONDON — A British man who accidentally threw out a hard drive with a trove of bitcoin on it is once again urging local city officials to let him search for it in a landfill site. James Howells, a 35-year-old IT engineer from Newport, Wales, said he discarded the device while clearing out his home in 2013. He claims he had two identical laptop hard drives, and that he mistakenly put the one containing the cryptographic ""private key"" needed to access and spend his bitcoins in the trash. After all these years, Howells is still confident he'd be able to recover the bitcoin. Though the external part of the hard drive may be damaged and rusted, he believes the platter inside may still be intact. ""There is a good chance the platter inside the drive is still intact,"" he told CNBC. ""Data recovery experts could then rebuild the drive or read the data directly from the platter."" Howells says he had 7,500 bitcoins which, at today's prices, would be worth more than $280 million. He says the only way to regain access to it would be through the hard drive he threw in the trash eight years ago.

But he needs permission from his local council to search a garbage dump he believes contains the lost hardware. The landfill is not open to the public and trespassing would be considered a criminal offense. Howells has offered to donate 25% of the haul — worth around $70.8 million — to a ""Covid Relief Fund"" for his home city if he manages to dig up the hard drive. He has also promised to fund the excavation project with the backing of an unnamed hedge fund. But the Newport City Council has so far rejected his requests to look through the landfill, citing environmental and funding concerns. And it doesn't seem like local officials are about to budge anytime soon. ""As far as I am aware they have already rejected the offer,"" Howells said. ""Without even having heard our plan of action or without being given a chance to present our mitigations to their concerns regarding the environment, it's just a straight up 'no' every time."" A spokesperson for the council told CNBC it had been ""contacted a number of times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins,"" the first being ""several months"" after Howells first realized the drive had gone missing.","Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini is launching a credit card with cryptocurrency rewards in association with newly acquired crypto startup Blockrize. The Gemini Credit Card will allow consumers to earn up to 3 percent back in bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies on every purchase they make.

Ahead of the credit card’s official launch later this year, Gemini has opened up the Gemini Credit Card waiting list. More than 10,000 Blockrize waitlist customers along with Gemini’s own customers will be provided with early access to the credit card.

“The Gemini Credit Card will make it easier for any consumer to invest in bitcoin and other cryptos without changing their existing behavior,” said Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini. “Rather than deciding how and when to buy crypto, customers can do so when making their everyday purchases. We’re excited to welcome the Blockrize team to Gemini and work together to continue to mainstream crypto.”

(Bloomberg) -- In 2020, China’s efforts to lure foreign funds into its borders finally paid off. Investors from New York to London clamored for its stocks and bonds, cementing the nation’s position on the global stage.Against the wreckage of the global economy and with unprecedented stimulus unleashed by central banks, China’s resilience to the coronavirus and its higher-yielding assets looked attractive. The result was a 62% increase in overseas holdings of local stocks from a year earlier to 3.4 trillion yuan ($520 billion), a 47% fillip for the bond market to 3.3 trillion yuan, and the Chinese currency’s best quarter in more than a decade. Foreign investors bought another net $53.5 billion worth of Chinese debt in January and February this year, according to Gavekal Dragonomics.But that influx -- and influence -- is now creating a headache for the Communist Party. China has long been paranoid about the risks posed by capital flows, especially after a messy currency devaluation in 2015, which is why authorities maintain strict controls on money entering and leaving the country. The scale of the inflows places the country at risk of asset bubbles, which would burst were that money to start pouring out.“The moment this demand becomes too big to manage and starts to pressure financial stability -- or create a threat or risk to financial stability -- it will be curbed,” said Paola Subacchi, professor of International Economics at the University of London’s Queen Mary Global Policy Institute and author of ‘The People’s Money: How China Is Building a Global Currency.’Foreign presence in modern China’s capital markets has never been so great: Beijing has in recent years carved out channels to let funds in, opening stock and bond trading links via Hong Kong and pushing for the inclusion of yuan-denominated assets in major global benchmarks. The overarching goal was to help make markets more efficient and powerful. Institutions such as pension funds would provide stability to a stock market reliant on speculators, while boosting liquidity in a moribund sovereign bond market.Global pandemic stimulus has in some ways made China a victim of its own success. This was illustrated by a November report compiled by the Asian Consultative Council of the Bank for International Settlements, which looked at the impact of capital flows. The People’s Bank of China, one of 12 central banks in the working group, noted that “sharp exchange rate fluctuations and large capital flows would threaten financial stability and have negative real economic consequences.”After last year’s vast inflows, those concerns are now starting to resonate in China’s onshore markets. Expectations of strong growth in the U.S. economy have begun driving Treasury yields higher, narrowing the premium offered by Chinese debt by about 1 percentage point since a record in November. They’re also buoying the dollar and punishing the yuan, which in March weakened about 1.3%. The CSI 300 Index of stocks has fallen more than 10% from this year’s high. The risk of a comeuppance is building.“Outflows are always an important worry,” said David Qu, an economist at Bloomberg Economics. “Authorities may also be worried that inflows, particularly hot money, may become outflows once market conditions change.”Official comments have only grown louder in recent months. In a March 20 speech, top securities regulator Yi Huiman said large flows of “hot money” into China must be strictly controlled. In unusually blunt comments in early March, banking regulator Guo Shuqing said he was “very worried” that asset bubbles in overseas markets would burst soon, posing a risk to the global economy. Li Daokui, a former central bank adviser, blamed the potential for instability on U.S. pandemic relief.To manage and counterbalance the inflows, China has steadily granted an additional quota for onshore funds to invest in securities overseas, in March boosting it to $135 billion -- the highest ever. Other measures include encouraging mutual funds to invest in Hong Kong stocks, which led to record flows into the city in January, and asking financial institutions to limit the amount of offshore financing. Hong Kong in December said it was discussing plans to allow mainland investors to trade bonds in the city, which would also encourage outflows.But those steps are incremental, showing policy makers are wary of going too far the other way. China may struggle to open its financial borders without in some way being at the mercy of Federal Reserve actions, like other emerging economies. The U.S.’s easy monetary policy in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis fueled bubbles in countries from Indonesia to Thailand, which burst when the Fed prepared to raise interest rates.The Fed responded to the pandemic with similar policies to those of 2008 but far faster -- and further. Its balance sheet is now near $7.7 trillion, compared to $4 trillion early last year and the previous peak of $4.5 trillion in 2015. That’s equivalent to about 36% of the country’s gross domestic output, a record.There are few economies that can absorb that kind of money. China’s $10.9 trillion equity market and $18 trillion bond market make the country an obvious target.“China is going to be a very attractive place for capital,” said Wen-Wen Lindroth, lead cross-asset strategist for Fidelity International. “The long term growth rate – the gap they have with income – versus developed markets means they have lot more scope to develop,” she said.The question now is how China deals with this issue, which will become even more pressing as the weighting of yuan assets in global benchmarks increases, drawing in billions of extra dollars. Allowing more outflows will reduce the risk of bubbles, but increases the potential for money to flood out too quickly -- as the country witnessed in the wake of the 2015 currency devaluation.“China has long been very careful about opening its capital account, and that cautious approach is still the most probable one,” Wei He, China Economist at Gavekal, wrote in a March 31 report.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

Warren Buffett has been a vocal critic of Bitcoin in recent years, repeatedly dismissing the cryptocurrency as worthless and a risky, speculative asset.

Crypto fans have brushed off the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO's warnings, driving Bitcoin's price up as much as 350% to record highs over the past year.

Here are Buffett's 16 best quotes about Bitcoin and crypto, edited and condensed for clarity:

1. ""Cryptocurrencies basically have no value and they don't produce anything. They don't reproduce, they can't mail you a check, they can't do anything, and what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for them later on, but then that person's got the problem. In terms of value: zero."" - CNBC, February 2020

2. ""It's ingenious and blockchain is important but Bitcoin has no unique value at all, it doesn't produce anything. You can stare at it all day and no little Bitcoins come our or anything like that. It's a delusion basically."" - CNBC, February 2019

3. ""If you and I buy various cryptocurrencies, they're not going to multiply. There are not going to be a bunch of rabbits sitting there in front of us. They're just gonna sit there. And I gotta hope next time you get more excited after I've bought if from you and then I'll get more excited and buy it from you. We could sit in the house by ourselves and we could keep running up the price between us. But at the end of the time there's one Bitcoin sitting there and now we've gotta find somebody else. They come to an end."" - CNBC, May 2018

4. ""In terms of cryptocurrencies generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending. If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I'd be glad to do it, but I would never short a dime's worth."" - CNBC, January 2018

5. ""Probably rat poison squared."" - Fox Business interview at 2018 meeting

6. ""It's a mirage basically. It's a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? I hope Bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view."" - CNBC, March 2014.

7. ""It's not a currency. It does not meet the test of a currency. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not around in 10 or 20 years. It is not a durable means of exchange, it's not a store of value. It's been a very speculative kind of Buck Rogers-type thing and people buy and sell them because they hope they go up or down just like they did with tulip bulbs a long time ago."" - CNBC, March 2014

8. ""A rising price does create more buyers and people think 'I've gotta get in on this' and it's better if they don't understand it. If you don't understand it you get much more excited than if you understand it."" - CNBC, May 2018

10. ""You're going to be a lot better off owning productive assets over the next 50 years than you will be owning pieces of paper or Bitcoin."" - CNBC, March 2014

11. ""I get in enough trouble with things I think I know something about. Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don't know anything about? We don't have to know what cocoa beans are gonna do, or cryptocurrencies, we just have to focus on eight or 10 stocks.""- CNBC, January 2018

12. ""It draws in a lot of charlatans. It's something where people who are of less than stellar character see an opportunity to clip people who are trying to get rich because their neighbor's getting rich buying this stuff that neither one of them understands. It will come to a bad ending."" - 2018 shareholder meeting

13. ""Bitcoin has been used to move around a fair amount of money illegally. The logical move from the introduction of bitcoin is to go short suitcases because the money that was taken in suitcases from one country to another - suitcases will probably fall off in demand. You can look at that as the economic contribution of bitcoin to the society."" - CNBC, February 2020

14. ""We don't own any, we're not short any. We'll never have a position in them."" - CNBC, January 2018

15. ""I don't have any Bitcoin. I don't own any cryptocurrency, I never will. I may start a Warren currency, maybe I can create one and say there's only going to be 21 million of them. You can have it after I die but you can't do anything with it except sell it to somebody else."" - CNBC, February 2020

16. ""I'm really sorry it happens because people get their hopes up that something like that is gonna change their lives."" - CNBC, February 2019

Key Takeaways Laurent Bachelier, AKA Pankkake, was an early adopter of Bitcoin, often rubbing shoulders with figures like Monero developer Riccardo Spagni in IRC chatrooms in 2013.

Citing the downfall of Western civilization, Pankkake allegedly sent white nationalists in the U.S. $500,000, including almost $250,000 in BTC, to “white majoritarian” Nick Fuentes.

Bachelier suffered from a serious illness and posted a suicide note on his blog the day after the donation.

Supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Washington D.C. Capitol Building last week in protest of Trump’s election defeat, killing five people, including two police officers. Reports later revealed that many involved had been funded with Bitcoin.

Many alt-right and white nationalist figures were present at the riots, including self-described “white majoritarian” Nick Fuentes, outspoken neo-nazi Baked Alaska, and various other high-profile white supremacists.

The riot was planned via the social media site Parler starting Jan. 6, with Wild Protest movement leader Ali Alexander stating, “If DC escalates… so do we.”

Bitcoin Funds Capital Riots

On Dec. 8, a single donor sent over 28.15 BTC worth over $520,000 at the time to multiple alt-right figures and organizations, including figures directly involved in the Capitol Hill unrest.

Cybersecurity firm Chainalysis identified the transactions and tracked them, building a paper trail.

Through the Namecoin blockchain, Chainalysis identified the donor as “Pankkake.” According to Chainalysis, domestic extremists in the U.S. have been receiving foreign funding traceable on the Bitcoin blockchain since at least 2016.

Nick Fuentes, a self-described “white majoritarian” and anti-LGBT speaker banned from YouTube for denying the Holocaust, received 45% of the Dec. 8 funds. That sum amounted to 13.5 BTC or approximately $250,000 at the time.

Chainalysis reports that Pankkake donated funds to the Daily Stormer, a neo-nazi media outlet, as well as alt-right podcaster Ethan Ralph, and the U.S. white supremacist group VDARE.

While most of the recipients were from the U.S., Pankkake also allegedly donated $26,000 to French neo-nazi and Holocaust denier Vincent Reynourard.

The cybersecurity firm stated its belief that Pankkake may have been an early adopter of Bitcoin who was active in crypto since 2013 and accumulated wealth as BTC gained in value.

Tracing The Mystery Donor’s Identity

Crypto Briefing traced the Pankakke NameCoin handle to Freenode chat logs archived on BTCbase.org where a user identifying themselves as “Pankkake,” a French programmer interested in Namecoin, had been a regular poster.

Pankkake’s early political leanings can be seen in various racist, anti-semitic, and transphobic comments, stating “blacks are born to be slaves anyway” in 2013.

Pankkake was often in contact with Monero creator Riccardo Spagni, AKA Fluffy Pony, during that time. Their discussion focused on cryptocurrency and blogging, and Spagni informed Crypto Briefing that they never spoke in private.

Spagni privately shared with the author his rating for Pankkake on Bitcointalk, where he called Pankkake the “The Trolliest Troll of Trollsville.”

Hey – I knew him as someone on the #bitcoin-assets on Freenode, I don't think I ever even had a private conversation with him, so sadly not much I can comment on. I knew he was French-speaking. — Riccardo Spagni (@fluffypony) January 15, 2021

Pankkake discussed blogging with other users, including Mirceau Popescu, Romanian entrepreneur and founder of the now-defunct BitBet US site. Popescu was banned from Twitter in 2014 for threatening to kill Andreas Antonopoulos.

In the 2013 chat logs, a Freenode user linked a racist blog post that Popescu wrote on his personal site. Pankkake’s comments on that blog led Crypto Briefing to Pankkake’s own blog, called Headfucking, which contained various projects and files, including adult content and a fan site for a metal goregrind band.

Finally, the Headfucking site led Crypto Briefing to a blog under Pankakke’s real name, where his final post was a suicide note.

Suicide Note

Pankkake’s name was Laurent Bachelier, a Parisian programmer with 47 repositories on GitHub.

His blog featured his thoughts on Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, among other topics, with no posts from 2015 to late 2020.

Bachelier posted a suicide note on Dec. 9, 2020, one day after the 28 BTC donation was made. He stated that he suffered from Trigeminal neuralgia, a neuropathic disorder, also known as the “suicide disease,” characterized by extreme and chronic nerve pain. Bachelier cites tinnitus and fatigue, among other health problems, as reasons for his suicide.

“If you are reading this, I am deceased. This is a message scheduled to be posted in the future; so there is no chance that i survived.”

Bachelier went on to list more reasons, including his view that “Western civilization is declining,” while also bringing up Holocaust denial and 9/11 conspiracy theories by referencing “wooden doors” and “building 7.”

As examples of this Western decline, he stated his belief that the COVID-19 virus is not dangerous and that the police did not really kill George Floyd, making the BLM protests against his killing unjustified.

He ended the list lamenting that “to top it off,” the Fast and Furious 9 movie release had been delayed.

On his death, one of his former university classmates commented, describing Bachelier as having, even 15 years ago, “a pure libertarian alt-right tendency that in other circumstances I would have abhorred. He was nevertheless a comrade.”

In his suicide note, Bachelier pointed to his reasons for allegedly donating his money to hate groups and extremists, saying:

“This is one of the things that has radically changed about me in the last few years: what happens after I die interests me. This is why I have decided to bequeath my modest fortune to certain causes and certain people. I think and I hope they will make better use of it than I do.”

The incident proved to be a crucial demonstration of the transparency and immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing donations aimed at funding civil unrest in the U.S. to be traced to their original source.

Disclaimer: This investigation relies on Chainalysis accurately identifying Pankakke as the donor of the $520,000 BTC donation.

Disclosure: At the time of press, the author of this piece held Bitcoin.

The U.S.’s easy monetary policy in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis fueled bubbles in countries from Indonesia to Thailand, which burst when the Fed prepared to raise interest rates.The Fed responded to the pandemic with similar policies to those of 2008 but far faster -- and further. Its balance sheet is now near $7.7 trillion, compared to $4 trillion early last year and the previous peak of $4.5 trillion in 2015. That’s equivalent to about 36% of the country’s gross domestic output, a record.There are few economies that can absorb that kind of money. China’s $10.9 trillion equity market and $18 trillion bond market make the country an obvious target.“China is going to be a very attractive place for capital,” said Wen-Wen Lindroth, lead cross-asset strategist for Fidelity International. “The long term growth rate – the gap they have with income – versus developed markets means they have lot more scope to develop,” she said.The question now is how China deals with this issue, which will become even more pressing as the weighting of yuan assets in global benchmarks increases, drawing in billions of extra dollars. Allowing more outflows will reduce the risk of bubbles, but increases the potential for money to flood out too quickly -- as the country witnessed in the wake of the 2015 currency devaluation.“China has long been very careful about opening its capital account, and that cautious approach is still the most probable one,” Wei He, China Economist at Gavekal, wrote in a March 31 report.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","But this time, government officials say that bitcoin mining at cryptocurrency farms — the energy-intensive business of using large collections of computers to verify digital coin transactions — is partly to blame.

Iran’s state-owned electricity firm Tavanir announced Wednesday that it had shut down a large Chinese-Iranian-run cybercurrency center in the southeastern province of Kerman because of its heavy energy consumption. The company reportedly was licensed to operate under a process the government had put in place to regulate the industry.

Alongside pointing a finger at legal operations, Iranian officials have specifically singled out illegal cryptocurrency miners as a strain on the electricity grid spurring outages, Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, a spokesperson for the electricity industry at Iran’s energy ministry, told the IRNA state-run news agency. On Wednesday, Ali Vaezi, a spokesperson for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, said the government would be investigating cases of unlicensed cryptocurrency farms.

But Iranians in the bitcoin industry reject the government’s accusations, saying the industry is being blamed for a broader problem.

“The miners have nothing to do with the blackouts,” Ziya Sadr, a cryptocurrency researcher in Tehran, told The Washington Post. “Mining is a very small percentage of the overall electricity capacity in Iran.”

He added, “It is a known fact that the mismanagement and the very terrible situation of the electricity grid in Iran and the outdated equipment of power plants in Iran can’t support the grid.”

The government itself has pointed to cheap electricity rates, enabled by government subsidies, as another major cause of the blackouts. A member of the board of the Iranian Blockchain Association told IRNA that the electricity used by cybercurrency miners in Iran was estimated to be about equal to the electricity lost by the network during distribution.

The standoff underscores the rocky road ahead for cryptocurrencies that, in theory, could thrive in an economically embattled country such as Iran, where some have welcomed the alternative banking system as a possible way to bypass U.S. sanctions.

And in the meantime, electricity problems persist. In recent days, overstretched power plants have shut down as demand for natural gas to heat homes has soared. Others have reportedly turned to low-grade fuel to keep the strained electricity grid powered. Pollution levels in the capital, Tehran, have hit “very dangerous” levels.

When the lights are working, Iran’s combination of cheap electricity and high inflation has made it an ideal destination for the energy-intensive process of creating, or mining, digital currencies like bitcoin, said crypto expert Ali Beikverdi.

Decentralized cryptocurrencies rely on high-powered computers to verify that transactions are legitimate by solving complicated mathematical problems. Mining units of digital coins is a potentially lucrative business that’s taken off in recent years in Iran, as firms in countries such as China and Russia have partnered with Iranian entrepreneurs to create bitcoin “farms” made up of specialized computers.

“Any country that has cheap electricity and a vast area would be a perfect place for bitcoin mining,” said Beikverdi, who is from Iran and now lives in Seoul, in an interview with The Post. “In Korea, it wouldn’t be profitable because I would have to spend a lot of money on electricity.”

Bitcoin mining had already illegally taken off in Iran by the time the government took notice a few years back. Initially, it cracked down on miners, who used computers and other equipment smuggled in from places like China, said Sadr.

Then in 2019, it passed legislation to regulate the burgeoning under-the-table industry: Miners of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were required apply for a license to operate and import computers and related equipment. Registration enabled the government to provide farms with electricity at a higher rate than the general public.

Sadr said the new legislation disadvantaged those who had already established themselves in the industry, as there was no path to legalize operations running on illegal equipment.

Iranians have reportedly set up bitcoin mining shops in everything from mosques to actual farms to make use of the cheaper electricity rate. The government has offered a reward for information on the locations of illegal operations.

Iran’s government has sought to extend control over the industry in other ways, too. Lawmakers recently passed legislation that would limit cryptocurrencies to be used to finance imports and exports with Iran’s central bank as an intermediary. The law, however, hasn’t been applied in practice, as there’s no system in place for doing so, said Sadr. The government had announced plans to develop its own cryptocurrency, though no significant progress has resulted.

Beikverdi said the allure of cryptocurrencies remained strong for many in a politically and economically embattled country like Iran. The digital trade “has been empowering individuals,” he said. “It kind of helps people do things financially in a broader scale without relying on countries or governments.”

But both Beikverdi and Sadr said cryptocurrencies alone were no match for the U.S. economic sanctions that under the Trump administration became the most stringent yet, cutting off Iran from all kinds of global trade and international banking systems. Since 2018, the U.S. Treasury has sanctioned several Iranians for violating sanctions using cryptocurrencies.

“Bitcoin is not a solution for [U.S. sanctions],” Sadr said. “Bitcoin is just a tool. The sanctions problem is a much bigger problem. It’s a much bigger block for people.”

President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to remove many of these economic sanctions and return to the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump withdrew from in 2018, if he and his counterparts in Tehran can agree on the terms.

Still, Sadr said it would be a long time before any measurable level of international trade could be carried out with Iran using bitcoin, as businesses currently were either not interested or unequipped to work with digital coins.","If there’s one negative aspect to life at record low interest rates, it’s earning almost nothing on the cash you have saved at a bank.

Certificates of deposit, or CDs, which require you to lock up savings for a predetermined amount of time offer slightly better interest rates, but not much better than the paltry 0.07% annual percentage yield (APY) that is the current national average for savings accounts, according to Bankrate.

But one crypto startup, BlockFi, is letting users earn at a rate that’s nearly 123-times higher on dollar-backed cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins. More specifically, the company is currently paying an 8.6% interest rate on savings accounts holding the Gemini dollar, the stablecoin introduced by the Winklevoss twins’ regulated and audited New York trust company Gemini. Interest is paid out monthly by BlockFi in either a dollar equivalent or a favored cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ether.

BlockFi's savings accounts are not FDIC insured, but they do offer interest rates currently 123-times higher than the national average as measured by Bankrate.

“You can start earning your interest and gaining passive exposure into a new asset class,” BlockFi co-founder Flori Marquez explained in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live. “The people who use our products span from everyday consumers who are buying bitcoin for the first time to even some small corporates.”

It’s important to note that the higher interest rates BlockFi offers on its accounts carry a special set of risks. Unlike traditional savings accounts, BlockFi’s are not FDIC-insured, which means they don’t carry the traditional $250,000 of protection per depositor. Even BlockFi’s disclaimer warns customers that their savings account “is not a risk-free product and loss of principal is possible.”

Despite those risks, hundreds of thousands of customers have turned to the Peter Thiel- and Coinbase Ventures-backed platform to either trade cryptocurrencies or earn interest through BlockFi’s savings accounts, according to Marquez.

“As opposed to most fintech platforms, our average account size is actually $50,000,” she said. “So people are depositing... a meaningful amount of assets.”

Story continues

Comparing a $25,000 deposit at Marcus by Goldman Sachs, which offers 0.5% interest rates on its savings accounts, and BlockFi's 8.6% rate shows the difference in expected earnings over a year.

Similar to banks, BlockFi acts as a financial intermediary that’s able to benefit in the gap between borrowing and lending. As Yahoo Finance’s Brian Cheung recently explained in this week’s Yahoo U installment, banks profit by enjoying a larger return on money loaned out than the interest they pay on deposits. As BlockFi CEO Zac Prince explained to Yahoo Finance in the past, the company’s similar role as an intermediary comes with another perk unique to the crypto space: a lack of other established players.

“We're the largest lender of cryptocurrencies to institutional borrowers, who today are primarily market makers and proprietary trading firms that are active in this asset class and have been for a while, but they can't finance that activity with their traditional prime broker relationships because banks aren't active in the space yet,” he said. “That's the reason why the yields are still high, because this is a new asset class. It's nascent, it's growing quickly, and it doesn't have access to the traditional sources of debt capital. And as a result, when we're lending, we're able to charge higher rates, and then we pay that back to the folks who are our clients on the front end.”

As the industry matures, Prince expects that BlockFi will likely have to lower interest rates on its savings accounts at some point, but rates have held at 8.6% for more than a year.

Prince also stressed that interest earned on BlockFi’s accounts are also taxed much like interest revenue from traditional bank accounts, and that BlockFi provides users with an annual 1099 form to help with tax filings.

“We’re heavily regulated at the federal level and at the state level as a financial services company in the U.S.,” he said.

ETH Price Slid Roughly 20% in 24 Hours, but Signs of Recovery Are Showing

The week started with Ethereum (ETH) taking a little of the spotlight from Bitcoin. As of Monday, ETH had fallen nearly 20 percent over the last 24 hours. Mirroring moves by Bitcoin, ETH had actually fallen even further at one point earlier in the day but was showing some signs of recovery.

Was it expected? a number of analysts have been predicting that Ethereum’s high transaction fees and slow transaction speeds would catch up to the network, and the currency, eventually.

Man Has to Figure Out Password to Unlock $240M Worth of Bitcoin

Lastly, we finish on the story of Stefan Thomas who has just two password attempts left before a hard drive containing 7,002 bitcoins lock his account and seize his fortune.

Stefan, who lives in San Francisco, earned his bitcoins as a reward for making a video explaining how Bitcoin works in 2011.

He wrote the password of his IronKey hard drive that holds the credential to his digital wallet on a piece of paper. However, he lost that piece of paper many years ago and since then made eight failed attempt to guess the password to no avail. If he guesses wrong two more times, he will never see the money.

Last week, Bank of America Securities chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett said in a note that bitcoin looks like “the mother of all bubbles.”

Harnett seems to be using the strength and speed of bitcoin’s price rise as the base for his diagnosis, as if that is the main feature of a financial bubble. It isn’t.

Continuing the misuse of the word, in a note quoted on Bloomberg this week, investment management firm Man Group said: “Every time a bitcoin bubble bursts, another grows back to replace it … This very frequency makes the bitcoin narrative somewhat atypical relative to the great bubbles of the past.”

This is less irritating in that Man Group recognizes that bitcoin is “atypical” – but it also seems to believe that bitcoin is a bubble. It’s not.

Words matter

To see why, let’s pull out our financial dictionaries:

Investopedia: “During a bubble, assets typically trade at a price, or within a price range, that greatly exceeds the asset’s intrinsic value (the price does not align with the fundamentals of the asset).”

Related: Blockchain Bites: Coinbase Wants to Crowdsource Asset Listings; What's Up With Tether's Bank?

Nasdaq: “A market phenomenon characterized by surges in asset prices to levels significantly above the fundamental value of that asset.”

Wikipedia: “A situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future. It could also be described as [an asset that trades] at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset’s intrinsic value.”

Do you see the common thread? An asset is in a bubble when its price increase is unrelated to its intrinsic or fundamental value.

Story continues

What is bitcoin’s intrinsic value? Nobody yet knows. We’re looking at a still young technology that is evolving alongside the demand for it. The technology’s future use cases are still unclear, as is its place in the financial ecosystem. And bitcoin’s unique investment characteristics and unfamiliar metrics make it impossible to apply traditional valuation techniques. Many have opinions as to its fundamental value, but you only need to look at the wide range to realize they are based on unestablished theories and untested logic.

So, anyone saying that bitcoin is in a “bubble” is making a judgement call on its intrinsic value. But they never (not that I’ve seen, anyway) share their calculations or even reveal the number that they’re thinking of.

Social concepts

Maybe these analysts and commentators are using the term “bubble” in the social sense?

Economist Robert Schiller defines a speculative bubble as a “social epidemic whose contagion is mediated by price movements.” Those of us that spend time on Twitter or YouTube may be nodding in recognition. But Schiller specifies “epidemic” (an unfortunate metaphor in 2020-21), which implies mainstream participation. The cacophony of bitcoin maximalists and altcoin enthusiasts is far from mainstream.

AQR Capital Management co-founder Cliff Asness gets it. In a 2014 paper written for the CFA Institute, he said: “The word ‘bubble,’ even if you are not an efficient market fan (if you are, it should never be uttered outside the tub), is very overused.”

Suds aside, he goes on to add: “Whether a particular instance is a bubble will never be objective; we will always have disagreement ex ante and even ex post. But to have content, the term bubble should indicate a price that no reasonable future outcome can justify.” (my emphasis)

Most professional investors allocating part of their portfolios to bitcoin are doing so to hedge against the scenario of currency debasement, which seems less and less unreasonable. How do you put a price on that?

What is the “fundamental value” of a good that does not fall in value along with the underlying currency, that does not suffer the consequences of a weak economy, and that cannot be co-opted to provide profit for a select and powerful few? What is the “intrinsic value” of a technology that also allows for the auditable, immutable and censorship-resistant sharing of information? How do you assign a baseline price level to a cryptographic token that embodies all of this, and can also be used as a payment innovation as well as a seizure-resistant emergent store of value?

For bitcoin to be in a bubble, its price movements need to be unrelated to its underlying value. Given the astonishing increase in the global supply of dollars at a time of stagnating demand due to widespread pandemic-induced recessions, and the likely emergence of recovery-fueled inflation which will be difficult to control, it could be argued that bitcoin’s underlying value as a potential offset to the ensuing economic chaos is rapidly increasing. It could be argued that bitcoin’s price movements are catching up to its underlying value.

The anti-bubble

It could also be argued that bitcoin is the anti-bubble, that its price is going up because of bubbles elsewhere in the economy. Many investors are buying bitcoin in response to what they see as a massive sovereign bond bubble, which they believe the government will try to deflate by printing money.

And as for equities, the blistering market valuations of tech companies are to a large degree dependent on low interest rates which could head up fast should the bond bubble burst. This would make “alternatives” such as bitcoin even more attractive.

To get a feel for bitcoin’s anti-bubble nature, try to imagine what its “fundamental value” would be if we had central banks that did not print money, governments that kept balanced accounts and no fear at all of MMT, financial repression or any kind of populist uprisings. In this scenario, demand and price would be much lower than they are today.

So, before we accuse bitcoin of being in a bubble, before we imply that its current price in no way reflects its potential utility in a chaotic and increasingly uncertain world, let’s ask ourselves where we think the drivers of bitcoin’s utility are heading.

None of this means that bitcoin’s price won’t fall – it might, and if it does, it might do so quickly. The likelihood of that is for each investor to decide.

It does mean, however, that we need to examine more than just recent price movements. A strong return does not automatically deserve “bubble” designation. Bubbles are not about prices – they’re about price relative to value.

Labels matter, and what’s coming is going to be confusing enough without charged words misrepresenting new concepts.

Macro currents

When institutional investors praise the current macro environment as being “perfect” for bitcoin, we listen. After all, low rates, a declining dollar, and inflation fears cause investors to deploy low-yielding cash into higher-yielding assets such as gold and bitcoin.

But do these investors go back to the drawing board when BTC plunges more than 20% just as the 10-year Treasury yield breaches 1%? I’m starting to question if the macro narrative of ongoing Fed support suppressing yields and boosting market speculation still holds.

Just like the Fed, investment managers care more about real yields (adjusted to remove the effects of inflation) rather than nominal yields. The fact that real yields are still negative means the inflation outlook is muted. The Fed will continue monetary easing until it sees a meaningful pickup in growth and inflation, which supports the base case for bitcoin as a speculative asset.

And what about bitcoin as a hedge against inflation?

Some might say there’s no evidence of inflation running wild just yet. But market participants would disagree as they position ahead of economic data. We can see this in breakeven rates (a market-based measure of inflation expectations) which exceeded 2% this week.

(The above chart shows the US 10-year real yield struggling to chase inflation expectations higher, which should keep the Fed active – supporting the macro case for bitcoin. )

To be fair, volatility metrics such as Treasury swaption premiums show no hedging bias for a significant move higher or lower in rates. This means volatility in the rates market remains very low, suggesting that investors are not yet demanding greater reward for rising interest rate (or inflation) risk.

So, where can investors find such a reward? Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is attracting greater institutional flows because it yields high returns compared to traditional assets. Bitcoin’s high relative return compensates investors for volatility and inflation risk.

As long as the Fed keeps the punchbowl flowing, the speculative quest for high returns will continue. It’s a goldilocks environment for bitcoin as an asset class.

Investors talking:

· “We have been watching it for a longish time, and our judgement is that it is a unique beast as an emerging store of value, blending some of the benefits of technology and gold. Yes, it is a seemingly non-sensical asset – but one that makes absolute sense for how we see the world.” – excerpt from a beautifully written and thoughtful investor letter from Jonathan Ruffer, chairman of Ruffer Investment Company

· “Every time a Bitcoin bubble bursts, another grows back to replace it … This very frequency makes the Bitcoin narrative somewhat atypical relative to the great bubbles of the past.” – Man Group investment note

· Speaking on CNBC’s The Coin Rush on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs’ global head of commodities research, Jeff Currie, said the cryptocurrency market “is becoming more mature” but still has a way to go, and that he thought that approximately 1% of the current bitcoin market cap was attributable to institutional investors.

In his latest investor memo, Oak Tree Capital founder Howard Marks reveals that his son “thankfully owns a meaningful amount for our family.” He goes on to say: “In the case of cryptocurrencies, I probably allowed my pattern recognition around financial innovation and speculative market behavior – along with my natural conservatism – to produce my skeptical position. … Thus, I’ve concluded (with Andrew’s help) that I’m not yet informed enough to form a firm view on cryptocurrencies. In the spirit of open-mindedness, I’m striving to learn.”

Takeaways:

According to sources, Goldman Sachs is considering launching a crypto custody service. TAKEAWAY: I remember back in the early days, we used to say that Goldman Sachs getting into the crypto business would be the tipping point for institutions. Years later, even with other significant legacy institutions already offering digital asset services, it would still be a very big deal, as it would be the strongest signal yet that Wall Street is interested. It would also trigger a scramble to catch up from other traditional financial institutions, and would incentivize professional fund managers to at least get better informed.

This week, Reuters reported that the incoming Biden administration is expected to name Gary Gensler, a Washington and Wall Street veteran who has closely studied the cryptocurrency field, as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. TAKEAWAY: This is very good news for the crypto industry. Gensler has experience in capital markets, academia and public administration. He served as chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as a key financial regulator for former President Obama, and in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration. More recently, he taught a blockchain and crypto assets course at MIT, has spoken at several crypto conferences, and even penned an op-ed for us in 2019. Gensler sees blockchain as a “catalyst for change,” and seems to have a nuanced understanding of how crypto assets work and the impact they can have on capital markets. This nomination is likely to rekindle the market’s expectation that a bitcoin ETF will get approved this year. (See former CFTC official Jeff Bandman’s take on the reported nomination here.)

Crypto custodian Anchorage has secured conditional approval for a national trust charter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), making it the first national “digital asset bank” in the U.S. TAKEAWAY: The U.S. now has three crypto-native banks, up from precisely zero just a few months ago (crypto exchange Kraken was awarded a special purpose depository institution – SPDI – charter by the state of Wyoming last September, and crypto bank Avanti got one a month later). There are notable differences between the three that are worth pointing out. As a national trust, Anchorage cannot accept deposits, which means that it does not automatically get access to the Fed discount window and payment system. It does, however, make Anchorage a Qualified Custodian under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, and adds another crypto piece to the regulated financial institution puzzle. The more “authorized” financial companies there are in the crypto industry, the greater the level of institutional trust.

New York-based crypto exchange Bakkt, backed by NYSE parent ICE, will become a publicly listed company via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Victory Park Capital. TAKEAWAY: The expected valuation is $2.1 billion, for a pre-product, pre-revenue business. According to a presentation by the Bakkt team to the SEC, the firm expects the size of the cryptocurrency market to reach $3 trillion in 2025 – in other words, it will more than triple in five years.

Gemini Trust, the cryptocurrency exchange and custodian founded by twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, could soon go public, according to a Bloomberg report. TAKEAWAY: It looks like 2020 will see a number of crypto market infrastructure companies go public. There’s Bakkt mentioned above, and other rumored possibilities are Coinbase, BlockFi, eToro, and I’m probably missing a couple. This is great news for us analysts, as we’re excited about getting a look at detailed financials for some of the largest platforms in the industry. It’s also good news for the industry, as these listings are likely to attract mainstream investor attention, as well as give investors an alternative path to cryptocurrency exposure.

Over $3 billion flowed into the products of crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments in Q4 2020, according to its latest report (Grayscale is owned by DCG, also the parent of CoinDesk). Over 90% of this came from institutional investors, mainly asset managers. TAKEAWAY: The report also showed that the Q4 inflows accounted for almost 60% of the year’s total, in spite of most of its funds being closed to new investment for the last 10 days of the year, which highlights the acceleration of institutional interest in crypto assets. Furthermore, the weight of institutional inflow in the mix was notably higher in Q4 vs. the year as a whole. Almost 90% of inflows went into the firm’s bitcoin trust GBTC.

Grayscale has reopened some of the funds it closed to new investment in December of last year, including the bitcoin trust (GBTC) and the digital large cap fund (GDLC). TAKEAWAY: Since Grayscale was responsible for much of the bitcoin purchases in the fourth quarter last year, the reopening could be taken as good news for the market – a buyer that had temporarily left is coming back in.

A prospectus for a new bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been filed by Arxnovum Investments Inc. with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) in Canada. TAKEAWAY: With renewed attention on a potential bitcoin ETF approval in the U.S., the OSC’s actions here could set a precedent – a bitcoin ETF trading on a neighbouring stock exchange could kindle the competitive spirit and help the SEC realize that other jurisdictions are leading the way in financial innovation; on the other hand, a rejection by the OSC could send a signal to the SEC that there’s no hurry.

3iq Corp’s bitcoin fund, listed as QBTC.U on the Toronto Stock Exchange, has reached over CA$1 billion (US$785 million) in market capitalization. TAKEAWAY: This level of growth in an exchange-trade fund that was originally listed in Toronto in April of last year, and on the Gibraltar Stock Exchange in September, underscores the demand for listed bitcoin vehicles.

The bitcoin exchange-traded product BTCE, which started trading on Deutsche Börse’s Xetra exchange in June 2020, now also trades on Swiss stock exchange SIX. TAKEAWAY: The Financial Times reported this week that, BTCE’s daily trading volumes on Xetra averaged €57 million in the first 11 days of January, up from a daily average in December of €15.5 million, which points to surging demand in Europe for listed bitcoin products. The SIX listing takes the number of ETPs trading on the Swiss exchange up to 34, and, according to the exchange, turnover in cryptocurrency products reached CHF 1.1 billion ($1.24 billion) in 2020. This is still tiny in the overall picture (the exchange reported 2020 turnover of over CHF 1.7 trillion, or almost $2 trillion), but if BTCE’s trend on Xetra is anything to go by, that figure is likely to substantially higher in 2021.

The number of financial advisers allocating crypto to client portfolios reached almost 10% in 2020, an increase of almost 50% compared to 2019. TAKEAWAY: This is according to a recent survey carried out by crypto fund manager Bitwise and financial media site ETF Trends (you can see the full report on our Research Hub), which got input from almost 1,000 registered financial advisers. 81% of whom reported that they had received a question from a client about crypto in the past 12 months. This highlights the imperative for financial advisers to at least be able to answer questions about crypto assets – they are doing a disservice to their clients if they can’t, and dismissing something because it’s not easy to understand goes against the ethics of the profession.

Crypto trading platform CrossTower is launching a capital markets desk for institutional clients. TAKEAWAY: This encapsulates two trends we’ve been seeing build up over the past year: 1) the emergence of institutional-grade crypto market services, which widens choice and deepens the comfort level of institutional investors in the crypto markets, and 2) the bundling of crypto-related services and the gradual consolidation of the industry into a few firms that do many things, prime broker-style. Expanding from its spot exchange and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk, CrossTower now offers digital asset lending, trade financing, structured products and trade execution across multiple venues.

Digital asset manager NYDIG – which earlier this week announced the acquisition of crypto data firm Digital Assets Data – is partnering with banking technology provider Moven to offer plugins for banks that want to launch bitcoin products. TAKEAWAY: This is yet another indication that traditional financial institutions are gearing up to enter the crypto asset market, either through custody services, trading platforms, payments or a combination thereof. In an online survey of more than 2,000 U.S. consumers shared exclusively with CoinDesk, NYDIG found that 80% of bitcoin holders would move their crypto to a bank if it had secure storage. Of those same holders, 71% would switch their primary bank account if a bank offered bitcoin-related products and 81% would be interested in buying bitcoin through their bank.

Asset management firm Arca has closed a $10 million Series A round of funding led by RRE Ventures. TAKEAWAY: Arca is one of the more innovative crypto fund managers in the industry. Not only does it manage its crypto fund, but it is also pushing the envelope in terms of financial products and fund management. In 2019, it filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Friday for a bond fund whose shares would be tokenized on the ethereum blockchain. In 2020, it championed the concept of “tokenholder activism,” pushing decentralized exchange and prediction market platform Gnosis to stick to its original mission or return funds to investors. It will be interesting to see what it does with the funds raised in the latest round.

This report by Bloomberg on the Arctic’s first bitcoin mining facility not only has gorgeous photos; it also reminds us that bitcoin does not just exist in cyberspace, and it is not a pure technology play. It has an industrial side, too. TAKEAWAY: The report also reminds us that the heavy power consumption of bitcoin mining is not an industry-killer, as many early critics insisted it would be.

Speaking of mining, Minnesota-based Compute North and New York-based Foundry Digital (owned by DCG, also the parent of CoinDesk) have partnered to provide a “turnkey” hosted mining solution which allows investors to purchase hosted machines through either company. TAKEAWAY: This is a step towards turning bitcoin mining into an investment option with fewer barriers (such as finding a location, buying the machines, etc.). It could also serve as the basis for other types of financial products, such as mining-based collateral and hedging derivatives. Crypto investing is not just about buying an asset and watching the price move.

Babel Finance is letting bitcoin mining firms put up their machines as loan collateral in exchange for significantly better lending terms than those offered for crypto asset collateral. TAKEAWAY: This offers a glimpse at the growing sophistication of the mining industry in China, and the emergence of leveraged operations. On the one hand, more leverage means more risk. On the other hand, leverage will allow for faster industry growth, which leads to even more secure blockchain networks, which leads to more financial inflows, and so on in a virtuous circle.

The venture arm of U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase participated in the seed round of mining software and services company Titan, which in December announced what will reportedly be the first enterprise-grade bitcoin mining pool in North America. TAKEAWAY: This echoes the trend mentioned above of crypto mining facilities being packaged as investment opportunities, and Coinbase’s endorsement of the potential makes it an even more intriguing area to watch.

Las Vegas-based bitcoin mining company Marathon Patent Group (MARA) has entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors for the registered offering of 12.5 million shares of common stock at $20 per share, to raise $250 million. TAKEAWAY: CEO Merrick Okamoto told CoinDesk in an email he intends to use the funds to, among other things, purchase more mining machines and expand facilities amid the ongoing “arms race” as manufacturers struggle to keep pace with demand. The increased activity in “mining as a business” is largely attributable to the rising bitcoin price, which directly affects mining profitability. It also has to do with the growing sophistication we mentioned above, with advances in mining technology that are impacting the economics, and with the growing global competition, which is good for the industry as a whole.

Panama-based crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, the largest options exchange in the industry, has already recorded approximately 25% of last year’s entire bitcoin options trading volume. TAKEAWAY: This is astonishing growth that underlines the market’s growing maturity. The growth is not limited to Deribit, although it is consolidating its position as segment leader. Open interest (OI) across all crypto options exchanges has exploded from just over $520 million a year ago (16% of the OI of bitcoin futures) to over $8.3 billion (66% of the OI of bitcoin futures!) today.

Bitcoin miners selling their holdings is often used to explain market dips, and this week was no different – but the data doesn’t support that theory. TAKEAWAY: The transparency of on-chain data allows us to track outflows from known bitcoin miner addresses to known exchange addresses. This shows that miner outflows to exchanges have been trending down. True, this doesn’t catch off-exchange activity, and the overall balance at mining addresses is down to early 2020 levels, according to the data. But accounts from mining pools support the conclusion that miners are more likely to be selling fewer BTC into the rally, rather than dumping and causing the price to fall.

Investors are increasingly seeking exposure to bitcoin following the recent months-long price rally. Bitcoin exchange-traded products are seeing record trading volumes. Meanwhile, more big banks are reportedly trying to get into the crypto space, including Goldman Sachs.

High Demand for Bitcoin and Crypto Products

With the price of bitcoin rapidly rising over recent months, more investors are seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency. The price of bitcoin rose about 24% since the beginning of the year and over 90% since the beginning of December.

One bitcoin exchange-traded product in particular, BTCE, has recorded an average daily trading volume of $69 million in the first 11 days of January, the Financial Times reported Friday, citing data from Deutsche Börse where it is trading. This week, Switzerland’s principal stock exchange revealed that its crypto trading volume hit a record high of $1.2 billion in 2020. The exchange now lists 34 crypto exchange-traded products.

Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust posted an average daily turnover of almost $1 billion in the first two weeks of this year, which is more than nine times the average in 2020, the publication added. The bitcoin trust’s assets under management grew from $1.8 billion to $17.5 billion during the year.

Meanwhile, Canadian asset manager 3iq says its bitcoin fund has reached a milestone, exceeding one billion Canadian dollars ($785 million) in assets under management. Besides the bitcoin fund, the company offers the ether fund and a global crypto-asset fund.

Big Banks Want In, Including Goldman Sachs

As bitcoin continues to outperform other assets, more major companies are seeking to get into the crypto space. Goldman Sachs’ global head of commodities research, Jeff Currie, said last week that the bitcoin market “is beginning to become more mature” after he called BTC “a retail inflation hedge.” The investment bank is now rumored to be have issued a request for information (RFI) to explore providing digital asset custody service.

The RFI was reportedly sent to a prominent company in the crypto custody niche at the end of last year. An unnamed Goldman Sachs source indicated that the firm is talking to several companies with a focus on custody service.

Recently, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted Anchorage conditional approval to become a national digital bank. Anchorage co-founder Diogo Mónica told CNBC last week that the regulatory approval will attract many large institutional players to begin offering their own crypto services, including custody.

Other banks and financial services giants that have recently entered the crypto space include Spain’s second-largest bank BBVA, Standard Chartered Bank, Southeast Asia’s largest bank DBS, and Italian insurance giant Generali. Some of them offer only crypto custody services while others also offer bitcoin trading services.

“2020, in addition to Bitcoin which takes the dominance in the market, about 73% of the volume, Ethereum definitely comes next. Ethereum is basically a protocol that allows smart contracts, so that a lot of applications can be built on top of it,” Fang said.

Some analysts have speculated that Ethereum’s superior technology will one day lead it to surpass Bitcoin in market value, Fang said that this analysis does not tell the complete story.

“I would disagree, but not [with] the fact that Ethereum has inferior technology than Bitcoin. I think those two are built for very different use cases. They are also in very different stages of development in their life cycle. Bitcoin was built as a store of value,” Fang said. “Ethereum, on the other hand, is built to allow smart contracts, in that people can actually build apps on top of it to really build internet use cases in the crypto world.”","On the back of a record-breaking year in 2020, Bitcoin’s growth has stumbled in recent weeks. But analysts say the cryptocurrency has staying power. With possible continued growth in 2021, responsible regulation and becoming crypto savvy will help to protect and give confidence to investors, experts say.

In 2020, Bitcoin recorded dizzying heights. Early in the year, it fell victim to the global sell-off that accompanied Covid-19 panic and was down 30% in March. But the digital currency rallied, rounding out 2020 up by almost 300%. This has been attributed to bitcoin moving in the same direction as gold. At the time of writing, one bitcoin was worth R556 562.

Although the bitcoin experienced volatility this month — causing some to hark back to its rapid growth in 2017 and subsequent collapse the following year — analysts predict it will continue to grow in 2021.

According to an analysis by financial research firm Investtech this week, Bitcoin is set for even more robust growth rate in the medium and long term.

Earlier this month JP Morgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou bolstered views that cryptocurrency will continue to grow in 2021, projecting that Bitcoin could rise by about 350% above its current levels.

But, Panigirtzoglou noted, for cryptocurrency to match gold as a safe-haven investment it will also have to become less volatile.

Risky business

The volatility of cryptocurrency has long been cause for concern. Unlike other currencies, crypto is created, distributed, traded and stored using a decentralised digital ledger called a blockchain.

In 2014, the treasury warned members of the public about the risks associated with digital assets because they were largely unregulated. Over the years, several scams by third-party bitcoin traders have successfully fooled investors as a result.

The astronomical growth of crypto in 2020 coincided with the widely covered collapse of the illegal Stellenbosch-based bitcoin trading scheme Mirror Trading International (MTI), which saw investors losing in the range of R10-billion.

In its investigation into MTI, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) found that the entity contravened several laws. MTI publicly denied the FSCA’s allegations.

If it’s too good to be true …

Carel de Jager, a lead instructor at Blockchain Academy, which provides training on investing in cryptocurrency, said potential investors need to be savvy when choosing where to put their money.

“If this cryptocurrency of yours or this investment scheme that you are looking to invest in has a company or a person central to it, then you have reason to be cautious,” De Jager said, adding: “If it is too good to be true, then it probably is.”

De Jager suggested people looking to buy or invest in cryptocurrency should do their research before becoming involved with a third-party company. “There is such a lot of information on the internet trying to warn the public about these things,” he said. He added that scammers take advantage of the vague regulations around cryptocurrency.

“The space is a little bit like the Wild West. And unfortunately, by definition, the space can never be as tightly regulated as the conventional investment bank space, because cryptocurrencies are decentralised. They don’t have owners; they don’t have call centres or CEOs or headquarters.”

In the first move to regulate cryptocurrencies in South Africa, in November the FSCA published a draft declaration declaring crypto assets financial products. This means that any person giving advice or rendering intermediary services relating to crypto assets must be authorised as a financial services provider and comply with the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act.

De Jager said: “The FSCA is doing excellent work in trying to protect investors. But the FSCA is not a guardian angel … The responsibility will always rely on the investor to do due diligence prior to investing in these things.”

In response to questions by the Mail & Guardian, head of enforcement at the FSCA Brandon Topham said that while the new regulations may not have prevented what happened at MTI, because “fraud is fraud”, they may have made it easier for the public to know not deal with the firm.

“Unfortunately be it investing in cattle, minerals, crypto, shares, offshore gold holdings, or any other ‘investment’, the public tends to forget that there are certain basic rules to money: If it sounds too good, it is too good. And that greed and stupidity will be rewarded with tears and loss.”

Waiting for regulations

Desiree Reddy, director in the banking and finance practice at Norton Rose Fulbright, agreed that it would be challenging to regulate cryptocurrencies fully and effectively. But it is not impossible, she said.

“Any regulation would need to be capable of continuous development. Because with cryptocurrency, the technology behind it may develop at a pace that is much faster than regulations develop.”

She added that the FSCA’s draft declaration is motivated by the growing interest in cryptocurrency in South Africa and globally. “The regulation being in place is very important. From an uptake perspective, I can’t see that there was as much of an imperative for the regulator to issue regulations up until this point as there is now.”

Marius Reitz, general manager for Luno in Africa, South Africa’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said: “Scammers will always exist. But I think something that will definitely counter this is when we see regulations come to the market … Now consumers will be able to differentiate between a licenced platform and any other platform without a licence.”

Reitz told the M&G this week that he expects that in 2021 the market will see the culmination of various long-term efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies.

It is clear to regulators around the world that Bitcoin is growing and becoming increasingly integrated into existing financial infrastructure, Reitz said.

He said that for Bitcoin’s price to stabilise, it would need a critical mass of people to participate in the market.

“I think a lot of people will be sitting on the sidelines, waiting for regulations — a lot of potential investors. As we see regulations coming into the market, people will have more confidence … When we reach that point globally, we will see more people buying and selling.”","Polkadot Flips XRP to Become the Fourth-Ranked Crypto After Price Spikes 100% in Less Than a Week

Dot, the native token of the Polkadot network, has flipped XRP to become the fourth-ranked token after its price rallied by more than 40% in just 24 hours. Since January 11, the token has now gone up by more than 100% to set a new all-time high (ATH) of $18.06 on January 16.

With its market capitalization currently standing at over $16.8 billion, the Dot token now surpasses that of XRP by over $4 billion. Yet before the December 23, 2020 breakout, the Polkadot token had a market capitalization of just under $4.5 billion and an average price of $4.70, according to data from Markets.bitcoin.com. However, between then and January 3, the token soared by more than 100% to close at $10.35.

Yet, after this initial price surge, the token then briefly stabilized at just under $10.35 before dropping to $7.61 on January 11. Nevertheless, after this short-lived retreat, the token went on another rally that culminated in Dot displacing XRP.

Meanwhile, the displacement of XRP from its fourth position by Dot comes as the former continues to get delisted by exchanges. Since the delistings began, the XRP token has now plunged from the December 17 high of over $0.60 to the current price of $0.28.

Furthermore, in a move that is likely to add more pressure on the token, the Kraken crypto exchange has announced it will halt trading of the XRP token on January 29. However, this move is only expected to affect US customers only.

China’s Blockchain Service Network (BSN) wants to build a universal digital payment network.

The Asian country has taken bold steps towards embracing blockchain technology and digital currencies.

China has begun working on a new blockchain initiative. The project, tagged Blockchain Service Network (BSN), is geared towards integrating international Central Bank digital currencies (CBDC).

According to a recent report, BSN looks to standardize digital currency transfer practices and processes. This means that the network would build a universal digital payment network (UDPN) to ease such transactions.

The report states that it is expected that CBDC projects would drastically change the conventional payment method. Not only that, but these projects would also considerably improve resilience and the international payment system.

BSN is working with different international banks and technology companies to build UDPN. The project is expected to be finished in the next five years, and it is built on the CBDC projects of countries working on one presently.

After the project, the network would allow resources like banking, insurance, mobile applications, and ERP to use the services of UDPN to initiate a digital currency transaction payment process.

The project is still in the design stage, but its beta version is expected to be launched later in the year.

BSN project shows China’s commitment towards a national blockchain and cryptocurrency implementation

While other countries are still reluctant to embrace blockchain technology, China has taken bold steps towards implementing a national blockchain and a digital asset.

Its current BSN project shows that the country is effectively looking at integrating blockchain into everyday economic life. This would considerably ease financial transactions in the country.

The country’s blockchain project is built on the idea that it would allow smart cities, applications, and the digital economy. The government, banks, and technology companies are working hand in hand to ensure the project’s success.",

Bitcoin options worth a record $3.7 billion are set to expire at the end of the month.

The surge in the Bitcoin price has helped the options market expand rapidly.

Investors remain bullish about Bitcoin, according to options data, despite recent volatility.

Sign up here our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

A record $3.7 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire on January 29, as speculation ramps up following the recent volatility in the cryptocurrency's price and growth in interest in its derivatives.

On Monday morning, open options contracts were worth around 245,700 Bitcoin - or roughly $9.1 billion - according to cryptocurrency data analytics website bybt.com.

Bitcoin options are contracts that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the cryptocurrency at a specified price within a set time period. They give investors the chance to make money by betting on which way the price will go, without having to trade the digital currency itself.

Deribit - the exchange that currently facilitates the most Bitcoin options trading - began offering the products in 2018. But interest has risen sharply over the last few months as the Bitcoin price has surged towards an all-time high near $42,000 earlier this month. It stood at around $36,960 on Monday morning.

Options contracts worth around 101,000 Bitcoin - or $3.7 billion at Monday's prices - are to to expire on January 29, bybt.com's data showed, although not every option will result in a trade. That is more than the previous record of around $2.4 billion seen on 25 December, as noted by Cointelegraph.

The options show that speculators are bullish about Bitcoin. As of Monday the open interest in ""calls"" (which are broadly bets that prices will rise) was considerably bigger than the open interest in ""puts"" (bets the price will fall).

""It reflects just how volatile [Bitcoin] has become, even by its own standards, over the last couple of months,"" said Craig Erlam, market analyst at currency firm Oanda.

""The moves we're seeing on a daily basis now are incredible so it's natural that options are being more utilized.""

Bitcoin's price has soared more than 300% over the last year and more than 60% in the last month.

Analysts say central banks and governments flooding economies with cash amid the coronavirus pandemic has been a key driver, while worries about inflation and currency devaluation are also factors.

Yet the Bitcoin price is highly volatile, regularly swinging more than 10% each day. After hitting its record-high of more than $41,000 on 8 January it fell to close to $30,000 a few days later before rising again.

Germany's BTCetc Bitcoin Exchange Traded Crypto has seen trading volumes of more than €50 million ($60 million) per day on average so far this year according to Deutsche Boerse. Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust has also boomed.

Options have also become an increasingly popular way of speculating on Bitcoin. The market has been aided by respected institutions such as CME Group moving in.

Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at blockchain company NEM, said: ""Due to the complexity involved with trading, options volumes give us a good indication of the number of sophisticated investors that have been trading Bitcoin.""

Seamus Donoghue, vice president of sales at digital currency security firm Metaco, said: ""Institutional adoption of Bitcoin should drive continued underlying growth for futures and options volumes.""

Yet Erlam was more skeptical about what the rise in options trading meant. ""The creation and adoption of these instruments is a step forward but doesn't take away from just how highly speculative an instrument it still is,"" he said.

Analysts at JPMorgan last week said Bitcoin may need to break past $40,000 mark again in the near future if the price is to rise further. If it does not pick up soon then ""momentum"" funds that follow trends could force the price lower, they warned.

(Bloomberg) -- The surprise takeover bid for Toshiba Corp. is a palpable demonstration of the growing influence in corporate Japan of activist investors, who have gone from largely impotent onlookers to kingmakers in the space of just a few years.The offer from CVC Capital Partners, while still in the early stages, comes just weeks after Toshiba Chief Executive Officer Nobuaki Kurumatani lost a landmark shareholder vote, forcing an independent investigation into alleged issues with voting at its annual general meeting last year.That loss has piled pressure on Kurumatani, who barely won re-election at last year’s meeting and is seen as unlikely to survive another. The vote was triggered by Toshiba’s largest shareholder, the secretive Singapore-based hedge fund Effissimo Capital Management.Any deal for Toshiba faces legal hurdles, and analysts say that investors such as Effissimo would likely insist on a substantial premium from Tuesday’s closing price. But the episode shows that the influence of activism in Japan is becoming hard to deny.“There have been false dawns before,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “But activism is taking hold now.”Flexing MusclesCVC offered about 5,000 yen per share in its buyout proposal, according to a Toshiba executive. A bid at that level would value Toshiba at about 2.28 trillion yen ($20.7 billion) and represent a 31% premium to its last close before news of the bid emerged, data compiled by Bloomberg show.That would make it the largest private equity-led buyout since 2013, and CVC’s biggest acquisition on record. Toshiba’s board plans to form a special committee to consider the proposal, said the executive, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.While there are many hurdles to a deal taking place, Toshiba shares rose by their daily limit of 18% to 4,530 yen per share at the close in Tokyo.“Considerable value would be created simply by simplifying ownership and clarifying governance by taking the company private,” said Nicholas Benes, an expert on Japanese corporate governance. “Precisely because of that, one would very much hope that this is a case where Toshiba will be open to other bids, by both other PE firms as well as strategic acquirers.”Activist investors have increasingly been flexing their muscle in Japan in recent years, as corporate governance reforms promoting shareholder value have meant management can no longer dismiss such pressure. Tokyo Dome Corp. will be delisted this month after acquisition by a white knight last year to fend off pressure from activist investor Oasis Management Co.Once a storied name in Japan, Toshiba has faded dramatically since its glory days after years of management missteps and scandal. The conglomerate invented flash memory three decades ago, but it was forced to sell most of its prized chip business in 2018 because of losses in its nuclear-power operation. That deal led to an infusion of cash -- but also a large contingent of more vocal shareholders. Last week, Singapore fund 3D Investment Partners became the latest investor to say it may make make proposals to management, boosting its stake to more than 7%.“Any successes of this nature will probably snowball and lead to more activity,” said Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “There is a sense that a large part of Japan’s industrial base is being run inefficiently, resulting in apparent undervaluation of Japanese conglomerates.”Kioxia OptionsOne open question for Toshiba is the future of Kioxia Holdings Corp., its former memory-chip division in which its still holds the biggest stake. Kioxia is focused on going public as soon as this summer in an IPO that could value the business at more than $36 billion, Bloomberg News reported last week. Alternatively, Micron Technology Inc. and Western Digital Corp. are each to be interested in acquiring the firm, the Wall Street Journal reported.If Toshiba secures a reasonable market valuation for Kioxia, and its core businesses attract multiples similar to those of its Japan peers, Thong said he sees scope for over 1 trillion yen of shareholder value creation. That would imply a Toshiba share price of over 6,500 yen per share, while the deal reported by the Nikkei sets the price at about 5,000 yen apiece.Mio Kato of LightStream Research sees a low possibility of the deal going through under current terms, and expects volatile trading for Toshiba’s shares in the near term depending on how things develop. Toshiba’s shareholders, especially activists, will want a rather “steep price,” he wrote in a note published on SmartKarma.Given the sensitivity around several of Toshiba’s bushinesses, including its deep involvement in decommissioning the wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, government approval would be required for the deal, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Wednesday.It’s unclear if a foreign firm such as CVC would be allowed to take control of Toshiba. The relationship between CVC and Toshiba executives -- with Kurumatani a former Japan president and external director Yoshiaki Fujimori still employed by the firm -- has also raised eyebrows.“This could simply be an attempt to buy time for Kurumatani,” Kato said.(Updates with details of bid level from sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Decentralized oracle network Chainlink’s LINK token and other prominent alternative cryptocurrencies (dubbed altcoins) are charting solid gains as the crypto market leader bitcoin takes a bull breather.

Some altcoins such as OMG and OXT are up over 10% in the past 24 hours, while others including ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash have gained at least 2%–8% each.

Bitcoin is currently trading near $36,900, representing a 5% gain in 24 hours, but remains trapped in a week-long tightening range of $30,000 to $40,000. The period of consolidation looks to be paving the way for the rotation of money into the relatively cheap altcoins.

The switch to alts began last week with Polkadot blockchain’s DOT token rallying sharply to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency framework Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin. “Other coins now seem to be following Polkadot higher,” he said.

The record ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread seen earlier this month had suggested a rally in ether and alternative cryptocurrencies in general may be on the way.

Altcoins could continue to “pop hard” while bitcoin is held in a narrowing price range, said market analyst Lark Davis on Twitter.

LINK, the native token of the Chainlink oracle system, has hit a fresh all-time high as bitcoin trades sideways. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole called LINK’s new high at $23.68 (the previous lifetime high of $19.90 was reached in August,) set in overnight trading. LINK is just one of many altcoins that are benefiting from consolidation in bitcoin markets and a rotation of capital into more speculative bets, Godbole reports.

Trilemma dilemma?

MetLife is the latest legacy financial institution to take a hard look at cryptocurrency. In a primer titled “The Blockchain Blockbuster,” MetLife Investment Management (MIM), the life insurance giant’s investment wing, examined the nature of money from “Yapese stones to central bank digital currencies.”

My colleague Will Foxley reported that MIM thinks CBDCs are anything but “a passing fad,” (MIM’s words) and represent the “logical progression of money and technology” (Foxley’s words). “[J]ust as the dreams of cryptocurrency developers tend to be rather lofty, so are those of various CBDC initiatives,” the document states.

The 18-page report, published Jan. 8, didn’t say much more than that. It argued that interest in CBDC development was spurred by the explosion of digital assets unleashed after Bitcoin came on the scene. And concluded by saying “western countries” could potentially look towards China’s digital yuan experiment as a guide. Neither points are really debatable, but debate we must!

There is one smaller point worth examining. While Alexander Villacampa and Jun Jiang, the paper’s authors, appear to think CBDCs and cryptocurrencies can (and will) exist side-by-side, there was a moment of existential conflict. I quote:

“Bitcoin and its ilk are constantly battling to maintain a balance between three key concerns known as the ‘Blockchain Trilemma.’ The trilemma, often visualized as a triangle, consists of three issues related to sustainable public blockchain development: scalability, decentralization, and security. It is assumed in the trilemma that by strengthening any one of the triangle’s vertices, at least one of the others must weaken.”

The “scalability trilemma,” attributed to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is a (often constructive) criticism of blockchain networks. Although it’s fallen out of “the discourse” in recent years – a quick Google search showed that the problem was often used as a marketing tool for blockchains that supposedly solved the issue in 2018 – plenty of smart people are still thinking about it.

Called the trilemma, the concept can actually be reduced even further to a sliding scale of decentralization and centralization, with pros and cons of moving between the two. It posits developers can’t have everything when it comes to efficiency and security. Optimizing for decentralization naturally makes the network slower, though more secure. Centralization reduces security, by introducing a single entity that can be attacked, but improves transaction throughput. Simple enough!

But is it right? In 2018, in the heyday of the trilemma, most people cited Bitcoin and Ethereum’s proof-of-work consensus algorithm (the networks’ security design) as prime examples of how decentralization reduces transaction throughput. Thousands of miners create a secure, but slow, network.

Bitcoin developers are looking at layer 2 solutions, like Lightning, to create a usable payments system out of a secure base, while Ethereum developers are exploring layer 2s and a network overhaul. In many of these instances the solution is moving and processing some transactions off-chain, limiting how much a decentralized blockchain can get in the way.

While it’s clear that the contours of the trilemma are real and should be addressed, the real solution is probably to ignore the framing. The tradeoff between scalability and security is a problem that exists across the payments universe. Bitcoin is cumbersome though accessible to anyone, and Visa is lightning-fast but entirely prone to “financial censorship.”

This isn’t to take the Bitcoin Maximalist view that bitcoin is a store of value and doesn’t need to be a payments system, but it is an admission that there’s room in the world for multiple types of systems that all optimize for different things.

Circling back to CBDCs, as Villacampa and Jiang note, the “expansion of electronic payment systems via blockchain technology that has captured the interest of central banks who believe they are uniquely capable of providing not only a better alternative but also able to lay the foundation for an officially-sanctioned global electronic payments regime.” If that includes researchers that think they’ve solved the “scalability trilemma,” more power to them.

The price of bitcoin and a number of digital assets have been consolidating this week, after a number of crypto markets dropped over 25% the week prior. The entire crypto-economy is hovering just below the $1 trillion mark at $987 billion, gaining 1.3% during the last 24 hours.

Crypto Asset Markets Consolidate

A good number of crypto-asset markets have been meandering about in a state of consolidation, while a few tokens have seen significant gains in recent days. At the time of publication, bitcoin (BTC) has been exchanging hands for $36,400 per unit with an overall market valuation of around $677 billion. BTC’s market cap gives the crypto asset a 66% dominance rating in comparison to all the alternative digital currency valuations in existence. At the current price BTC is up 4% during the last seven days, 54% for the 30-day span, 209% during the last three months, and 324% over 12 months.

Ethereum (ETH) is trading for $1,236 per ether and holds a market valuation of around $141 billion today. ETH traders are still in the green with a gain of 15% during the week, 90% for the month, 239% for the 90-day span, and over 651% during the last year. The stablecoin tether (USDT) holds the third-largest market cap today, but below the tether market is the digital asset polkadot (DOT).

Polkadot now holds the fourth largest market cap today as each token swaps for $17 per unit. Below the DOT market cap is XRP which is currently trading for $0.28 per coin. XRP is down less than a percentage for the week but also down over 50% during the 30-day span.

Cardano (ADA) follows XRP, and each ADA token is trading for $0.37 per unit. ADA has performed considerably well in recent weeks gathering 36% this week. Over the month ADA prices have improved by 108% and 266% during the 90-day span. Litecoin (LTC) is currently trading for $148 per coin and the crypto asset is up over 9% during the seven-day span. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is swapping for $492 per unit at the time of publication jumping over 5% this week. BCH has an overall market cap of around $9.19 billion and has gained 58% in the last 30 days.

‘No Surprise to See Bitcoin Recover Relatively Easily Last Week,’ Accumulation Addresses Rise

While the price of a great number of crypto assets dropped last week, mainstream pundits said that the crypto economy was headed for a bear market. However, crypto analysts disagree with the bear market assessment and BTC’s recovery last week highlighted that things are still very bullish. “Instead of a tumultuous week with talks of crashes and bubbles, last week was relatively steady for bitcoin for the most part,” Etoro’s Simon Peters explained in a note to investors. “Starting at just $30,000, bitcoin rose to $40,000 on Thursday, before dipping again over the weekend. It currently sits at $36,389,” the market analyst added.

Peters continued:

Whilst some commentators have pointed out that, from a technical standpoint, we are currently in a bear market, I don’t personally ascribe to that view. This level of volatility is no different from what we have seen in previous bull runs, but because bitcoin is at such a substantial price, the fluctuations in dollar terms appear much more significant. In percentage terms, they are not. The backdrop for bitcoin remains supportive and so, to myself and to many in the community, it was not a surprise to see bitcoin recover relatively easily last week from its setback.

Meanwhile, one analyst said that BTC has a few days of consolidation and in the interim altcoins will probably see some action. “Three days until bitcoin reaches any ‘relevant’ apex – this means three more days of having fun with altcoins,” Teddy Cleps said to his 51,000 Twitter followers on Saturday.

The CTO at Glassnode explained to his Twitter followers that a large amount of BTC is being sent to “accumulation addresses.”

“2.7 million BTC are held in accumulation addresses– that’s an increase of 17% in the past year,” the Glassnode CTO, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, recently tweeted. “These are addresses that have received at least 2 incoming transactions and have never spend funds. Miner and exchange addresses are excluded,” the researcher added.

After the co-owner of the Atilis Gym in New Jersey appeared on TV and told the public the state confiscated over $173k from the gym owner’s bank account, Ian Smith revealed Atilis Gym has now set up a crypto wallet. Smith explained that a number of people didn’t want to donate using the Gofundme platform, so peer-to-peer electronic cash supporters created a proposal on the permissionless fundraising application, Flipstarter, so people can donate bitcoin cash toward the gym owner’s legal efforts.

Uncensorable Money Advocates Help Atilis Gym Owners

Just recently, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the Atilis Gym in New Jersey owned by Ian Smith and his business partner, Frank Trumbetti. Last week, Smith told the public that New Jersey’s (NJ) Governor Philip Murphy seized the gym’s legal defense funds during the gym owner’s appeals process. The state took $173,613.60 according to Smith, and the Atilis Gym co-owner appeared on Fox News with Tucker Carlson in order to tell his story.

During Smith’s conversation with Tucker, the two discussed accepting cryptocurrencies in order for the gym owners to protect themselves from another form of asset seizure. The Atilis Gym co-owner told Tucker that setting up a cryptocurrency account was a frequent recommendation.

Following the story, Bitcoin.com founder Roger Ver shared a video on Twitter that explains what happened to the Atilis Gym owner’s legal defense funds. Ver further explained in his tweet:

It’s time for the world to switch from censorable banks and Gofundme to uncensorable peer-to-peer electronic cash and Flipstartercash.

Moreover, Ver shared a Flipstarter fundraising link with the video called the “Atilis Gym Patriots Bitcoin Cash Fundraiser.” The Flipstarter fundraiser aims to raise approximately 42 BCH or more than $20k using today’s BCH exchange rates. At the time of publication, the Atilis Gym Flipstarter has raised 24.96 BCH or just over $12k so far.

‘People Take Care of Each Other Way Better Than Big Government Can’

The Atilis Gym co-owner also tweeted about the help his business received from BCH proponents looking to assist the gym.

Ian Smith tweeted on Sunday:

These guys are incredible. They heard about what happened with the illegal asset seizure and helped the Atilis Gym set up a crypto wallet and have started a fundraiser for us. Once again showing that people can take care of each other way better than big government can.

In another tweet, the Atilis Gym co-owner said that a “number of people who wanted to donate to our cause did not want to use the banks or Gofundme.” So @be_cashy set us up a crypto-based Fundraiser. Big shout out to these guys,” Smith added. A number of BCH supporters were thrilled to hear about Atilis Gym being set up with a crypto account and a fundraiser on Flipstarter.

“If you keep your money in bitcoin cash, they can’t steal it,” the BCH supporter David Bond wrote to Smith on Twitter. “You can spend it on gift cards or on Purse.io – offer to pay your lawyer in Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is freedom money,” he added.

The fundraiser creator on Flipstarter explains why the donation portal was created as it serves a dual purpose. “After reading about the unjust treatment of Atilis gym and seizure of their funds by government thugs, we decided to do something about it,” the Atilis Gym fundraiser description on Flipstarter notes. “We’re raising funds for Atilis. Rather than fiat money that can be seized by unaccountable tyrants, we’re talking about non-confiscatable bitcoin cash.”

The Flipstarter description further states:

We’re hoping this fundraiser will serve a dual purpose. First, to help the brave heroes at Atilis who are standing up against unconstitutional and unscientific lockdowns, and second to spread awareness about cryptocurrency. It’s time for people everywhere to drop the banks and take control of their own money. 100% of funds raised will be donated to Atilis.

Individuals can also see a variety of individuals who have already donated to the Atilis BCH fund on Flipstarter. One individual, the BCH proponent, Marc De Mesel, donated a whopping 20.50 BCH to the Atilis Gym’s cause and litigation costs.

“I admire gym guys,” De Mesel wrote after donating. “Courageous to refuse masks and stand up to the police,” the investor added.

Despite lack of regulation, India's crypto exchanges deploy certain KYC and anti-money laundering procedures, but loopholes remain in the ecosystem. Mint explains.

KYC

India has no KYC norms for cryptocurrency. Despite this, India’s cryptocurrency exchanges have come up with their own KYC procedures for users. “As a matter of course, we ask for ID and address proof like Aadhar and PAN Card. We also insist that money must come from the concerned user's bank account and not some third-party account,"" said Nishal Shetty, CEO, WazirX, India’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Exchanges use methods such as penny drop to conduct KYC. For instance in penny drop a token amount like 1 rupee is transferred to the user’s account to verify account details. The penny drop system reveals the account holder’s name as registered with the bank, to the transferor. Most large exchanges follow a roughly similar KYC system, with more rigorous checks for corporates. “For corporate clients who are given higher trading limits, more documents like articles of association, board resolutions authorizing crypto investment etc are needed"", said Neeraj Khandelwal, co-founder, CoinDCX.

Blacklisting of crypto addresses

Most cryptocurrency exchanges use software such as Chainlink to identify rogue addresses. “We use a globally renowned crypto AML tool to check for blacklisted crypto addresses. If a legitimate user has got crypto from such an address, maybe through peer-to-peer and he or she wants to transact on our exchange, we ask for additional KYC such as source of funds and profession,"" said Khandelwal.

However, an exchange CEO admitted on condition of anonymity that the basis of blacklisting by blockchain analytics firms and software is opaque and does not have any legal basis in India. “However there is no standardization and some players use this as a pretext to block withdrawals,"" said Gaurav Dahake, CEO, Bitbns, a Bengaluru based cryptocurrency exchange.

Unlike financial assets like FDs, stocks and bonds, bitcoin and other cryptos are not held in bank or demat accounts. They can be held outside crypto exchanges in what are called ‘cold wallets.’ These are hardware devices or even paper and are not connected to the internet. As a result they cannot be easily seized by law enforcement authorities. Bitcoin and other cryptos can also be directly traded between users without any intermediary or exchange acting as go-between. The two parties only have to know each other’s public keys (crypto addresses).

“Individuals trading cryptocurrency through the P2P (peer-to-peer) mode run a much higher risk of getting funds or cryptocurrency derived from crime,"" said Dahake. “Peer to peer route cannot be stopped due to the decentralized nature of Blockchain. However, all transactions are also publicly available on the blockchain. So if someone wants to cash out of crypto, the funds will ultimately reach a crypto exchange, and this is the opportunity for law enforcement to catch hold of those performing any nefarious activities using crypto,"" said Shetty.

According to cryptocurrency professionals, investors can reduce the risk of ending up with dirty money or bitcoin from criminals if they transact through exchanges rather than peer-to-peer.

The New York-based firm witnessed ""unprecedented investor demand,"" and its assets under management (AUM) rose by more than 10 times to $20.2 billion last year, according to a recent digital asset investment report. The last quarter of 2020 was especially pivotal to Grayscale's operations, accounting for approximately $3.3 billion in inflows. That figure is equal to roughly 58% of the year's total investments and nearly half of the $7 billion lifetime flow of investments into Grayscale's products.

Last year, investors poured money into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), an open-ended trust that provides indirect exposure to Bitcoin and trades on over-the-counter (OTC) markets. GBTC's AUM jumped to $17.5 billion from $1.8 billion at the start of 2020. According to the digital asset investment report, investors plowed an average of $217.1 million on a weekly basis into the trust.

Besides GBTC, Grayscale has seven other trust holdings of cryptocurrencies, including ones for Ethereum (ETHUSD) and Litecoin (LTCUSD), and a digital large-cap fund. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust pulled in an average of $26.3 million per week last year, while other single-asset focused products had weekly average inflows of $33.6 million. The sum total of investments flowing into these products totaled $1 billion for the entire year.

Key Takeaways Crypto investment firm Grayscale has reported record assets under management for 2020 as the pandemic shutdown increased macroeconomic instability.

The increase in trading of GBTC shares parallels Bitcoin's price trajectory last year.

The increase in Grayscale's AUM is a function of its attractive share premiums and critical place in the fledgling crypto economy.



Institutional investors accounted for 93% of all investments flowing into Grayscale's funds. ""There's no longer a professional risk of investing in the digital currency asset class,"" Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, told CNBC. ""There's probably more career risk in not paying attention to it."" According to Sonnenshein, the surge of inflows into Grayscale was primarily a result of investors rotating out of gold, the traditional safe haven from market mayhem, and into Bitcoin, which is positioning itself as digital gold.

""The kind of inflows that we are reporting should be evidence that investors are not waiting for an ETF to begin participating in this asset class,"" he said, referring to the prospect of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that might provide investors a cheaper way to access Bitcoin.

The increase in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's AUM last year paralleled Bitcoin's Brobdingnagian price trajectory. After a multi-year slump, Bitcoin price shot up from around $7,000 in January 2020 to surpass $40,000 by mid-December on the back of macroeconomic instability due to rising government debt from the pandemic shutdown and greater interest from institutional investors. Other cryptocurrencies also came along for the ride, and the market cap for crypto markets blew past the $1 trillion mark.

As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $36,247.73, roughly unchanged in the past 24 hours. The overall market cap for cryptocurrency markets stands at $1 trillion, with Bitcoin's valuation accounting for 66.3% of that figure.

Grayscale and Cryptocurrency Markets

The figures for AUM for GBTC have increased even during serious drawdowns in Bitcoin price. For example, Grayscale reported an AUM of $359.5 million, or nearly three times the figure recorded during the 2017 digital asset bull market, in 2018. By 2019, that figure had advanced to $607.7 million. Bitcoin price crashed and subsequently moved sideways for most of those two years. The latest surge in AUM is simply a continuation of previous year trends, although it differs in scale and extent.

In its digital asset investment report, Grayscale wrote that the latest figures for GBTC inflows are ""further evidence of institutions looking to Bitcoin as a reserve asset."" But that is a misleading statement. Investment into GBTC does not provide direct ownership of Bitcoin. Rather, it is a method to generate short-term profits off the cryptocurrency's wild price swings without the associated ownership fees and custody costs.

The increase in GBTC's AUM is a function of the fund's structure and its critical position in the crypto economy. The fund creates shares in private placements, and redemption is only available to investors through public markets. They cannot redeem their shares for actual Bitcoin and are subject to a mandatory share lockup period of six months. This practice increases liquidity for GBTC shares in secondary markets and creates price volatility.

Based on SEC filings, Grayscale issued almost 3.5 billion shares in GBTC alone in 2020. The number of Bitcoin per GBTC share available to investors has declined over the years. It was 0.09242821 in 2017 and is 0.00094950 in January 2021.

According to Capital IQ, the top three holders of the fund's shares are crypto lending firm BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, and Horizon Kinetics. The last two are hedge funds based in Singapore and New York, respectively. BlockFi offers attractive interest rates in exchange to investors depositing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on its platform. On the backend, it lends the Bitcoin to other players in crypto markets, notably GBTC. The volatility in GBTC's price provides the lending firm with a ready source of liquidity to meet its customer commitments.

In addition to cash, GBTC investors can use in-kind purchase mechanisms to purchase shares. This means they can purchase the fund's shares by borrowing Bitcoin from a lending firm like BlockFi and contributing to GBTC's overall Bitcoin holdings. After the lockup period, they sell the shares at a premium to another investor and purchase the Bitcoin back. To hedge their position, the investors also open short positions against Bitcoin at futures platforms like the CME.

The absence of regulatory clarity regarding Bitcoin custody for institutional and retail investors also meant that Grayscale cornered the market for those seeking to profit off their Bitcoin purchases. According to Bybt, a cryptocurrency derivatives data platform, GBTC's Bitcoin holdings jumped by approximately 346,400 in the past year.

Not surprisingly, JPMorgan strategists wrote last month that Grayscale is key to Bitcoin price because inflows into its funds outpace investments into Bitcoin or its associated funds by momentum traders. But that dominance may not last long. Grayscale is facing new competition from the likes of Bitwise and Osprey, which promise similar services at lower costs.

Clarity around custody regulation and the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF approval may also eat into Grayscale's business. In addition, not all investors may be able to stomach the price volatility and the rapidly fluctuating premium of GBTC shares over Bitcoin price.","In this photo illustration, a visual representation of digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is arranged on a circuit board of a hard drive.

Bitcoin and U.S. tech stocks are viewed by investors as the biggest market bubbles right now, according to a Deutsche Bank survey released Tuesday.

The survey, which is based on responses from 627 market professionals between Jan. 13-15, found that the vast majority of investors (89%) think some financial markets are in bubble territory.

Out of those bubbles, bitcoin and U.S. tech shares are top of the list. Bitcoin is viewed as a more extreme case, with half of respondents giving the cryptocurrency a rating of 10 on a 1-10 bubble scale.

U.S. tech stocks were seen as the next largest bubble, Deutsche Bank said, with an average score of 7.9 out of 10 and 83% of respondents giving it a tech bubble rating of 7 or higher.

Investors also think that bitcoin and electric car manufacturer Tesla are more likely to fall than rise over the next year.

""When asked specifically about the 12 month fate of Bitcoin and Tesla — a stock emblematic of a potential tech bubble — a majority of readers think that they are more likely to halve than double from these levels with Tesla more vulnerable according to readers,"" Deutsche Bank said.

Bitcoin has been on a wild ride during the past few months. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value rallied to an all-time high of nearly $42,000 just two weeks ago before slipping sharply. It is up more than 800% from March 2020 lows, when the cryptocurrency cratered on the back of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.","Why did this happen?

Please make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading. For more information you can review our Terms of Service and Cookie Policy.","There has been a lot of talk about Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, being a 'digital' gold. Similar to gold, there is a finite amount, it is not backed by any sovereign and no single-entity controls its production. But for Bitcoin to be considered in a portfolio and to become an investable asset, similar to gold, the asset would need to improve the risk/return profile of that portfolio. This seems a tall order, argues Gerald Moser.

While it is nigh on impossible to forecast an expected return for bitcoin, its volatility makes the asset almost ""uninvestable"" from a portfolio perspective. With spikes in volatility that are multiples of that typically experienced by risk assets such as equities or oil, many would probably throw the cryptocurrency out of any portfolio in a typical mean-variance optimisation.

While Bitcoin's correlation measures are relatively supportive, it seems to falter when diversification is most needed.""

Poor diversifier

And while Bitcoin's correlation measures are relatively supportive, it seems to falter when diversification is most needed, such as during sharp downturns in financial markets. Looking at weekly return correlations since 2016 shows that bitcoin is not strongly correlated with any assets (see below). It is however only second to US high yield in its correlation with equities. US Treasuries, gold and US investment grade were better diversifiers than bitcoin when it comes to equities.

Source: Bloomberg, Barclays Private Bank

Furthermore, looking at global equity corrections since 2015 (see below), it is noticeable that bitcoin has performed even worse than equities over the last three corrections. And while gold and fixed income provided some relief during those corrections, bitcoin compounded the loss that investors would have incurred from equities exposure.

Source: Bloomberg, Barclays Private Bank

The fact that cryptocurrencies also fluctuate alongside equities suggests that investment in bitcoin is more akin to a bubble phenomenon rather than a rational, long-term investment decision. The performance of the cryptocurrency has been mostly driven by retail investors joining a seemingly unsustainable rally rather than institutional money investing on a long-term basis.

Several studies around market structure have shown that emerging markets with high retail/low institutional participation are more unstable and more likely subject to financial bubbles than mature markets with institutional participation. And while more leading financial houses seem to be taking an interest in cryptocurrencies, the market's behaviour suggests that the level of institutional involvement is still limited. Another issue is around its concentration: about 2% of bitcoin accounts control 95% of all bitcoins.

In summary, difficulty to forecast return, lack of diversification and high volatility makes it hard to consider bitcoin as a standalone asset in a diversified portfolio for long-term investors.

An inflation hedge?

Another point widely quoted in favour of cryptocurrencies is that they provide an inflation hedge. This might be a valid point, if inflation stems from fiat currency debasement. As mentioned above, a currency's worth comes from the trust economic agents have in it. If unsustainable amounts of debt and large money creation shatter belief in sovereign-backed currencies through spiralling inflation, cryptocurrencies could be seen as an alternative.

Regardless of its price, Bitcoin's production is set on a precise schedule and cannot be changed. If oil or copper prices go up, there is an incentive to produce more. This is not the case for cryptocurrencies. In a very specific and highly hypothetical scenario of all fiat currency collapsing, this could be positive. But other real assets such as precious metals, inflation-linked bonds or real estate usually provide a hedge against inflation.

Other considerations

Bitcoin's technology should theoretically make it extremely secure. As there is no intermediary, each transaction is reviewed by a large number of participants which can all certify the transaction. However, there have been frauds and thefts from exchanges. Another point to consider is the risk of ""losing"" bitcoins. According to the cryptocurrency data firm Chainanalysis, around 20% of the existing 18.5m bitcoins are lost or stranded in wallets, with no mean of being recovered. As there is no intermediary, there is no backup for a lost bitcoin.

From a sustainability point of view, adding cryptocurrencies to a portfolio will make it less green. Mining and exchanging them is highly energy intensive. According to estimates published by Alex de Vries, data scientist at the Dutch Central Bank, the bitcoin mining network possibly consumed as much in 2018 as the electricity consumed by a country like Switzerland. This translates to an average carbon footprint per transaction in the range of 230-360kg of CO 2 . In comparison, the average carbon footprint of a VISA transaction is 0.4g of CO 2 .

Beyond energy use, the mining process generates a large amount of electronic waste (e-waste). As mining requires a growing amount of computational power, the study estimates that mining equipment becomes obsolete every 18 months. The study suggests that the bitcoin industry generates an annual amount of e-waste similar to a country like Luxembourg.

Here to stay

Innovation in digital assets continues rapidly and will likely drive increased participation, both from retail and institutional investors. The underlying blockchain technology behind bitcoin was meant to disrupt a few different industries. While results have not lived up to the initial hype, more sectors are investigating the use of the technology.

And with Facebook announcing a stablecoin, or a cryptocurrency pegged to a basket of different fiat currencies, central banks have accelerated the movement towards central bank digital currencies. Those could improve payment systems resilience and facilitate cross-border payments.

The Russian cryptocurrency exchange Livecoin has shut down amid accusations that it has pulled an exit scam. Customers are unable to withdraw their funds and have been asked to provide extensive identifying information which they fear would lead to identity theft. The exchange claims that it was hacked in December.

Livecoin Crypto Exchange Closes Down

The Russian cryptocurrency exchange Livecoin announced Saturday the decision to close down its platform.

The exchange claimed in December that it was hacked. As news.Bitcoin.com reported, hackers supposedly manipulated the prices of several major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin whose price shot up to $500K on the platform. Since the incident, users have been trying to get their funds out of the exchange with no success, which has led many to believe that the platform’s operator pulled an exit scam.

The announcement, posted on the Livecoin website in English and Russian on Saturday, reads:

Our service has been damaged hard in technical and financial way. There is no way to continue operative business in these conditions, so we take a hard decision to close the business and paying the remaining funds to clients.

‘Suspect’ Requirements to Get Money Back

To receive a refund, customers have been asked to send a request with their name and registration date to an email address provided by Livecoin. Users have two months to file a claim, and March 17 will be the last date that requests will be accepted.

Once customers email the initial request, the exchange says they will receive “detailed instructions” on how to verify their claims. Livecoin stated that payments will only be sent after customers pass a “verification procedure.” While some users insist that Livecoin never replied to their emails, those who received an email back have shared the verification procedure on social media, which has seven steps for customers to complete in order to qualify for a refund.

The first is for users to provide details of their first deposit on the exchange. One user argued, “My account is from 2017, it is impossible to know my first deposit.” Many others share the dilemma, emphasizing that they can no longer log into their Livecoin accounts.

In addition, customers must provide a “high resolution scan” of their passport or identity card, proof of address, detailed information of the device used to log into the Livecoin account, as well as details of the origin of their funds. Furthermore, the exchange also asked for a “Selfie with opened passport of identity card” and a video verification.

Users Cry Exit Scam and Possibly Identity Theft

One user tweeted to Livecoin: “I got [the] email but why [are] you asking [for] too much documents like you want to open a bank account with my name. I can’t understand why you are doing this.”

Another voiced the same concern, asking Livecoin, “Why do you collect so much data for a refund?” adding that with such data anyone can take out large loans. A third opined, “they ask too much and some unnecessary info which is suspicious.” A fourth user wrote:

This information they ask for is suspect, virtually no user will be able to recover their funds with this information.

Livecoin’s customers on Twitter are angry and worried that they will not be able to get their money back from the exchange. Furthermore, adding insult to injury, Livecoin’s notice warns: “In case of abuse and threats in conversation, the claim can be declined.” One Twitter user concluded:

They exit scammed … our money is gone forever and they want our identities too, to get loans with those.

(MTRX:TSXV RACMF:OTCQB) (the “Company” or “Loop”), a provider of contactless solutions and artificial intelligence (“AI”) to drive real-time insights, enhanced customer engagement, and automated contact tracing to the brick and mortar space, is pleased to announce the final integration of major cryptocurrency payments into the Company’s contactless payment platform. Initial integration was prepared in 2018, with patents filed in 2019 and put on standby in anticipation of today’s global commerce and regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency payments.



The methods described in the 2019 patent application provide a unique method of facilitating and verifying cryptocurrency payments, all performed with the fundamental Loop principle of not requiring POS integration to achieve these goals.

Loop Insights CEO Rob Anson stated: “Whereas many companies try to use cryptocurrencies as a buzz word, Loop has been way ahead of this global paradigm shift to the delight of our customers and partners who want be ahead of what we anticipate being a parabolic growth decade for cryptocurrency transactions and payments. Our Fobi device is already configured to accept leading cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, providing retailers with new long-term opportunities for growth and Enterprise partners with an even stronger value proposition that already includes our world-leading artificial intelligence-driven, real-time transaction technology.”

LOOP’S CRYPTOCURRENCY PAYMENT PROCESSING KEEPS PACE WITH RECENT SHIFT BY WORLD’S LARGEST COMPANIES AND PAYMENT PROCESSORS

COVID-19 accelerated the demand for contactless payment solutions, while the recovery and new all-time highs in cryptocurrency prices accelerated the pace of change in financial services, with consumers around the world adopting and demanding the ability to transact in digital currencies.

Loop Insights enables traditional brick and mortar retail clients and global enterprise partners to maintain or accelerate their leadership positions by easily accepting payments in the massive, growing cryptocurrency space, which has seen significant growth in both merchants and payment processors accepting cryptocurrencies including:

AT&T became the First Mobile Carrier to Accept Payment in Cryptocurrency

Microsoft accepting cryptocurrency on their website and Xbox store

Visa recently filing a cryptocurrency system patent

PayPal and Venmo accepting cryptocurrency for all online payments

Square’s Cash App launching a Bitcoin Auto Payments Tool

HOW IT WORKS

Loop’s Fobi device will create a unique QR code that can be printed or displayed to a customer, allowing them to send payments through a mobile wallet application such as those designed to support leading cryptocurrencies. The platform will then communicate with the retailer, depositing the sum in either cryptocurrency or local FIAT currency. Because the Fobi platform is not dependent on any individual cryptocurrency, customers are free to use whichever cryptocurrency they prefer, using the mobile wallet of their choice.

Furthermore, Loop’s Fobi device provides incredible flexibility and currency risk mitigation by allowing the retailer to decide whether they would like to receive a FIAT currency or hold the cryptocurrency used in payment for future use. Moving forward, Loop will continue to work with leading cryptocurrency exchanges such as Kraken, BitFinex, and Binance to convert payments made in cryptocurrency into local FIAT currencies.

Loop Insights CTO Casey Matson-DeKay stated: “I have been involved in crypto since 2012 and recognized the need for hardware-based solutions to enable digital payments, particularly cryptocurrencies. Through the power of Loop’s Fobi device, we are able to instantly process cryptocurrency payments, confirmed by the retailer through our platform, allowing consumers to use contactless payment options such as cryptocurrencies at additional retail locations.”

In an interview with Bloomberg, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of the exchange, said they were open to the idea of going public. ""We are watching the market and we are also having internal discussions whether it makes sense for us at this point of time,"" said Cameron Winklevoss, president at Gemini.

While analyst firms and publications have made revenue estimates about its competitor Coinbase, not much is known about Gemini's financials. The company recently increased its headcount to 350 employees and announced that it had surpassed $10 billion worth of digital assets under custody. The Winklevoss brothers are the outfit's main investors.

Key Takeaways Crypto exchange Gemini's co-founders have said they are considering the possibility of going public

Not much is known about Gemini's financials, but the company has launched several initiatives over the years to attract customers, retail and institutional, to its platform.

If the New York-based exchange does decide to tap public markets, then it will become the third crypto business to do so in recent times. Coinbase, North America's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has already filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an IPO. Bakkt, a crypto trading platform backed by NYSE owner Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE), went public with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) last week at a valuation of $2.1 billion.

A Good Time to Go Public?

Part of the reason for public listings of crypto businesses is a change in circumstances in their markets. After multiple years of a slump, bitcoin (BTCUSD) prices skyrocketed past $40,000 this year, breaching its earlier record of $20,000. Retail investors were supposed to have driven past price increases in cryptocurrency markets, but news reports are crediting institutional participation for the latest surge. This means that there is more liquidity in crypto markets as compared to the 2017 bull run, making them less susceptible to wild swings.

The infrastructure and capabilities for crypto exchanges have also advanced, making it possible for them to incorporate a wider variety of customers and trades. Macroeconomic instability and integration of digital currencies into public and private ventures have also bumped up the price of Bitcoin.

For crypto businesses like Gemini, these developments should translate to greater revenue. The exchange has announced partnerships in the past to encourage retail transactions using crypto and launched specific products, such as custody solutions, targeted at institutional investors. In the absence of public data or cost estimates, however, it is difficult to guess whether these initiatives have moved Gemini's revenue needle.

Meanwhile, the exchange announced the launch of yet another product to boost its revenue and user numbers. The Gemini credit card is the crypto equivalent of a regular cashback credit card in which customers will get up to 3% back in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for every purchase. To store the cryptocurrency, customers will have to create accounts on Gemini's cryptocurrency exchange, thereby boosting its user numbers.","If you buy, trade, or earn from crypto in any way, it is important that at least you acquaint yourself with how these activities are likely to impact your tax obligations.

In many jurisdictions now, including the U.S., revenue agencies are more than developing a keen interest in the value that investors generate from cryptocurrencies. They are setting up systems that will help them determine what you should report when you file your tax returns.

How the revenue authorities tax your crypto-related activities is based on how they have chosen to treat cryptocurrencies and other assets created on the blockchain.

Cryptocurrencies are not currencies

It is almost indisputable that when Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin, he intended it to be a digital currency. One that is used as a store of value, unit of account, and a medium of exchange. This is how those who embraced cryptocurrencies continue to see them.

However, revenue authorities have chosen to see cryptocurrencies as something else. The Internal Revenue Service, in particular, has opted to treat cryptocurrencies as property for taxation purposes.

If the IRS treated Bitcoin as just another currency, you wouldn’t have to worry about paying taxes when converting your value in crypto into fiat and vice versa. It wouldn’t also matter to the tax collector if you paid for goods and services using a cryptocurrency.

Initially, the IRS, like many other revenue authorities around the world, ignored Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It seemed to them to be something existing in the virtual world’s less-visited part and had little to do with the real world mainstream financial system.

However, as more value was generated, more people got involved, and they moved the value between crypto and the fiat financial system, the revenue agency had to find a way to tax the activities involved.

Cryptocurrencies are property

In April 2014, the IRS released a special notice classifying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as property for taxation purposes. This meant that they were going to be treated the way stocks and real estate are treated.

When you sell stocks you’ve been holding, what is taxed is the difference between the cost at which you acquired them and the price at which you dispose of them (the fair market value).

If the fair market value of crypto assets is higher than the acquisition cost, the difference is taxed. For example, if you bought a bitcoin on Sept. 10, 2020, for $10,000 and sold it on Jan. 9, 2021, for $40,000, the difference will be $30,000. You will be expected to pay the percentage of the difference to the tax collector.

On the other hand, if the fair market value is lower than the acquisition cost, then the difference is considered a capital loss, and you could qualify for tax-deduction when this turns out to be the case after disposing of the asset. That means if you bought a bitcoin at $10,000 and sold it at $$8,000, then you are not expected to pay but declare a loss that can be deducted from other taxes you may be expected to pay.

This is a very simplified description of how cryptocurrencies are taxed. There are more complex activities in the space than buying, holding, and selling.

For example, some people don’t buy the cryptocurrencies they sell, but they “mine” them, in short they have powerful computers that solve the cryptographic maths confirming transactions and are rewarded with new coins as a result. There are also those involved in things like yield farming. All these calls for a nuanced approach to crypto taxation.

The taxation of events emanating from mining, peer-to-peer lending, yield farming, and airdrops is the focus of our next post.

For now, let’s look at two fundamental concepts you need to know to understand how you are likely to be taxed or how you are expected to file your returns.

Capital gains/losses

This is the difference between the cost you incurred to acquire the property and what you get when you dispose of it. In the first example above, we have a capital gain of $30,000. In the second example, we have a capital loss of $2,000.

The concept also applies when you use the cryptocurrency you were holding to make purchases. For example, if you bought a car using bitcoin, the capital gains or loss is the difference in the bitcoin price when you acquired them and the market price when you used them to buy the car.

A taxable event

This is a transaction that involves you disposing of a property like bitcoin and, as a result making a capital gain or a loss.

When you sell cryptocurrency on an exchange for fiat, that qualifies as a taxable event. If the selling price is more than the acquisition cost, you are supposed to report gains.

Also, buying or selling one cryptocurrency for another is considered a taxable event. The difference in the value in dollars can be a capital gain or loss. If you used bitcoins to buy a car, that could also qualify as a taxable event.

There are, however, transactions that are not taxable events. For example, when you move your cryptos from one wallet to another or move them into a wallet on a trading platform.

Time determines tax paid on gains

The amount of tax you pay on your capital gains also depends on how long you’ve held the property. If you acquired a bitcoin and then disposed of it within a year, your capital gains are going to be taxed under your marginal tax bracket.

On the other hand, if you’ve held the property for more than a year, then your capital gains will be taxed under a different regime, which often charges a lower percentage.

In a second article, we will look at how complex cryptocurrency transactions such as mining, lending, airdrops, and yield farming are likely to be treated for taxation.

But Bitcoin’s rise has been joined by some other cryptocurrencies running higher – most importantly, the number 2 crypto Ethereum. In the last week alone, ETH has jumped by over 20%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been hovering around $35K. While there is never a shortfall of industry people willing to predict the price of Bitcoin, either higher or lower, below CI has received some comments from digital asset industry insiders sharing their opinions on Ethereums renewed popularity.

Seamus Donoghue, VP of Sales and Business Development at METACO, notes that Bitcoin has been capturing all of the headlines from $10K in October to over $40K in January:

“Ethereum has been largely unmentioned which is surprising given that over the same period ETH has rallied from $350 to a new all-time high over $1400. In other words, both have seen a 400% rise but there has been no fanfare for Ethereum. While 2020 saw Bitcoin outperform all other cryptocurrencies – driven in large part by institutional adoption – the emerging theme in 2021 seems to be broadening interest in the wider “alt-coin” market.”

Donoghue says that as the second-largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum has significantly outperformed Bitcoin since the beginning of 2021 rising by 100% versus a mere 27% rise by BTC:

“As Bitcoin consolidates in the $40-35K region, retail investors are likely returning to the market with the new onramps provided by firms such as PayPal, these investors are moving “out the risk spectrum” into the broader crypto market. Institutional investors are also likely quiet participants in the rally; although Bitcoin is viewed as a macro inflation asset, ETH has the potential to be the foundation for a new decentralized capital market infrastructure. New protocols such as Cardano and Polkadot are also vying for the foundational infrastructure play but whatever the merits of their protocols need to overcome the significant developer mindshare and network advantage Ethereum currently has. It is early days but the entire sector is looking cheap compared to Bitcoin.”

Donoghue adds:

“Ethereum breaking through its all time highs opens up the possibility of a significant spike higher and further outperformance versus Bitcoin. As investor excitement accelerates, it is likely that the trend of ETH outperforming BTC by 3:1 could continue, and could result in significantly more fireworks and headlines for ETH–$2000 to $3000 is not out of the realm of possibility for ETH by the end of the quarter.”

Konstantin Richter, CEO and founder of Blockdaemon said:

“With the excitement surrounding a new all-time high from Ethereum, it still does not overshadow how far the protocol, DeFi ecosystem built on it, and contributors have come. Even with the ongoing transition to Proof-of-Stake and growing pains of making sure Eth2.0 progresses accordingly, Ethereum continues to prove itself as a tidal wave of innovation surrounding programmable money.”

Richter says that Ethereum has seen incredible levels of developer adoption and its core infrastructure has evolved massively since its last all time high in 2017, when it reached $1,432.

“The network is also undergoing its own “halving” type event, similar to that of Bitcoin last May. This will lead to the throttling of liquidity due to the bonding periods required in the transition to Eth2.0, and is likely to lead to further price surges in the short to medium term due to demand shortages. Bitcoin has doubled in price since 2017, and it appears to be on a similar bull run now even as Bitcoin reaches a temporary plateau. I believe Ethereum could reach double its all time high in the long term, as the network progresses along in its journey to Eth2.0”

Richter believes that Ethereum is “considerably highly undervalued.”

Luis Cuende, Co-Founder of Aragon, states:

“When thinking about what the Web3.0 vision provides, institutional investors will recognise that although sovereign digital currency (BTC) is central, the importance of a programmable economy (ETH) should not be underestimated. In the same way that I predicted ETH would hit $1,000 back in 2017, I believe we will see it bounce between $2,500 and $7,500 this time around. With that said, ETH fundamentals are as robust as ever. Ethereum has actually found early product-market fit, and the protocol is making revenue. ETH is definitely maturing as an asset, and I expect ETH to reach $3,000 during this market.”

Cuende states the success of Ethereum and ERC20 tokens are intertwined and while competitors are making progress, he thinks it is very unlikely that these erstwhile challengers will overcome the network effects that Ethereum maintains:

“However, until Eth2.0 is fully functional, Polkadot, Cosmos and NEAR are well positioned to capture a meaningful market share. If you think about Eth 1.0, it’s a “world computer” that can run relatively complex logic, but right now Eth 2.0 is quite limited. Smart contract support isn’t available yet, and it will be a long way until it is. Still, the promise of Eth 2.0’s impact in scaling Ethereum’s product-market fit shouldn’t be dismissed either.”

Craig Russo, the co-founder of Polyient Games, says the current narrative and value for ETH is the DeFi market:

“ETH serves as a relatively stable method to gain exposure to the overarching DeFi market, which undoubtedly has captured investor attention over the past year. Recent insights from Grayscale Investments LLC indicate that a wave of institutional investors moved to gain exposure to ETH in 2020, and the impending launch of CME Group’s cash-settled futures market for ETH should further drive this trend. At Polyient, we actively monitor a number of different metrics across the ERC-20, and increasingly ERC-721 markets, as leading indicators for the direction of ETH price action. While Bitcoin has sufficiently carved out its own place as a stand alone digital asset, with strong narratives that tie in with macroeconomic trends, Ethereum continues to be home to more exploratory concepts and innovations. If the Ethereum experiment were to fail, it would be difficult for the larger cryptocurrency market to recover. Ethereum is currently limited by its scalability, but the network effects are strong enough to outweigh the limitations. This is especially true when it comes to DeFi, a market that is driven by large investors who are less impacted by network congestion and high transaction fees.”

Russo believes that ETH is looking very bullish and could enter a new phase of “USD price discovery:”

“This is important to note, as the ETH/BTC ratio is substantially lower than where it stood during the previous bull run. With a far more favorable fundamental profile this time around, we believe ETH will begin to make up ground against BTC.”

Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of Stablehouse, points to Bitcoin as a gateway crypto and Ethereum is the logical next step for investors to diversify their crypto holdings:

“The Ethereum network has one of the largest ecosystems, as most stablecoins, DeFi protocols, and other Dapps operate on it. This gives the price of ETH enormous potential for growth, however, scalability issues have held it back thus far. I believe that any traction in sustainable scaling will propel Ethereum to new highs, with $2000 largely feasible in the next few months. Ethereum correlation to the success of the broader market is high, but is also tied to a vibrant and growing ecosystem that takes advantage of its existing network effect. It is unlikely that competitors, such as ADA or DOT will overtake ETH in the short run, although I do believe that Ethreum’s scalability concerns need to be addressed. Otherwise, ETH will certainly be at risk of losing its market share in the long run.”

Bekhazi expects to see a much higher price for ETH following the outcome of ETH2.0.",,"Why did this happen?

At last check, shares of bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain Inc. RIOT, -9.54% were down by about 14%, while rival Marathon Patent Group Inc. MARA, -9.99% was seeing its shares down 17% in Wednesday midday trading.

The three-session slide for both companies comes as bitcoins on CoinDesk BTCUSD, -3.24% were down 7.2% so far this week, and valued at $34,096 on Wednesday.

The slump in bitcoins comes as incoming President Joe Biden’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday suggested curtailing the use of cryptos, which she said are prone to be used for malfeasance.

“And I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that money laundering doesn’t occur through those channels,” Yellen said.

Bitcoin miners are particularly sensitive to swings in the price of the crypto.

Miners like Marathon and Riot Blockchain, play a key role in maintaining bitcoin’s self-sustaining network, running the decentralized software that verifies transactions.

Digital mining refers to the use of high-powered computers to generate new units of the cryptocurrency, by solving complex problems that have become harder over the years by virtue of how bitcoins were originally encoded.

Shares of those companies can be even more volatile than bitcoin by some measures.

Marathon Patent Group shares are up 1,715% over the past 12 months, while those for Riot have surged 1,414%, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin prices, comparatively, are up 287% over the past 12-month period.

Higher prices for bitcoins can justify the high cost of mining for new coins but when prices retreat mining stocks tend to see outsize moves lower as well. Currently the daily profit from one bitcoin miner is $10.68, according to mining-calculator site BTC.com.

Wild swings in prices for bitcoin and other cryptos make miners particularly risky investments.","Disclosure

Bitcoin fell as much as 11% on Thursday after a report from BitMEX Research suggested that a critical flaw called ""double spend"" had occurred in the Bitcoin blockchain.

Double spend is a highly feared scenario where a user is able to spend their bitcoins more than once.

Ultimately, a double-spend event did not actually occur, according to the CTO of Bitfinex.

Bitcoin fell as much as 11% on Thursday, hitting its lowest level in nearly three weeks, as the popular cryptocurrency was hit with a double whammy that jolted faith in its user base.

First, Janet Yellen, President Joe Biden's nominee for treasury secretary, suggested during her confirmation hearing on Tuesday that lawmakers ""curtail"" the use of Bitcoin because of its use in illicit activities.

And second, a debunked report from BitMEX Research on Wednesday suggested that a critical flaw called ""double spend"" had occurred in the Bitcoin blockchain.

Double spend is when someone is able to spend the same bitcoin twice. It is a feared and dire scenario for the digital asset, and the blockchain was thought to have solved the issue when Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper in 2009.

Early attempts to launch a digital cash system were ultimately halted by vulnerabilities that could have enabled double spending and undermined faith in the system.

BitMEX Research tweeted that ""it appears as if a small double spend of around 0.00062063 BTC ($21) was detected.""

BitMEX later said it appeared that the double spend was actually an RBF transaction, which is when an unconfirmed bitcoin transaction is replaced with a new transfer paying a higher fee. But BitMEX's Fork Monitor said that ""no (RBF) fee bumps have been detected.""

BitMEX said in another tweet: ""A transaction in the losing chain sent 0.00062063 BTC to the address 1D6aebVY5DbS1v7rNTnX2xeYcfWM3os1va, and a transaction in the winning chain which spent the same inputs only sent 0.00014499 BTC to this address.""

Ultimately, the double-spend event did not occur, according to Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino. In an e-mail to Insider, Ardoino explained, ""In fact, what happened is that two blocks were mined simultaneously. As a consequence, there was a chain reorganization, which did not result in double-spending.""

Meanwhile, institutional investors continue to gain exposure to bitcoin. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday said BlackRock had enabled two of its mutual funds to invest in the cryptocurrency.

In a statement, the company said it was beginning a program that would allow employees to defer portions of their salaries into bitcoin, bitcoin cash, or Ethereum.

Sequoia will partner with a third-party payroll processing firm to withhold taxes and convert the remainder into cryptocurrency, which will be held in a digital wallet administered by the payroll processor.

“We are excited to offer the members of our team this new benefit. Many of our employees are enthusiastic supporters of cryptocurrency, and we are happy to help them gain exposure to this trillion-dollar asset class,” chief executive officer Richard Stroupe said.

“Cryptocurrency has emerged as an important alternative to traditional investments like stocks and bonds,” Stroupe said. “We’re proud to give the members of our team the ability to easily invest in cryptocurrency and build their savings.”

In a statement, Sequoia cited a recent effort by offensive tackle Russell Okung of the Carolina Panthers to receive a portion of his salary in bitcoins.

In December, Okung tweeted “Paid in bitcoin” after he reached an agreement with the team to have part of his base salary diverted to a third-party mobile payment company to purchase bitcoin investments. However, a spokesperson for the NFL said it was inaccurate to say Okung was being paid in the cryptocurrency.

“The clubs pay the players in U.S. dollars. What the players or his agents do with the money is up to them,” the spokesperson said.

Bitcoin has fallen 10% in the last two days after touching a record high of $40,000 earlier this month. On Tuesday, Janet Yellen, President Joe Biden’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, said Congress should consider curtailing cryptocurrencies, citing “terrorist financing” and money laundering.

“Cryptocurrencies are a particular concern. I think many are used, at least in a transaction sense, mainly for illicit financing,” Yellen said.","Janet Yellen thinks it is important the U.S. considers the benefits of cryptocurrencies along with the potential for misuse.

The Treasury Secretary nominee said that while cryptocurrencies can be used to finance terrorism and other illicit activities, they also have the potential to “improve the efficiency of the financial system,” according to a written response to the Senate Finance Committee.

“I think we need to look closely at how to encourage their use for legitimate activities while curtailing their use for malign and illegal activities,” she wrote. “If confirmed, I intend to work closely with the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking and securities regulators on how to implement an effective regulatory framework for these and other fintech innovations.”

The written remarks, first published by Bloomberg, diverge slightly from her verbal response to a question about potential crypto use in terrorist financing, asked by Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.). At the time, Yellen called crypto a concern, saying she believes many are being used “mainly for illicit financing.”

These appear to be her first public comments on the cryptocurrency ecosystem since 2018, when she said that in her view many transactions were “illegal, illicit transactions.”

Yellen testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday ahead of a possible vote on her nomination. She has previously served as Chair of the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, and has been a long-time economist.

During her confirmation hearing Tuesday, she said the U.S. would have to distribute more aid in the form of unemployment relief and support for public servants and local governments.

“Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big,” she said in her opening remarks. “In the long run, I believe the benefits will far outweigh the costs, especially if we care about helping people who have been struggling for a very long time.”","Cars drive on an unlit street during a blackout in Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Jan 20, 2021.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s capital and major cities plunged into darkness in recent weeks as rolling outages left millions without electricity for hours. Traffic lights died. Offices went dark. Online classes stopped.

With toxic smog blanketing Tehran skies and the country buckling under the pandemic and other mounting crises, social media has been rife with speculation. Soon, fingers pointed at an unlikely culprit: Bitcoin.

Within days, as frustration spread among residents, the government launched a wide-ranging crackdown on Bitcoin processing centers, which require immense amounts of electricity to power their specialized computers and to keep them cool — a burden on Iran’s power grid.

Authorities shuttered 1,600 centers across the country, including, for the first time, those legally authorized to operate. As the latest in a series of conflicting government moves, the clampdown stirred confusion in the crypto industry — and suspicion that Bitcoin had become a useful scapegoat for the nation’s deeper-rooted problems.

Since former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from Tehran’s nuclear accord with world powers and re-imposed sanctions on Iran, cryptocurrency has surged in popularity in the Islamic Republic .

For Iran, anonymous online transactions made in cryptocurrencies allow individuals and companies to bypass banking sanctions that have crippled the economy. Bitcoin offers an alternative to cash printed by sovereign governments and central banks — and in the case of Iran and other countries under sanctions like Venezuela, a more stable place to park money than the local currency.

“Iranians understand the value of such a borderless network much more than others because we can’t access any kind of global payment networks,” said Ziya Sadr, a Tehran-based Bitcoin expert. “Bitcoin shines here.”

Iran’s generously subsidized electricity has put the country on the crypto-mining map, given the operation’s enormous electricity consumption. Electricity goes for around 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in Iran, compared to an average of 13 cents in the United States.

Iran is among the top 10 countries with the most Bitcoin mining capacity in the world — 450 megawatts a day. The U.S. network has a daily capacity of more than 1,100 megawatts.

On Tehran’s outskirts and across Iran’s south and northwest, windowless warehouses hum with heavy industrial machinery and rows of computers that crunch highly complex algorithms to verify transactions. The transactions, called blocks, are then added to a public record, known as the blockchain.

“Miners” adding a new block to the blockchain collect fees in bitcoins, a key advantage amid the country’s currency collapse. Iran’s rial, which had been trading at 32,000 to the dollar at the time of the 2015 nuclear deal, has tumbled to around 240,000 to the dollar these days.

Iran’s government has sent mixed messages about Bitcoin. On one hand, it wants to capitalize on the soaring popularity of digital currency and sees value in legitimizing transactions that fly under Washington’s radar. It authorized 24 Bitcoin processing centers that consume an estimated 300 megawatts of energy a day, attracted tech-savvy Chinese entrepreneurs to tax-free zones in the country’s south and permitted imports of computers for mining.

Amir Nazemi, deputy minister of telecommunications and information, declared last week that cryptocurrency “can be helpful” as Iran struggles to cope with sanctions on its oil sector.

On the other hand, the government worries about limiting how much money is sent abroad and controlling money laundering, drug sales and internet criminal groups.

Iranian cryptocurrency miners have been known to use ransomware in sophisticated cyber attacks, such as in 2018 when two Iranian men were indicted in connection with a vast cyber assault on the city of Atlanta. On Thursday, British cybersecurity firm Sophos reported it found evidence tying crypto-miners in Iran’s southern city of Shiraz to malware that was secretly seizing control of thousands of Microsoft servers.

Iran is now going after unauthorized Bitcoin farms with frequent police raids. Those who gain authorization to process cryptocurrency are subject to electricity tariffs, which miners complain discourage investment.

“Activities in the field are not feasible because of electricity tariffs,” said Mohammad Reza Sharafi, head of the country’s Cryptocurrency Farms Association. Despite the government giving permits to 1,000 investors, only a couple dozen server farms are active, he added, because tariffs mean Bitcoin farms pay five times as much for electricity as steel mills and other industries that consume far more power.

Now, miners say, the government’s decision to close down major Bitcoin farms operating legally seems designed to deflect concerns about the country’s repeated blackouts.

As Tehran went dark last week, a video showing industrial computers whirring away at a massive Chinese cryptocurrency farm spread online like wildfire, prompting outrage about Bitcoin’s outsized thirst for electricity. Within days, the government closed that plant despite its authorization to operate.

“The priority is with households, commercial, hospitals and sensitive places,” said Mostfa Rajabi Mashhadi, spokesman of Iran’s electricity supply department, noting that illegal farms sucked up daily some 260 megawatts of electricity.

Although Bitcoin mining strains the power grid, experts say it’s not the real reason behind Iran’s electricity outages and dangerous air pollution. The telecommunications ministry estimates that Bitcoin consumes less than 2% of Iran’s total energy production.

“Bitcoin was an easy victim here,” said Kaveh Madani, a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, adding that “decades of mismanagement” have left a growing gap between Iran’s energy supply and demand.

Bitcoin “mining’s energy footprint is not insignificant but these problems are not created overnight,” he said. “They simply need one trigger to spiral out of control.”

A sharp drop in supply or spike in demand, like this winter when more people are staying home because of the coronavirus pandemic, can upset the balance of a grid that draws mostly from natural gas. Authorities reported that households have increased their heating gas usage by 8% this year, which Tehran’s electric supply company said led to “limitations in feeding the country’s power plants and a lack of electricity.”

Sanctions targeting Iran’s aging oil and gas industry have compounded the challenges, leaving Iran unable to sell its products abroad, including its low-quality, high-sulfur fuel oil known as mazut. If the hazardous oil isn’t sold or shipped it must be swiftly burned — and it is, in 20% of the country’s power plants, according to environmental official Mohammad Mehdi Mirzai. The smoldering fuel blackens the skies, particularly when the weather cools and wind carries emissions from nearby refineries and industrial sites into Tehran.

During the power blackouts, thick layers of pollution coated mountain peaks and hovered over cities, with readings of dangerous fine particulate pollution spiking to over 200 micrograms per cubic meter, a level considered “dangerously” unhealthy.

As the government publicized its clampdown on Bitcoin farms, miners balked at all the blame over their energy guzzling. Many warned that despite its potential to become a cryptocurrency utopia, Iran would continue to fall behind.

“These moves harm the country,” said Omid Alavi, a cryptocurrency consultant. “Many neighboring nations are attracting foreign investors.”

BlackRock has authorized two of its funds to invest in bitcoin futures, according to filings released Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The move allows exposure to cryptocurrencies for clients of the world's largest asset manager for the first time.

The $8.7 trillion asset manager said it could use bitcoin derivatives, among other assets, under the BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

The funds are only permitted to trade cash-settled bitcoin futures, meaning the holder will receive a simple cash credit once the contract expires. Such settlements do not require physical delivery of the underlying asset.

More specifically, BlackRock's two funds will trade only in those bitcoin futures that trade on exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. At present, the only exchange registered to do so is the CME.

Bitcoin scored an all-time high above $41,000 earlier this month, driven largely by record amounts of money being pumped into economies by governments and central banks to aid relief from the coronavirus crisis. The token was trading around $33,181 on Thursday - a drop of almost 6% on the day.

BlackRock reported assets under management of $8.68 trillion as of December 31. In December, CEO Larry Fink noted that the world's most popular cryptocurrency is seeing giant moves on a daily basis and could possibly unfold into a global market.

Rick Rieder, the firm's chief investment officer, told Bloomberg shortly after that there is a clear demand for bitcoin and that ""it's going to be part of the asset suite for investors for a long time.""

Not everyone is a fan of cryptocurrencies. US Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, who previously was head of the Federal Reserve, said earlier this week bitcoin and the like were ""mainly"" used for illegal activity and their use should be curtailed.

Such hope. Such optimism. Such change…

Unlike his predecessor, President Joe Biden wasted no time between the elections and today, and he is completely prepared to hit the ground running.

His entire cabinet and key roles have already been nominated and are currently going through the congressional confirmation process. In addition, Biden is planning on signing no less than 15 executive orders this evening.

This sort of aggressive early agenda is nearly unprecedented in modern times, so anyone who thought that change might be gradual was gravely mistaken. He is certainly not living up to his nickname “sleepy Joe.”

The stock markets are also greeting the new president with a grand salute. The Nasdaq 100 index is leading the way, with nearly 2% gains in the first two trading hours.

Yellen dollar, Yellen bitcoin

The U.S. dollar, on the other hand, is perfectly flat. The currency markets don’t seem too eager to actualize the optimism into actual pricing.

The words uttered by former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen yesterday leave much to ponder. Her statements on China revealing the political agenda of the administration she’s about to serve was also a stark reminder that we’re no longer dealing with the apolitical Fed chair that we once knew.

Yellen’s words on the U.S. dollar also rang clear. The statement that she would not deliberately debase the USD as a strategy to promote American exports is not surprising.

Just about every administration since that of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower has promoted a strong dollar. After all, the greenback is by far America’s greatest export.

Still, she made no mention, nor was it really asked, whether or not she might act to actually strengthen the buck. In the above statement, she merely mentioned that she wouldn’t push the dollar off a cliff, yet made no mention whether she might act to try and stop it from falling off by itself, or even being pushed for that matter.

Normally this might be interpreted as a good sign for bitcoin and the digital asset space, were it not for a different statement Yellen made specifically about cryptocurrencies. …

This isn’t a remarkably different stance than her predecessor, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, took. Mnuchin even tried pushing through sour crypto regulation at the very end of his term but, unlike Yellen, he didn’t have the backing of the U.S. House.

Even if former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler is a FinTech genius, Yellen will outrank him when it comes to legislation.

Such dip

What’s more, the trend line that we managed to remain above for the last five weeks has now been clearly punctured.

The dotted yellow line here will be drawn slightly different by every chartist, but it would be a stretch for any to claim that it hasn’t been broken today, a fact made even more unnerving by the fact that the 200-Day Moving Average (blue line) is still below $16,000.

As we know, past performance doesn’t indicate future results. For what it’s worth, I haven’t closed anything so far in my high-risk crypto-only portfolio. There are so many notable levels of support immediately below that it would prove difficult for even a large sell wall to penetrate them.","Bitcoin tumbles as much as 11.3 percent on Thursday, sliding below $31,000.

Bitcoin closed in on the lowest in three weeks as the cryptocurrency’s sizzling rally gives way to pessimism that prices are too high.

Bitcoin tumbled as much as 11.3% Thursday, sliding below $31,000. The largest digital asset has trended lower ever since breaking through $40,000, and losses have accelerated in the past two days.

While soaring crypto prices fueled a speculative mania among the Robinhood crowd, it’s also made professional investors reluctant to buy at the top. Prices are still more than double the levels from early November and some technical analysts have argued that a retracement is overdue. It last traded below $30,000 on Jan. 4.

“Bitcoin has already achieved the fastest-ever price appreciation of any must-have asset,” wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists John Normand and Federico Manicardi in a report on Thursday. “Current prices are so far above production costs that mean-reversion lower in returns is a recurring concern.”

Bitcoin was down 7% to $32,467 as of 2:32 p.m. in New York. Prices are on track for their first back-to-back weekly decline since early October.

Adding to the anxiety, a report in a trade blog suggested that there had been what’s known as a double purchase, where the same “coin” is used in two separate transactions. Industry veterans downplayed the notion.

“This is part of the normal operation of the blockchain to allow for a highly parallel system,” said Jacob Illum, chief scientist at researcher Chainalysis. “Occasionally, the Bitcoin blockchain will have competing mined blocks, but only one chain-forming from competing blocks will be accepted by the network.”

However, should a double spending event actually occur, it would be a cause for concern in the market, according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Chart patterns suggest the market is consolidating within a “bullish pennant” formation, according to Matthew Weller, head of research at Gain Capital Group LLC. A sharp move higher could push prices above $50,000, while a break lower would point to a deeper retracement below $30,000, he predicted.

“It would likely take a more severe drop to erase the established uptrend,” Weller wrote in a note.

Despite the selloff, Wall Street hasn’t lost interest in the new asset class. On Wednesday, BlackRock Inc. filed paperwork to add Bitcoin futures as an eligible investment in two funds, the first time the money manager is offering clients exposure to cryptocurrency.","Bitcoin (BTC), up 300% in the past 12 months, ether (ETH), up 700% in that time, and other top cryptocurrencies are on a dramatic bull run, driven by institutional investment and buy-in from big payments companies—and the fervor is bringing renewed attention to cryptocurrency regulation.

So, how might the Biden administration handle cryptocurrency? The answer depends on which member of the administration you examine. (President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris themselves have said next to nothing about crypto.)

Biden’s choice of Gary Gensler for SEC chairman was hailed by crypto flag-wavers as great news for the space. Gensler, former chairman of the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission), taught a 12-week course on cryptocurrency at MIT Sloan in Fall 2018 (“Blockchain and Money”), and has testified before Congress about cryptocurrency multiple times.

In a 2018 hearing in front of the House Agriculture Committee, former Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson said that cryptocurrency “seems like a Ponzi scheme” and asked, “What’s behind this?” Gensler responded, “There’s really nothing behind gold either... Bitcoin is a modern form of digital gold.”

That is exactly what bitcoiners want to hear, especially as they have pushed the “digital gold” use case in the face of criticism that bitcoin isn’t really used as currency, and it certainly makes Gensler sound like a crypto believer.

In a 2019 op-ed for CoinDesk, Gensler also doubled down on the future potential of blockchain technology: “The potential this technology to be a catalyst for change is real... This last point – crypto and blockchain technology acting as a catalyst for change – may not fulfill the heightened expectations of maximalists, but may be [Satoshi] Nakamoto’s most enduring early contribution.”

But Gensler has also said that he views both Facebook’s Libra token (recently rebranded to Diem) and Ripple’s XRP token as securities, and that they should be regulated as securities by the SEC. That could spell bad news for Ripple and XRP holders in the lawsuit the SEC filed against Ripple on previous SEC chair Jay Clayton’s second-to-last day in office. The SEC action labels Ripple’s sales of XRP as unregistered securities offerings based on the agency’s Howey Test, and Gensler’s commentary in 2018 suggests he agrees: “Ripple Labs sure seems like a common enterprise... Ripple is doing a lot to advance the value of XRP.” (Ripple cofounder Jed McCaleb sold off $8.7 million worth of his XRP holdings this week.)

Story continues

In the 2019 CoinDesk op-ed, Gensler also said that crypto exchanges have not yet been “appropriately brought within public policy frameworks,” a sign that he wants to see more regulation of exchanges. As SEC chair, Gensler will find himself in a position to bless or delay the imminent IPO of crypto exchange Coinbase.

More regulation is already in the works, from other agencies than the SEC.

Last month, FinCEN (the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) proposed new customer information-gathering rules for crypto wallet providers. Companies like Square, Coinbase, and Kraken all voiced their displeasure. The discussion around increased regulation has highlighted a philosophical divide between Wall Street investors who welcome and cheer more regulation and early libertarian-type bitcoiners who initially gravitated toward the space because the lack of government interference appealed to them.

This month, the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) granted a federal banking charter to crypto custodian Anchorage; three other crypto companies have applied for charters from the OCC since November: Paxos, BitPay, and Protego.

Biden’s choices for his financial regulator review team, the group advising the new president on his regulator appointments, also cheered crypto flag-wavers.

The group includes Reena Aggarwal, Chris Brummer, Simon Johnson, and Lev Menand.

Aggarwal is a Georgetown finance professor who has moderated panels on crypto and is a big believer in the potential of blockchain. Brummer is a Georgetown law professor who hosts a fintech podcast (“Fintech Beat”), edited an academic textbook on crypto assets and regulation, and testified before Congress about Libra token (he was not a fan, calling it a “failure”). Simon Johnson is an MIT Sloan professor who co-authored a book on blockchain’s potential in global finance. Lev Menand was an advisor to former Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Raskin, and helped lead the push for the development of a U.S. digital dollar.

And then there’s Janet Yellen.

The former Fed chair, now Biden’s pick for Treasury Secretary, has said in the past that she is “not a fan” of crypto (JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon used very similar phrasing in November) because of its use in financing illegal activity. She also said it’s “not a stable store of value and it doesn’t constitute legal tender.”

In her confirmation hearing on Jan. 19, Yellen again said cryptocurrencies “are of particular concern... many are used for illicit financing.”

None of that sounds like good news for bitcoiners, but Yellen said in 2014 that the Fed “doesn’t have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way,” and that financial regulators should not “stifle innovation” when it comes to crypto. She is not likely to think the Treasury has jurisdiction over crypto, either.

Crypto regulation in the U.S. will depend far more on the SEC, headed up by crypto expert Gensler, the OCC, where acting comptroller Brian Brooks was a huge friend to crypto but has stepped down, and the CFTC, where no replacement has yet been named for Heath Tarbert, who has been pro-crypto and announced in December that he plans to step down this year.

Square's bitcoin bet is paying off"
2021-01-22,"Bitcoin is up more than 260% over the past 12 months – a stellar ride – yet owning the asset is fraught with risks including wild swings in cryptocurrency prices. But there are several ways for investors to get a piece of the bitcoin boom without investing directly in bitcoin.

Several companies that are cashing in on bitcoin’s rise are publicly traded, including Galaxy Digital, the cryptocurrency investing firm run by bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz, a top bitcoin bank called Silvergate and bitcoin mining firm Riot Blockchain. Investors who want exposure to bitcoin can also buy the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

There’s also lots of excitement about an upcoming IPO: Coinbase, a top bitcoin exchange, is set to go public later this year. And many more established companies, such as PayPal, are benefiting from the bitcoin bump.

“There are ways to get exposure to bitcoin without owning bitcoin,” said Daniel Polotsky, CEO and founder of CoinFlip, a bitcoin ATM that lets users buy cryptocurrencies with cash.

To be sure, crypto-related stocks can be volatile despite the dramatic increase in demand for bitcoin over the past year.

Earlier this week, for example, Janet Yellen — President Joe Biden’s pick for Treasury Secretary — made skeptical comments about cryptocurrencies and sparked another sell-off. That comes shortly after a strategist at Bank of America dubbed bitcoin euphoria “the mother of all bubbles” And there have been recent stories of investors losing their crypto wallet passwords, leaving them unable to access their bitcoin.

Banks and other financial firms gain from bitcoin boom

Bitcoin-related stocks are also unpredictable and can sometimes plunge even on good news. That’s because their prices are so closely tied to bitcoin prices.

Silvergate, which reported earnings Wednesday after the market closed, plunged nearly 15% Thursday. That might be excessive given that the bank noted that its digital currency deposits more than doubled in the fourth quarter to $5 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter.

“2020 was a year of significant growth and expansion for our business…as investment in digital currencies increased among the institutional investor community,” said Silvergate CEO Alan Lane in a press release.

Lane is referring to the fact that high-profile money managers such as Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and Anthony Scaramucci have all embraced bitcoin as of late.

The interest from well-known money managers is a main reason why Mike Venuto, portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, a fund that invests in bitcoin and blockchain technology companies, owns Silvergate.

Venuto, who also holds Galaxy Digital in the fund as well as bitcoin miners Riot Blockchain, Marathon Patent Group and Hive Blockchain, said he’s looking for the pure-play companies in crypto that stand to benefit the most from bitcoin’s rise.

“These are more mature companies with real financials,” Venuto said.

Their stock prices have fluctuated wildly recently along with bitcoin. But Venuto dubbed the miners the “picks and axes” of the industry — companies that should do well as long as bitcoin prices head higher.

His fund also owns larger blue chip stocks that are benefiting from surging bitcoin demand.

Venuto likes Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, because it is also the majority owner of Bakkt, a crypto futures trading platform. Bakkt announced earlier this month it plans to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company named VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings.

PayPal and Square could be big crypto winners

And Venuto’s fund also invests in digital payment giants Square and PayPal, which now allow users to trade bitcoin. BTIG fintech analyst Mark Palmer upgraded PayPal’s stock to a “buy” on Thursday, citing the company’s recent move into crypto as the main motivation.

Palmer said in a report that PayPal’s cryptocurency business could add more than $1 billion to the company’s annual revenues by next year and that the payment platform “is poised to play a leading role in promoting the acceptance of crypto” for both investors and merchants.

The bitcoin bonanza should help Square along with MicroStrategy, a software company that recently made waves by saying it was putting some of its corporate cash into bitcoin.

These stocks could be better bets for investors not comfortable mining cryptocurrency themselves, said Hong Fang, CEO of OKCoin, a cryptocurrency exchange.

“Look at Square: A lot of its growth is from its bitcoin business,” she said. “Square is now a crypto stock, to be honest.”

That’s another reason some think crypto-related stocks could continue to benefit. More big money managers may join so-called mom and pop investors and scoop up shares in companies such as Square, PayPal and the upcoming Coinbase IPO.

That makes the recent bitcoin spike different from the surge more than three years ago, said Alda Leu Dennis, general partner of Initialized Capital, a venture capital firm with a stake in Coinbase.

“The 2017 bitcoin runup was driven more by retail investors,” she said. “Now there is wider adoption of bitcoin and more institutions investing in it.”","Bitcoin pares losses on Friday, following a 13% drop during the week.

Cryptocurrency-exposed stocks began climbing again on Friday after a brutal week for the digital asset.

Bitcoin (BTC) was rising 6.5% to $32,455 after dropping about 13% during the week. Earlier in the month Bitcoin hit a record $41,947.

MicroStrategy (MSTR) - Get Report was up 5.7% to $550, after closing down 5.5% on Thursday. Bit Digital BTBT rose 6.6% to $17.43, following the previous day's 2.15% slide, while Riot Blockchain (RIOT) - Get Report advanced 14% to $22.07 after tumbling 13% on Thursday.

The total market value of all cryptocurrencies lost more than $100 billion in 48 hours, CNBC reported on Thursday.

The drop followed remarks by Janet Yellen, President Joe Biden's nominee for treasury secretary, who suggested on Tuesday that lawmakers curtail the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin due concerns about its use for illegal activities.

Yellen said during a confirmation hearing that many cryptocurrencies ""are used -- at least in a transaction sense -- mainly for illicit financing.""

""And I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that money laundering doesn't occur through those channels,"" she said.

Yellen also said that cryptocurrencies and other digital assets have the potential ""to improve the efficiency of the financial system.""

If confirmed, Yellen said she would work closely with the Federal Reserve and other federal regulators ""on how to implement an effective regulatory framework for these and other fintech innovations.""

In addition, bitcoin took a hit from a trade blog that suggested the existence of a double-spend, referring to the same bitcoin token being used by the same person in two different transactions.

J.P. Morgan analysts said on Thursday that bitcoin was the “least reliable hedge during periods of acute market stress.”

On Wednesday, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer upgraded PayPal (PYPL) - Get Report to buy from neutral with a $300 price target.

Palmer said that the company's long-term growth trajectory has steepened with the announcement that its 33 million active users would be able to buy, hold and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using their PayPal digital wallets.",Stop the Fixation With Bitcoin and Invest in Ethereum,"Cryptocurrencies could come under renewed regulatory scrutiny over the next four years if Janet Yellen, Joe Biden's pick to lead the Treasury Department, gets her way. During Yellen's confirmation hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Maggie Hassan (D-New Hampshire) asked Yellen about the use of cryptocurrency by terrorists and other criminals.

""Cryptocurrencies are a particular concern,"" Yellen responded. ""I think many are used—at least in a transactions sense—mainly for illicit financing.""

She said she wanted to ""examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that [money laundering] doesn't occur through those channels.""

Blockchain-based financial networks are attractive to criminals because they do not require users to identify themselves—as the law requires most conventional financial networks to do. Because no individual or organization controls these networks, there's no easy way for governments to force them to comply with money-laundering laws.

So instead of trying to force the networks themselves to comply, regulators in the US—and many other jurisdictions—have focused on regulating bitcoin exchanges that help users trade between dollars and cryptocurrencies. Once a bitcoin exchange identifies who initially received a particular bitcoin payment, law enforcement can often trace subsequent payments through a blockchain network's open payment ledger.

In December, Trump's outgoing team at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network—a unit of the Treasury Department focused on money laundering—proposed a new set of rules to tighten the screws on cryptocurrency-based money laundering.

Under the new rules, cryptocurrency-based exchanges would need to file transaction reports with FinCEN any time a customer made a cryptocurrency transaction worth more than $10,000. This would mirror existing rules requiring conventional banks to report when customers make cash withdrawals or deposits worth more than $10,000.

Even more controversial in the cryptocurrency world, FinCEN wants to impose new record-keeping requirements for transactions involving users who manage their own private keys—dubbed ""unhosted wallets"" by FinCEN. Under FinCEN's proposal, if a cryptocurrency exchange's customer sends more than $3,000 to an unhosted wallet, the exchange would be required to keep a record of the transaction, including the identity of the customer who initiated the payment.

These new rules didn't take effect before Trump left office, so the incoming Biden team will need to decide what to do with them. The Biden administration could sign off on the existing rules, rewrite them, or scrap them altogether. Yellen's comments on Tuesday suggest that she is unlikely to scrap the rules. If anything, the Treasury Department is likely to consider additional regulations of the blockchain economy over the next four years.

Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, Brock Pierce, and Monica Long of Ripple and Sasha Ivanov of Waves comment on the course of BTC.

It was a week of rough sailing for Bitcoin (BTC) this week. On January 21st, after a day of intensifying sell pressure, Bitcoin lost 13% of its value and dropped below $29,000 for the first time since January 5th, at a low of $28,750. It was the largest daily loss for BTC in over 10 months and analysts suggest that the price could retest at $24,0000.

The loss of 13% of Bitcoin's value has not taken the wind out of sails of dedicated Bitcoin devotees. Many analysts are calling this a predictable dip. Some have suggested that the institutional investors decided that the space was getting crowded and unloaded. Either way, the enthusiasm for BTC's decentralized currency remains untarnished — just a minor course correction on BTC's journey to greater value in 2021.

The macroeconomic conditions we saw last year, partly compounded by the pandemic, will continue to pressure more institutional investors to pursue ways to hedge against inflation.

Whether it is for trading or treasury management, institutional investors will consider BTC inevitably, so we think a steady upward trend for the rest of the year would be justified.

…In May last year, BTC had very little movement and subsequently the market started showing interest in altcoins the following month. By July, Ethereum saw 45% month-on-month growth, leading other altcoins and possibly helped propel BTC as well. So we already had an altcoin season last year, and there are prior similar cycles in hindsight but they are perhaps less dramatic in terms of the volume and value we have now…

Around this time last year, BTC was priced at ~$8,800. About five years ago BTC was valued at ~$400. So if we put ourselves in the shoes of someone who had HODL early, and how early is of course a matter of relativity, their excitement is understandable.

Many in the industry also recognize the entry of institutional players as a validation of BTC. Institutional investors can broadly be categorized as active traders, who have no directional bias, or treasuries who intend to allocate a portion of their funds for hedging against inflation…

We are creating worldwide access to digital currency and making that experience enjoyable for as many people as possible without compromising on security. There's no precedent in what we do…

The journey is just still getting started and one thing that we would highlight is DeFi. The industry is working together to explore ways to decentralize finance and that requires a new way of looking at how we save, spend, and access money.

BTC in itself is not as DeFi-enabled as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, because BTC wasn't originally built for those applications. Nonetheless, the BTC rally brings a positive effect into the whole market, and as we have seen, advancements in DeFi also spillovers into BTC.""

Brock Pierce, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation

""I think a lot of where Bitcoin heads depends on a number of other factors in the world. The economic situation, the political unrest, with the way that everything is lining up, I expect Bitcoin to go much higher — really as we have already started to see.

After breaking all-time highs of 20,000, how quickly we moved up to 40,000. There really are not many levels where I (anticipate) Bitcoin seeing resistance. We could get anywhere from 70,000 to 100,000 by the end of the year, but it will not be without volatility.

""In terms of ‘altcoin season,' for people who are looking at a lot of the altcoins that really didn't have a purpose, a lot of those have continued to be ""left for dead."" Whereas, we have seen a lot of strength in some of the stronger ecosystems, with Ethereum leading the way, and Polkadot, Cardano… the whole DeFi wave, with Yearn.Finance, and Aave and a handful of other projects there.

I don't think Bitcoin HODLers are getting carried away. A lot of the reasons and merits for Bitcoin that people have been talking about for the last 11 years now, we have seen start playing out in the last year or two.

It's one of those things: we can not control when people come around to it, or when exactly you need Bitcoin to protect you from inflation and a number of other things… but we have pretty high confidence that it is not about if' — just when.""

Monica Long, GM of RippleX at Ripple

""The economic fallout of the 2020 pandemic caused many governments globally to print fiat to stimulate the economy. Consumers and institutional investors alike looked to crypto as a safe haven from fiat debasement. This is a big reason why I believe institutional adoption of bitcoin has grown, as market participants look to this asset class as an inflation hedge.

This doesn't mean, however, that the global economy needs 2000+ digital assets. Every asset needs a use case like payments or store of value — a key point that those within crypto and those entering this space realize. What's also important is that I don't think there will be one asset to rule them all either — there's a very small chance that everyone in the world adopts the same single asset. Interoperability between networks is imperative — the more that developers look to build bridges and adopt open standards, the stronger all of crypto will become.

2020 did bring regulatory conversations to the forefront as we haven't seen in the past — many policymakers and regulators see the value in this technology — we've seen positive statements about CBDCs and stablecoins to increase financial access, but misinformation still remains. Some G20 markets like the UK, Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland have released thoughtful frameworks on how they view this technology, while others are still grappling with how to classify digital assets. For crypto to succeed, industry participants need to work with regulators, not against them. The technology is complementary with fiat, and can improve our global financial systems for all.""

Max Petrovskiy, Head of Growth and Strategy for Waves.

""I think BTC will be very volatile in 2021. Its rate could reach a short-term high, followed by several months of correction and then a drastic reaction to the overall situation in the world.

The ""altcoin season"" has begun, especially as far as the DeFi space and Ethereum are concerned. However, the situation is slightly different from that of 2017 when any garage-based startup or even a factory issued their tokens, attracting cash to the crypto industry. Today, there's much less hype and most projects have a very specific focus and don't target mass users.

The hype is vital for the crypto space as it brings liquidity and new users, which, due to the network effect, adds value to crypto, increasing its role as a store of value and payment instrument. In the longer run, the crypto space could turn into a new stock market that enables users to make money and learn new instruments.

Many users pay attention only to the speculative aspect of crypto. But they need to look at the crypto space as a tech platform for finance in general — from retail to institutional investors. We'll see more projects that are based on public blockchains but offer financial services on par with what today's best banks, brokers and insurance companies offer.""

Conclusion

The world at large seems far more prepared to accept Bitcoin after a generally disastrous 2020. The crypto world has adjusted and eliminated weaker projects, and its leadership is embracing the wider audience, even as their key buyers shift from the varied, anonymous, and unknowable whales to the familiar dark suits and ties of traditional finance.

Once a far-off shore, the reality of crypto mainstreaming seems to be upon us.

It seems that in its current iteration, Bitcoin has veered a bit from its intended purpose as decentralized, secure, and anonymous global digital currency and is landing as a ""safehaven"" store of value and a deflationary measure against a battered USD and a global unease about economic futures.

However, the process of currency adoption was never expected to be a small matter — time will provide the answers, not only to how much is Bitcoin worth, but how the mainstream audience will choose to use it.

My thanks to all who participated in this and the last installment and thanks to the many respondents whose answers could not be included due to space limitations.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is deepening its crypto footprint.

“Prospectus documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday indicate that BlackRock Global Allocation Fund Inc. and BlackRock Funds V are at least eyeing bitcoin. They both include “bitcoin” on their list of derivative products cleared for use,” reports Danny Nelson for CoinDesk.

Bitcoin futures debuted in the U.S. in late 2017.

Derivatives help increase liquidity and improve markets for an asset category by allowing investors to bet on ups and downs of an asset, even allowing individuals to adopt market-neutral strategies. They are also a key component in the creation of many futures-backed ETFs utilized by a range of investors.

Will Bitcoin Futures Jumpstart a Bitcoin ETF?

Some market observers believe the launch of Bitcoin futures will speed the introduction of exchange traded funds based on the digital currency. In recent weeks, several ETF issuers have also filed plans for blockchain ETFs, which would hold stocks with exposure to the digital currency trade.

“BlackRock did not state which commodity exchange it will choose to execute bitcoin futures buys. However, the funds may only invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures. CME is the only exchange registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that offers cash-settled bitcoin futures at this time,” according to CoinDesk.

Among the long list of issues facing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is adoption. When will crypto become more widely accepted for mainstream activities?

The good news is the adoption trajectory for Bitcoin looks compelling. Looking at the S-curve, which measures adoption of new technologies, Bitcoin is right where it should be according to many market observers.

“The filings appear to mark BlackRock’s entrance into the bitcoin market,” adds CoinDesk. “Before Wednesday, the investments giant has never so much as mentioned “bitcoin” in any of its regulatory filings. But that appears to be changing: “Certain Funds may engage in futures contracts based on bitcoin,” the prospectus documents state.”

FILE PHOTO: Representations of virtual currency bitcoin are seen in this picture illustration taken taken March 13, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

The scramble is pricing out smaller miners and accelerating an industry consolidation that could see deep-pocketed players, many outside China, profit from the bitcoin bull run.

Bitcoin mining is closely watched by traders and users of the world’s largest cryptocurrency, as the amount of bitcoin they make and sell into the market affects its supply and price.

Trading around $32,000 on Friday, bitcoin is down 20% from the record highs it struck two weeks ago but still up some 700% from its March low of $3,850.

“There are not enough chips to support the production of mining rigs,” said Alex Ao, vice president of Innosilicon, a chip designer and major provider of mining equipment.

Bitcoin miners use increasingly powerful, specially-designed computer equipment, or rigs, to verify bitcoin transactions in a process which produces newly minted bitcoins.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Samsung Electronics Co, the main producers of specially designed chips used in mining rigs, would also prioritise supplies to sectors such as consumer electronics, whose chip demand is seen as more stable, Ao said.

The global chip shortage is disrupting production across a global array of products, including automobiles, laptops and mobile phones.

Mining’s profitability depends on bitcoin’s price, the cost of the electricity used to power the rig, the rig’s efficiency, and how much computing power is needed to mine a bitcoin.

Demand for rigs has boomed as bitcoin prices soared, said Gordon Chen, co-founder of cryptocurrency asset manager and miner GMR.

“When gold prices jump, you need more shovels. When milk prices rise, you want more cows.”

CONSOLIDATION

Lei Tong, managing director of financial services at Babel Finance, which lends to miners, said that “almost all major miners are scouring the market for rigs, and they are willing to pay high prices for second-hand machines.”

“Purchase volumes from North America have been huge, squeezing supply in China,” he said, adding that many miners are placing orders for products that can only be delivered in August and September.

Most of the products of Bitmain, one of the biggest rig makers in China, are sold out, according the company’s website.

A sales manager at Jiangsu Haifanxin Technology, a rig merchant, said prices on the second-hand market have jumped 50% to 60% over the past year, while prices of new equipment more than doubled. High-end, second-hand mining machines were quoted around $5,000.

“It’s natural if you look at how much bitcoin has risen,” said the manager, who identified himself on by his surname Li.

The cryptocurrency surge is affecting who is able to mine.

The increasing cost of investment is eliminating smaller players, said Raymond Yuan, founder of Atlas Mining, which owns one of China’s biggest mining business.

“Institutional investors benefit from both large scale and proficiency in management whereas retail investors who couldn’t keep up will be weeded out,” said Yuan, whose company has invested over $500 million in cryptocurrency mining and plans to keep investing heavily.

Many of the larger players growing their mining operations are based outside of China, often in North America and the Middle East, said Wayne Zhao, chief operating officer of crypto research company TokenInsight.

“China used to have low electricity costs as one core advantage, but as the bitcoin price rises now, that has gone,” he said.

Zhao said that while previously bitcoin mining in China used to account for as much as 80% of the world’s total, it now accounted for around 50%.","Cryptocurrency miners in Iran say they are being scapegoated for power outages and pollution.

Tehran, Iran – An Iranian newspaper this week shamed government authorities for allowing cryptocurrency farms – especially those belonging to the Chinese – to mine bitcoin in Iran.

“Burning away public trust is even more dangerous than burning the people’s money in Chinese cryptocurrency farms,” read the Jomhouri-e Eslami editorial titled “Red farms!”

The accusations are not confined to one newspaper. For two weeks, Iranian social media, state-affiliated media, and dozens of local and national officials have weighed in on the subject of crypto farms, their electricity consumption and the alleged role mining plays in harming the nation’s air quality.

But members of the crypto community are crying foul, arguing that they are being scapegoated for Iran’s mounting woes as it battles the worst COVID-19 crisis in the Middle East and the crushing financial blow of the pandemic and United States economic sanctions.

Power outages and pollution

Crypto miners run powerful “farms” of computer gear that compete within a global, decentralised computer network to verify transactions made with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

In exchange for verifying “blocks” of transactions, miners are rewarded with new coins.

The profits can be handsome. Famously volatile, bitcoin surged to an all-time high value just shy of $42,000 on January 8 but has since fallen back to around $31,000.

But crypto mining requires a lot of electricity, which is subsidised in Iran, fuelling accusations that crypto miners are profiting at the expense of the state.

The latest backlash against crypto mining comes as Iran’s sprawling capital, Tehran, has been enveloped for the better part of a month in heavy smog [File: Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via Reuters] Crypto advocates counter that those subsidies are not as generous for miners, who are forced to shell out export rates for electricity and can end up paying 10 times what other industries pay for power during peak months.

The government and the public have also blamed crypto miners for nationwide power outages since 2019.

This latest backlash comes as Iran’s sprawling capital Tehran – home to more than eight million people, swelling to over 12 million when you add in commuters – has been enveloped for the better part of a month in heavy smog that has spread to other cities across the country.

The deterioration in air quality has been attributed to power plants that burn mazut, a heavy, low-quality fuel oil that releases high levels of sulfur dioxide.

“We don’t want mazut to be consumed at all, but we have no other option,” Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh admitted in early January, saying Iran’s mazut exports have been affected by US sanctions on the country’s oil industry.

Breathing toxic emissions directly contributes to 3,000 deaths in Tehran and 33,000 across Iran every year, according to the health ministry’s latest estimates in 2018.

Over a period of five days in December, close to 14,000 people across Iran were admitted to emergency rooms due to pollution-related complications, according to Mojtaba Khaledi, a spokesman for the Emergency Services Organization of Iran.

Iran’s electricity grid is experiencing a strain, which experts throughout the years have attributed to a range of fundamental issues, from mismanagement of power plants and old infrastructure that leads to energy waste to exceptionally high consumption levels of natural gas by households.

Earlier this week, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran – which has the second-largest natural gas reserves in the world – consumes more natural gas than 14 European countries in colder climates combined.

Now Tehran households are experiencing sporadic natural gas outages, too.

Crypto mining is currently the most cash-ready industry in Iran. Hamed Salehi, cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies researcher

Cash-ready industry

Iran has the capacity to produce up to 83,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity at the moment, officials say.

But though a number of officials have blamed cryptocurrency mining for straining the electricity grid, others have contradicted that claim.

Iran’s Minister of Energy Reza Ardakanian said on Tuesday that the country’s electricity usage peaks at 38,000MW per day while total consumption for cryptocurrency mining stands at just above 300MW

“A simple mathematical calculation will tell you what fraction of that huge number this is,” he told reporters, warning to be wary of factions that wish to use this opportunity to sow unrest.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies researcher Hamed Salehi said a lack of transparency by the energy ministry on large crypto mining farms – including how much energy each of them consumes and the type of equipment they use – fuels misinformation and creates a less-than-welcoming climate for an industry that is not under the yoke of US sanctions.

“What would be wrong with foreigners coming into Iran, obtaining all the official permits, and investing money to even build power substations for their [cryptocurrency mining] farms?” he asked Al Jazeera, adding “It would be a win for them, for the government and the people.”

“Crypto mining is currently the most cash-ready industry in Iran under sanctions and this is while miners are paying for their electricity at export rates,” Salehi said.

Though the Jomhouri-e Eslami editorial lashed out against “red farms”, there is only one crypto mining farm co-owned by China in the country, Mostfa Rajabi Mashhadi, spokesman for Iran’s power industry, told state television last week.

The farm in question is run by Iran & China Investment Development Group. On January 14, Iranian officials announced that it – along with a number of other Iranian crypto farms – would have power cut for two weeks without prior notice.

Mohammad Hassan Ranjbar, the CEO of Iran & China Investment Development Group, issued a statement condemning the move and the media hype around cryptocurrency mining.

“China is currently the only country that can invest in Iran due to sanctions. It is both wealthy and rich in technology, so we can create the grounds for more investments by helping each other,” he wrote, warning that China could take its business to another country, given mining bitcoin “is profitable anywhere in the world” at its recent valuation.

“They don’t even need to build power substations, are supported by governments and people, and are not sanctioned,” Ranjbar added.

Crackdown on illegal mining

It’s not just crypto farms operating above board that are in the crosshairs.

President Rouhani’s chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi, who formerly served a four-year term as information and communications technology minister, announced earlier this week that the intelligence ministry will begin investigating illegal cryptocurrency mining operations.

“It would also be false to say the government is using bitcorn,” he said, mispronouncing the name of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.

Mohammad Hassan Motevalizadeh, CEO of the state-run power company Tavanir, said this week that 45,000 illegal mining devices using 100MW per day have been confiscated recently.

It is estimated that illegal devices that weren’t caught up in the dragnet consume up to 300MW per day, or less than one percent of Iran’s peak power consumption.

It would be vain to say cryptocurrency mining is causing power outages in Iran with all the evidence to the contrary, said a 30-year-old who operates a legal farm with almost 1,000 devices and who asked to remain anonymous due to sensitivities involved.

“The solution to address power outages would be for officials and the energy ministry to develop infrastructures and methods of delivering electricity during peak hours,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that expanding solar and wind-powered stations would be one promising avenue.

“I agree that illegal farms should be dealt with,” researcher Salehi said.

“This is signalling foreigners not to come to Iran because something like this could happen to them at every moment. And it’s wrongly telling the people that crypto mining is for profiteers who waste away public resources.”","Joe Biden Freezes FinCEN's Crypto Wallet Rulemaking — US Crypto Regulations Under Review

New U.S. President Joe Biden has frozen all agency rulemaking, including the proposal by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) relating to cryptocurrency wallets. Biden will appoint someone to “review any new or pending rules,” the White House has announced.

FinCEN’s Crypto Wallet Proposal Frozen, Pending Regulatory Review

Joe Biden, the 46th president of the United States, has frozen all rulemaking carried over from the previous administration, the White House announced after his inauguration Wednesday. This would include the proposal by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) affecting cryptocurrency wallets. The freeze is “In order to ensure that the president’s appointees or designees have the opportunity to review any new or pending rules.”

The announcement elaborates:

With respect to rules that … have not taken effect, consider postponing the rules’ effective dates for 60 days from the date of this memorandum.

“For rules postponed in this manner, during the 60-day period … consider opening a 30-day comment period to allow interested parties to provide comments about issues,” it adds, noting that the delay could be extended if necessary.

The crypto community welcomes this regulatory freeze news. Lawyer Jake Chervinsky, who played a critical role in spearheading the crypto community to submit comments to FinCEN, tweeted:

President Biden has frozen all agency rulemaking pending further review. This includes former Secretary Mnuchin’s proposal on ‘unhosted wallets.’

The lawyer added: “We fought hard & earned the right to take a breath & reset. Janet Yellen isn’t Steve Mnuchin. I’m optimistic.” Biden has picked Yellen to become the new Treasury Secretary. The former Federal Reserve chair is not a fan of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies herself, stating during a recent Senate hearing that cryptocurrencies are mostly used for illicit financing.

Besides FinCEN’s rulemaking on cryptocurrency wallets, Biden has inherited a few other crypto regulatory issues from the Trump administration relating to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Former OCC chief Brian Brooks had warned that some of the positive crypto regulations he approved may be rolled back during the Biden administration. They include allowing banks to provide crypto custody services and use public blockchains and stablecoins.

“Blockchain, cryptocurrency, and decentralized finance are doing to banks what email did to the post office. Our job is to rethink the role of banks,” Brooks highlighted in an article he authored on The Hill last week. “Because of their investment in technology, banks will be key nodes that validate transactions on decentralized ledgers, and will transmit and receive tokens across blockchains like they process digital payments today,” he opined. “Banks will also provide advice, custody, and structured products. Banks could also reprise their 19th century role of issuing Treasury notes and issue digital coins backed by dollars.” He additionally noted:

Cryptocurrency and decentralized finance present several benefits … If the United States focuses on the risks and not the benefits, we will fall behind as the global financial system is rewired.

Among the benefits, Brooks listed “increasing financial access, giving people greater control over their financial lives, and accelerating global payments.”

The former top banking regulator is particularly concerned about a proposal by Congresswoman Maxine Waters. He urged the Biden administration not to “combine politics and innovation.” Brooks explained that “House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters proposes reversing innovation that occurred in the last four years,” adding that “She wants to retract the ability for banks to hold cryptocurrency assets and to rescind guidance that banks can support digital coins.”

There are also some outstanding crypto-related issues at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the lawsuit against Ripple Labs and its executives. Biden has nominated MIT’s blockchain professor Gary Gensler to become the new SEC chairman.

2021-01-23,"Janet Yellen Clarifies Her Stance on Bitcoin — Promises 'Effective' Crypto Regulation

Joe Biden’s pick to become the new U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, has clarified her stance on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This follows her remarks during a Senate hearing when she said that cryptocurrencies are mostly used for illicit financing.

Janet Yellen Clarifies Her Crypto Plans

Janet Yellen clarified her position on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in a written testimony published Thursday following the Senate hearing on her nomination as the Treasury Secretary. During the hearing, Yellen made some statements regarding cryptocurrencies which were heavily criticized as being inaccurate.

The finance committee began by briefly describing the benefits and risks of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin and other digital and cryptocurrencies are providing financial transactions around the globe, like many technological developments, this offers potential benefits for the U.S., and our allies,” the written testimony reads. “At the same time, it also presents opportunities for states and non-state actors looking to circumvent the current financial system and undermine American interests. For example, the Central Bank of China just issued its first digital currency.”

“Dr. Yellen, what do you view as the potential threats and benefits these innovations and technologies will have on U.S. national security? Do you think more needs to be done to ensure we have appropriate safeguards and regulations for digital and cryptocurrencies in place?” the finance committee asked the Treasury Secretary nominee.

Yellen replied: “I think it important we consider the benefits of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, and the potential they have to improve the efficiency of the financial system.”

She continued, “At the same time, we know they can be used to finance terrorism, facilitate money laundering, and support malign activities that threaten U.S. national security interests and the integrity of the U.S. and international financial systems,” elaborating:

I think we need to look closely at how to encourage their use for legitimate activities while curtailing their use for malign and illegal activities.

“If confirmed, I intend to work closely with the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking and securities regulators on how to implement an effective regulatory framework for these and other fintech innovations,” Yellen concluded.

Yellen’s clarification marginally softens her stance on cryptocurrency, contrasting her previous statements made during her confirmation Senate hearing. “Cryptocurrencies are a particular concern. I think many are used … mainly for illicit financing and I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that anti-money laundering (sic) doesn’t occur through those channels,” Yellen said a few days prior.

Last week, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christian Lagarde, also made a statement about bitcoin that drew much criticism. She said bitcoin “has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity.” Many were also quick to point out how wrong Lagarde was, including a famed economist who said her statement was “outrageous.” He stressed that “we all know that the vast majority of money laundering globally is conducted in fiat currencies, particularly in U.S. dollars and euros.”

Bitcoin hit a new high in early January, reaching a price of nearly $42,000. On Friday morning, the price of the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency was about 32,500, according to CoinDesk. Even mainstream financial institutions are warming up: JP Morgan said, in the long-term, if the market cap gets high enough that it competes with gold, the price of bitcoin could reach $146,000, in a note published in January. (Bitcoin currently has a market value of over $600 billion.) But more than just a cryptocurrency, bitcoin has become an obsession for many. Here are some of the behavioral and psychological reasons why.

Bitcoin becomes part of your identity

Bitcoin is ""more religion than solution to any problem,"" billionaire Mark Cuban told Forbes in December. In fact, bitcoin aficionados have their own jargon full of acronyms and phrases from ""HODL"" to ""whale,"" and (pre-Covid) bitcoin conferences would attract thousands of attendees. The crypto crow even has a preferred car to buy with their bitcoin: the Lambo (aka Lamborghini). ""The culture around bitcoin is part of the appeal,"" says Finn Breton, professor of science and technology at the University of California Davis and author of ""Digital Cash: The Unknown History of the Anarchists, Utopians, and Technologists Who Created Cryptocurrency.""

""When you buy bitcoin, you're actually buying into a whole scene,"" Breton says. ""And it's a scene that can be a part of your identity."" Though bitcoin is getting more attention from some serious investors and mainstream financial institutions, it's still a somewhat subversive concept, so people who invest in it can view themselves as radical or participating in counterculture, Breton says.

Social media plays into it

From celebrities who invest in bitcoin, to a highly-engaged bitcoin community on Twitter, TikTok and Reddit, social media feeds into bitcoin's popularity. ""Suddenly, there's like a new way to see, finance and to have an identity of yourself as an actor in like the financial space,"" says Lana Swartz, assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and author of ""New Money: How Payment Became Social Media,"" tells CNBC Make It. These social platforms can also drive behaviors, according to Utpal Dholakia professor of marketing at Rice University, who studies consumer financial decision-making. Research has shown that when people talk about their investments in online social environments, they tend to become more risk-seeking in the types of investments they make, he tells CNBC Make It. ""The same dynamic applies to a lot of investment decisions which are being made right now,"" Dholakia says.

The volatility can be exciting

Many smart investors, from Kevin O'Leary to CNBC's Jim Cramer, have likened buying bitcoin to going to Vegas. Berkshire Hathaway CEO and chairman Warren Buffett has been a longtime critic of bitcoin, saying that ""cryptocurrencies basically have no value"" and are a ""gambling device."" And as with gambling, ""some people certainly enjoy that thrill,"" Dholakia says. Checking the price of stocks regularly is an activity that could get boring, says Tom Meyvis, professor of marketing at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. ""With something like bitcoin, it's exciting because there's constantly something happening,"" he says. ""You can check it 10 times a day and the price can vary wildly."" Also, many young people especially, who have grown up with video games and social media, are conditioned to want instant gratification and fast-paced cycles, Swartz says. Being drawn to high-risk high-reward investments like bitcoin ""makes perfect sense,"" she says.

FOMO

People get excited by the prospect of bringing a new, potentially life-changing, technology into the world. And with bitcoin bulls predicting the crypto's price could go as high $200,000 over the next decade, and with mainstream financial businesses from Paypal to Square getting into bitcoin, it's hard not to fear missing out. Add to that the viral stories about people who have had success with bitcoin: There are enviable windfalls, from instant bitcoin millionaires to stories like the ""Bitcoin Family,"" a Dutch family of five who liquidated their assets in 2017 in exchange for bitcoin (when bitcoin was priced at $900), moved into a van and traveled the world. ""People focus more on the upside than the downside,"" says Meyvis. So it's easy to get swept up in the possibilities that could come from bitcoin.

An early bitcoin adopter says the best time to buy is when no one's talking about it.

He started out with an initial purchase of 2.5 bitcoins in 2013, when the token was trading around $100.

The buyer, who prefers to remain anonymous, lost 16 bitcoins in the 2014 Mt. Gox scandal.

Sign up here our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

The ultimate time to buy bitcoin is when no one is talking about it, according to one early adopter.

""The best time to buy bitcoin is whenever blood is on the street, everyone's panicking, and no one's talking about it,"" the investor, who prefers to remain anonymous, told Insider in a phone interview from Manila, Philippines.

In 2013, he made an initial purchase of 2.5 bitcoins from a seller who went by the name ""Mang Sweeney"" on LocalBitcoins.com when the cryptocurrency was trading at $100 per coin. ""Mang"" denotes a sign of respect in the local language in the Philippines.

At the time, the platform allowed face-to-face meetings, after which the seller would transfer the cryptocurrency on-the-spot via their laptop or mobile. Mang Sweeney was already trading bitcoin when it was worth $10 a coin since speculative buying and selling was popular even then, according to the anonymous buyer.

Still, online interest in bitcoin in 2013-14 was nowhere near current levels. A chart below shows how Google searches for ""bitcoin"" in the Philippines have risen steadily since that period, then hit a peak in late 2017 when its price shot to a record high. It declined throughout 2018, but has returned in the last year.

""People forget this isn't the first bubble,"" the investor said. ""Until people understand the technology of it, it will always be a speculative asset.""

The early bitcoin buyer said he doesn't advise friends and family to trade the token when it's stuck in bubble territory. ""When no one wants to touch it, that's when you buy it. Not when people are talking about it,"" he said.

Bitcoin's deflationary nature discourages using it as a real currency, according to him. He lost 16 bitcoins in the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, one of the few exchanges that early adopters could trade on. It closed abruptly in 2014 following its collapse after hackers apparently raided the exchange. Almost 850,000 bitcoins belonging to investors were lost.

Anyone talking up the $100,000-$150,000 level, according to him, are actually unloading their bitcoin investments bit by bit while saying it'll get to a certain price because some of them have already accumulated large amounts.

""The only reason I would tell people to dabble in it is because it's important to understand how it works and how to take care of it. If you don't know your way around passwords or simple two-factor authentication then you're going to get creamed. People will steal your bitcoin,"" he warned.

But there are voices cautioning investors who are beginning to view bitcoin as digital gold.

""For bitcoin to be considered in a portfolio and to become an investable asset, similar to gold, the asset would need to improve the risk-return profile of that portfolio,"" said Gerald Moser, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank. ""This seems a tall order.""

While it is near impossible to forecast an expected return for bitcoin, its volatility makes the asset almost ""uninvestable"" from a portfolio perspective, he said.

Read more: GOLDMAN SACHS: These 22 stocks still haven't recovered to pre-pandemic levels - and are set to explode amid higher earnings in 2021 as the economy recovers","2020 was a seeming conundrum in financial markets. In the midst of the pandemic, many investors turned a tidy profit. In particular, owners of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had a banner year. Bitcoin increased over 300% in value. Congrats if you called it and got in ahead of the boom. And as cryptocurrencies are a scarce resource, there could be more long-term upside in crypto prices.

But I'm not here to make that call. Instead, I'm talking about stocks that will benefit from the long-term increase in usage of digital assets. And CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) could be the best business for investing in the trend.

More than just a supply and demand discussion

Cryptocurrency prices are not the best measure of how useful a digital currency actually is. Rather, they're a short-term measure of supply and demand. This is the case with any asset price in the short term, stocks included. Think back to your Econ 101 class: All resources are finite in supply, so changes in demand dictate the price of said resource. If demand exceeds supply, then prices go up; if demand dips below available supply, prices go down. Cryptocurrencies -- embodied by bitcoin -- were in very high demand in 2020 relative to the limited supply of digital coins in actual circulation. (Of note, most bitcoins in existence are not actually in circulation, as explained by fellow Fool.com contributor Sean Williams.) In 2018, it was the opposite situation.

But these wild fluctuations in price don't exactly measure digital money's (and the underlying blockchain technology's) usefulness -- that is to say, how many (or how few in this case) consumers and businesses are using bitcoin in their daily activities. For many investors, myself included at the moment, a lack of utility makes cryptocurrencies a hard pass after their epic run in the last year.

But is there a way to bet on the long-term growth in acceptance of digital currency (the true measure of any currency's worth as a storage of value) without needing to worry about wild swings in cryptocurrency prices themselves? Yes, and I think the ticket is CME Group.

Traded, accepted, or otherwise gone mainstream

CME Group is the world's largest marketplace of derivatives contracts -- options and futures (a pre-agreed-upon price for delivery of an asset at a future date) for a long list of things from company stock to commodities like oil and agricultural products to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. While derivatives have a bad rap in some investors' minds (thanks to the wild speculation they can help enable), contracts like options and futures have been in use for centuries as a way for people and organizations to manage risk and from which to discover information about expectations within the economy.

By and large, it's for this risk mitigation that options and futures contracts are used. And CME is an efficient and very profitable facilitator of risk transference. The marketplace generated free cash flow (revenue minus cash operating expenses and capital expenditures) of $1.77 billion on revenue of $3.73 billion through the first nine months of 2020 -- an incredible margin of 47%. The company has a nearly two-decade-long track record paying a steadily rising quarterly dividend (currently $0.85 per share each quarter in 2020, yielding 1.8% at Friday's prices) and often pays a special dividend at the end of the year to distribute excess cash. For 2020, the one-time special dividend was $2.50 per share, boosting the stock's effective annual yield to 3.1%.

But what's all this to cryptocurrency? CME launched futures contracts on bitcoin in 2017, expanded the market to include bitcoin futures options in early 2020, and will add a new cryptocurrency marketplace via Ether futures (a unit of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto behind bitcoin) in February 2021. Derivatives contracts on the two largest crypto assets are a big deal if you believe adoption of digital currency will increase over time. Derivatives can help make a market for an asset more stable and could encourage businesses and organizations to accept their use. And CME earns a small fee every time a contract is traded.

For example, let's say a retailer wants to begin accepting bitcoin or Ethereum as a form of payment from customers, but it needs to report financial results and pay its bills (including taxes) in U.S. dollars. Derivatives can help it hedge against loss from possible declines in crypto prices on the revenue it collects. CME is helping make such risk mitigation possible, and adding legitimacy for bitcoin and Ethereum as a form of payment along the way.

By expanding its steadily growing marketplace into digital assets, CME Group could benefit from continual adoption of cryptocurrencies in the economy -- not just yielding its growth from how many investors want to buy or trade the digital currencies themselves at any given point in time. Over the long term, this could be an important area of growth for CME if digital assets like bitcoin and Ethereum gain momentum as a form of payment and blockchain technology finds other areas of use.

It would be a mistake to draw a hard comparison between the current phenomenon occurring with bitcoin prices and bubbles in the past (like, say, the tech bubble of the late 1990s). However, a current lack of mainstream adoption of digital assets gives me pause before investing directly in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That isn't to say there isn't actual use of cryptocurrency in the economy -- and I think there's a very high chance adoption will continue to expand in the decades to come. But if you want to bet digital currency usefulness will increase over time, I think CME Group is a great place to start.","Bitcoin, BTC to USD, fell by 2.81% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 7.02% rally from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $32,099.0.

It was a mixed start to the day. Bitcoin fell to an early morning low $32,138.0 before making a move.

The early pullback saw Bitcoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $33,008.

Steering clear of the major support levels, however, Bitcoin rose to a mid-morning intraday high $33,554.0.

Bitcoin broke back through the 23.6% FIB before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $34,942, Bitcoin slid to an early afternoon intraday low $31,439.4.

Bitcoin fell back through the 23.6% FIB, while steering clear of the first major support level at $30,081.

Finding support late in the day, Bitcoin briefly revisited $32,500 levels before easing back.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the latest sell-off. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $18,504 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Saturday.

Chainlink and Polkadot jumped by 14.87% and by 12.53% respectively to lead the way.

Binance Coin (+0.09%), Ethereum (+0.09%), and Litecoin (+0.01%) also ended the day in the green.

It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors, however.

Bitcoin Cash SV slid by 4.55% to lead the way down.

Cardano’s ADA (-0.90%), Crypto.com Coin (-2.72%), and Ripple’s XRP (-0.12%) also joined Bitcoin in the red.

In the current week, the crypto total market cap rose to a Tuesday high $1,080.72bn before sliding to an early Saturday low $812.79bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $919.19bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Monday high 67.47% before falling to a Saturday low 64.14%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 64.33%.

This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.88% to $31,815.0. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning high $32,099.0 to a low $31,709.0.

Story continues

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day.

Bitcoin Cash SV and Crypto.com Coin bucked the trend early on, with gains of 1.59% and 0.84% respectively.

It was a bearish start for the rest of the majors, however.

At the time of writing, Chainlink was down by 0.97% to lead the way down.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to move through the pivot level at $32,364 to bring the 23.6% FIB of $33,008 and the first major resistance level at $33,289 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $33,000 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the 23.6% FIB and the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $35,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $34,479.

Failure to move through the $32,364 pivot would bring the first major support level at $31,174 into play.

Barring an extended crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$30,000 levels. The second major support level at $30,250 should limit the downside.

More From FXEMPIRE:","Crypto Crime Fell Sharply to Only 0.3% of All Cryptocurrency Activity in 2020

A study by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis finds that cryptocurrency-related crime has fallen significantly. The criminal share of all crypto activity fell to just 0.34% in 2020. This contradicts recent statements by U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen and ECB President Christine Lagarde that cryptocurrencies are mostly used for illicit financing.

Crypto Crime Plummeted in 2020

Chainalysis shared some findings from its 2021 Crypto Crime Report this week. While acknowledging that “cryptocurrency remains appealing for criminals as well due primarily to its pseudonymous nature and the ease with which it allows users to send funds anywhere in the world instantly,” the blockchain analytics firm detailed:

The good news is that cryptocurrency-related crime fell significantly in 2020 … In 2020, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just 0.34%, or $10.0 billion in transaction volume.

In comparison, the firm explained that in 2019, “criminal activity represented 2.1% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume, or roughly $21.4 billion worth of transfers.” Last year, “One reason the percentage of criminal activity fell is because overall economic activity nearly tripled between 2019 and 2020,” the company noted.

Chainalysis noted that darknet markets were the second-largest crime category. It accounted for $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency activity, which was an increase from $1.3 billion in the previous year. Ransomware accounted for just 7% of all funds received by criminal addresses, which was just under $350 million worth of cryptocurrency. While small, ransomware saw a 311% jump over 2019.

The findings by Chainalysis contradict the recent statements made by Joe Biden’s pick for the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, and ECB President Christine Lagarde. Yellen said Tuesday that many cryptocurrencies are used “mainly for illicit financing.” Meanwhile, Lagarde said last week that bitcoin “has conducted some funny business” and some “totally reprehensible money laundering activity.”

Several people in the crypto industry have pointed out the error of their statements, including a well-known economist who called Lagarde’s statement “outrageous.” He emphasized, “we all know that the vast majority of money laundering globally is conducted in fiat currencies, particularly in U.S. dollars and euros.”

Given that, it’s easy to feel like you missed the boat if you weren’t an early cryptocurrency adopter. But with a Coinmine One Bitcoin mining machine, cryptocurrency can once again be mined by almost anyone.

Coinmine

The Coinmine One is Coinmine’s flagship product, and was created to re-democratize cryptocurrency for everyone. Put simply, the Coinmine One is a specialized mining computer that takes the complicated process of cryptocurrency mining and automates it. It’s a Application-Specific Integrated Circuits device that only needs a working wifi connection and a Coinmine app to get started. Once it’s up and running, you’ll be mining your own cryptocurrencies automatically — a true, and potentially lucrative, “Set It and Forget It” scenario.

The Coinmine One costs less than a new iPhone and is designed to be extremely easy to set up. It’s quiet, energy efficient, comes in your choice of white or black, and can mine a multitude of different cryptocurrencies.

You could use the Coinmine One to mine popular cyptos like Bitcoin or Ethereum. But, as Coinmine co-founder Farbood Nivi recently told the Los Angeles Times, the real purpose of the Coinmine One is to allow users to discover the next Bitcoin or Ethereum, and make some money in the process:

You can use your Coinmine One to automatically mine such up-and-coming cryptocurrencies as Monero, Grin, and Zcash, and the Coinmine app will allow you to mine even newer cryptos as they’re developed.

Even with a Coinmine One, hitting major paydirt will take some luck and savvy. But even while you’re waiting for the iron to heat up, Coinmine One offers some real benefits for cryptocurrency investors. You can earn your own bitcoins with every transaction routed through the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which also lets you send and receive bitcoins nearly instantaneously and at very little cost. By storing any cryptos you mine in your Coinmine digital wallet, you can earn at least 6.5% APR in interest.

While the Coinmine One is designed to be usable by any amateur crypto miner, the Coinmine app also offers the ability to finely control your mining behavior depending on the trends of the day. Notice a new trend that looks good (and profitable) to you on a certain day? Simply switch up what you’re using the Coinmine One to mine, which you can do every day or even every hour if you want to.

If you’re still on the fence about breaking into crypto mining for yourself with the Coinmine One, you may be interested to know that it has some of the biggest names in cryptocurrency providing its funding. This includes Coinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. So head over to the Coinmine site now and learn more.

The crypto exchange has said users will now be banned from withdrawals unless they are able to verify their ownership of external wallets, following the introduction of new regulations designed to tackle money laundering and other financial crimes in the European country.

Bitstamp will now require KYC before withdrawals.

In a letter from Bitstamp posted to Twitter, the exchange said the additional KYC layer would be required before user wallets can be whitelisted for withdrawals. “Whitelisting is a security feature which was already available at Bitstamp, but now it has become obligatory for all customers affected by the new regulation in the Netherlands.” The measures have been adopted in response to regulations that came into force in November, which require “crypto service providers must check whether their clients and any ultimate beneficiary owners are on a Dutch or European sanctions list.” The regulations also require exchanges to monitor “incoming and outgoing payment transfers” to detect and flag irregularities.

Yes, this is real. People in the Netherlands now have to KYC their withdraw addresses. pic.twitter.com/S2H5Gszh9X — Bitcoin Marcus ☣️🐝⚡️ (@plan_marcus) January 17, 2021

Bitstamp becomes the latest exchange to adopt new KYC regulations.

In announcing the measures, Bitstamp becomes the latest exchange to adopt the new requirements in the Netherlands. Others have already taken steps to tighten up their KYC requirements, with local exchange Bitconic describing the measures to its customers as “a nuisance.” As other crypto exchanges come on board, the policy looks set to ensure that all crypto users in the Netherlands provide additional ID documentation before being allowed to withdraw to external wallets. The KYC announcement comes amid a wider global tightening of restrictions on digital currency exchanges and their users."
2021-01-24,"Cryptocurrency-related crime fell last year to a small fraction of overall trading volume. But some targeted hacks boomed as criminals exploited people working from home during the pandemic.

Last year, illicit activity made up 0.34% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume, according to a report from blockchain data firm Chainalysis. That was down from roughly 2% a year earlier.

""We saw a significant decrease in the share of overall activity associated with illicit entities,"" Kim Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis, told CNBC. ""Still, ransomware was by far the biggest category in terms of activity growth and we're seeing an all time high for dark-net market activity.""

Ransomware is malicious software hackers use to infect a computer, then demand a fee to unlock it. That bounty is often paid in bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies.

The category made up just 7% of all crypto funds received by criminals, but increased by 311% year over year. Chainalysis pointed to more people working from home as a new vulnerability for companies — and an opportunity for criminals.

Dark net markets were the second-largest crime category, accounting for $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency activity — a roughly 30% increase from a year earlier. Also known as the dark web, the dark net is a network that uses the internet, but requires specific software and authorizations to access.","Bradley Duke is chief executive of ETC Group, which runs the Bitcoin Exchange Traded Crypto product ETC Group

Bradley Duke's BTCetc product has soared since it launched in June 2020.

The bitcoin price rise has sent investors flocking towards ""access products,"" he says.

But regulators and critics are making louder warnings about ""volatile"" bitcoin.

It's been a dizzying few months for Bradley Duke. The chief executive of ETC Group has seen his company's bitcoin Exchange Traded Crypto product surge in value by around 200% in 6 months as interest in digital currencies has boomed.

Duke and ETC's fortunes have been propelled by the huge surge in the bitcoin price. It has risen more than 280% over the last year to $32,284 on Friday morning. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of close to $42,000 earlier this month before sliding last week.

Retail investors, and even now some institutions, have rushed towards products such as the Exchange Traded Crypto (known as the BTCetc or BTCE), which tracks the price of bitcoin and is listed on the German XETRA and Swiss Six exchanges.

Duke says the fund had around $475 million in assets under management two weeks ago (although the figure will have fallen last week along with bitcoin), having only launched in June last year. And the product's trading volumes rival those of Europe's biggest exchange-traded funds: In the first week of the year, volumes averaged around €50.4 million ($61.2 million) a day, according to Deutsche Boerse data, and hit a record daily high of €92.6 million on January 11.

""It is fantastic that we did manage to catch this wave,"" Duke tells Insider. ""It is a wave, in the end, and there's a lot to be said for timing.""

Read more: We spoke to Winklevoss-backed crypto platform Gemini about bitcoin and why regulation won't kill the boom in digital currencies

But Duke doesn't mean the wave is necessarily about to crash. ""There's definitely been a groundswell, to continue the wave metaphor,"" he says. He cites the huge COVID-19 stimulus packages unleashed by governments and central banks, and says they have sparked ""concerns about inflationary forces or devaluing forces"" on national currencies and helped drive up the bitcoin price.

Cryptocurrencies remain highly controversial, however, largely because of their wild volatility. If the price of bitcoin plunges as it has in the past, the value of investments in even regulated products like BTCE could fall to next to nothing. Such worries prompted the UK financial watchdog to warn this month that investors in bitcoin could ""lose all their money.""

Bitcoin ETPs put a 'regulatory wrapper' around crypto

Duke is reluctant to give advice on the path of the bitcoin price, saying: ""I don't know what's going to happen.""

Yet he argues that exchange-traded products like BTCE have been a major factor in making institutional investors feel more comfortable about cryptocurrencies, which has helped support prices.

BTCE lets investors gain exposure to bitcoin without having to buy the digital currency on unregulated exchanges, for a 2% fee. It tracks the price closely, is centrally cleared, and units can be redeemed for bitcoin or cash.

Overseen by German and Swiss watchdogs, BTCE puts ""a regulatory wrapper around an unregulated asset class,"" Duke says.

He says the company wanted to build an ""access product"" that ""ticked a lot of the boxes for the institutional investor."" Duke says: ""Definitely it started out by being mostly retail and that end of the spectrum, and then it's definitely changed in composition to the more institutional.""

Bitcoin price has had 'support at every level' in recent months

Cryptocurrency supporters argue that the interest of institutional investors is a key reason the bitcoin price is unlikely to suffer a dramatic plunge, as it did in 2018 when it fell from a high of more than $19,000 to around $3,000 in just over a year.

On Wednesday, BlackRock moved to add bitcoin derivatives to two of its funds. Billionaire investors such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller have also invested, suggesting it can be a diversifier in a portfolio at times of uncertainty akin to gold.

Duke says institutional investors are one reason bitcoin appears to have had ""support at every new price level over the last six months."" He adds: ""It just feels a little bit different to how it was before. You feel like there's a lot more people who are there, who are coming in, and who are holding and not interested in just taking short-term profits.""

Yet most institutional investors are still skeptical. A survey by Deutsche Bank last week showed investors rated bitcoin an 8.7 out of 10 on a ""bubble"" scale.

Gerald Moser, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said in a note that bitcoin ""seems to falter when diversification is most needed, such as during sharp downturns in financial markets."" He also said bitcoin's volatility ""makes the asset almost uninvestable.""

Some bitcoin regulators have 'missed a trick'

Duke insists that products like his are crucial to helping cryptocurrency mature as a market. But he isn't worried that new rules will reduce bitcoin's appeal, in part because regulation is ""a very difficult thing to do.""

He says regulators such as the UK's Financial Conduct Authority who have clamped down on retail consumers' access to bitcoin products ""missed a trick."" (The FCA says it is protecting customers for an ""extremely volatile"" asset.)

Duke argues regulators should ""take a pragmatic approach and say, how best can we encourage this growth in services, but in a sensible way where we are not allowing bad actors to proliferate.""

Yet for now, regulators look set to step up scrutiny of cryptocurrencies. Treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen last week suggested the use of bitcoin should be ""curtailed"" as transactions are ""mainly for illicit financing.""

When it comes to investor interest in products like BTCE, the bitcoin price is all-important. The next few weeks look set to be key, with a rise past $40,000 or a tumble to $25,000 or lower both possibilities. One thing is for certain, the arguments over cryptocurrencies will continue to rage.","Maybe it’s just that winter is dragging on, but I find myself getting increasingly irritated with mainstream reports about Bitcoin that say it was a result of the financial crisis.

It wasn’t, and that matters.

First, let’s look at why it wasn’t, and then I’ll explain why this misunderstanding bothers me.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto started working on the Bitcoin white paper in early 2007, over a year before the financial crisis hit mainstream markets.

In early 2007, the subprime mortgage industry was collapsing, but even lifelong finance insiders didn’t foresee the scale of what was to unfold. As Satoshi worked, bankruptcies and bank tremors would have been making the headlines, but there is no indication this added to his* urgency.

(*We don’t know that Satoshi was a “he,” but to avoid linguistic clutter I’ll use that pronoun throughout.)

By the time Satoshi uploaded the white paper to a cryptography mailing list in October 2008, the markets were in full meltdown, the U.S. government was taking over parts of the financial ecosystem, and central banks around the world were dropping interest rates and printing money.

The genesis block, mined by Satoshi in early January 2009, included the text of a headline from that day: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

Many have taken this as proof that Bitcoin was created in reaction to the crisis. This reveals a lack of understanding of how much work went into the design of Bitcoin, as well as the long history behind the idea of peer-to-peer finance.

History matters

The confusion is also potentially damaging to the Bitcoin narrative.

Why? Because it misrepresents the intentions of the army of cryptographers that had been working on a decentralized electronic cash solution for decades. It diminishes the bigger picture.

Satoshi was not reacting to an event, just as those on whose shoulders he stood weren’t planning for a specific circumstance. They were all trying to solve the fundamental issue of financial sovereignty.

While we do not have (that I’m aware of) evidence of Satoshi’s thoughts on the financial system from before the publication of the Bitcoin white paper, shortly after the genesis block was mined, Satoshi wrote:

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”

Satoshi was not referencing the financial mess at the time, even though its fallout was loud and hard to ignore. He showed signs of bigger thinking.

And as for the genesis block itself, maybe the timing and choice of embedded text was intentional, or maybe it was a coincidence – we’ll never know for sure. Either way, a point was made.

That point was a dig at how politically beholden the banking system had become. It highlighted the lack of solid financial structure and the diminishing trust in institutional solvency. It essentially represented the financial crisis that was unfolding. But it was an example rather than a smoking gun.

The financial crisis was not the reason for Bitcoin. It was a symptom of the reason for Bitcoin. And if we continue to hear claims that the crisis was the cause, we will start to believe that Bitcoin is a new solution to a relatively new problem.

It isn’t. It’s a long-awaited solution to a long-standing problem.

If we continue to think of Bitcoin solely in the context of financial crises, we could start to believe that the need for it will diminish as the painful adjustments recede into the mists of time.

It won’t – the technology can’t be put back into its bottle. Nor can the growing awareness of the vulnerabilities inherent in the financial system on which we all rely.

Bitcoin has managed to spread ideas that were previously the purview of an arcane mailing list, and in so doing has changed the way we look at our financial rights, our data, even our identity. True, the timing of Bitcoin’s emergence helped with that spread, and the recent departure from traditional monetary policy has accelerated it. Financial privacy, seizure resistance and fiat debasement are just some of the concepts that the crypto market price swings have pushed into conversations that now reach even the hallowed halls of traditional finance.

But Bitcoin was not created to fix crises. It was created to give people a choice.

Let’s stop treating it as a reaction to a specific situation, and recognize that Bitcoin is a technological evolution of a process that started decades ago.

Let’s also give credit to a group of thinkers who realized from way back where centralization of finance and our economy could eventually lead.

Regime change

After a momentous week in which COVID-19 briefly stepped back from the headlines to give space for us spectators to appreciate hope, rhetoric and a peaceful transfer of power, it feels good to take a breather and contemplate the scope of potential change ahead.

It’s not just that market infrastructure and institutional interest are growing in leaps and bounds (more on that below). It’s also that many of the regulatory authorities that determine the framework of financial markets, custody and value transfer are changing guard.

Gary Gensler is expected to be the next chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This possibility was reported last week, and was flagged as potentially very good news for the crypto industry because Gensler has not only researched and often spoken in public about crypto assets and blockchain technology – he also has taught a course on the subject at MIT.

Chris Brummer, a Georgetown University law professor who runs the annual D.C. Fintech Week conference, edited a book on crypto assets and hosts the excellent Fintech Beat podcast, which often features compelling crypto content, may be the next chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), according to Reuters.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Michael S. Barr, a former U.S. Treasury Department official and onetime member of Ripple’s board of advisers, is likely to become the next Comptroller of the Currency.

This almost seems like a crypto-savvy trifecta of financial regulators which, as my colleague Nik De hinted at in his new crypto regulation newsletter The State of Crypto, is almost too much to ask for. It doesn’t guarantee crypto-friendly legislation, but at least it means the discourse will be relatively well informed.

· “While it is nigh on impossible to forecast an expected return for bitcoin, its volatility makes the asset almost ‘uninvestable’ from a portfolio perspective.” – Barclays Private Bank chief market strategist Gerald Moser, talking to Financial News. He goes on to claim that the current bull run has been driven by retail investors rather than institutional money, which is a bewildering interpretation of the data.

· Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, who recently said that he thought bitcoin’s fair value could reach $400,000, has been looking at the BTC charts and now believes that the cryptocurrency could be in for a sell-off down to $20,000.

· Bill Miller featured bitcoin in his Q4 income strategy letter, and his son talks about the fund’s investment in the MicroStrategy convertible security. “The world is ruled by fat-tail events, or seemingly improbable occurrences that have an outsized impact, and all indicators so far point to Bitcoin being one.”

· “You know what, if you won the lottery – Yes, I’m gonna say it – 5% in bitcoin.” – Jim Cramer, host of the Mad Money program. Cramer apparently sees bitcoin as an “important new store of value.”

Takeaways:

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $7.81 trillion under management, appears to have granted at least two of its funds (BlackRock Global Allocation Fund Inc. and BlackRock Funds V) the ability to invest in bitcoin futures, according to prospectus documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. TAKEAWAY: For now, the funds will only be able to invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures, not actually hold bitcoin. And we shouldn’t assume that BlackRock will be betting on upside – it could use bitcoin futures to express bearish positions. But this move does echo comments made last month by CEO Larry Fink, when he said bitcoin could possibly “evolve” into a global market asset. And it is encouraging to see official acknowledgement that the world’s largest asset manager has invested resources in understanding the market.

If any of you heard some alarming chatter about a double-spend on the Bitcoin network (when a certain amount of BTC is spent twice, which in theory is impossible), here is an explanation of what really happened and how it’s nothing to worry about.

While bitcoin is still usually the first crypto investment for professional investors, due largely to its relative liquidity and range of onramps and services, Ethereum’s native token ether is starting to attract more institutional attention. A report from Fundstrat Global Advisors posits that the wide array of potential use cases for Ethereum gives ETH the best risk/reward scenario in the market, and believes that the asset could rally up to $10,500. TAKEAWAY: ETH has outperformed BTC for eight of the past 12 months (and looks set to do the same for this one), yet it is currently below its all-time high (ATH), while BTC left its ATH in the dust three months and 52% ago (at time of writing). It is not easy to directly compare the two, however, since the underlying technology, use case outlook and risk profile are very different. We’ll be following this closely, so watch this space. (See our report on Eth 2.0 for more detail on its upcoming protocol shift.)

U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen got off on the wrong foot with the cryptocurrency community by claiming that bitcoin was mainly used for illicit financing. This happened on the same day that blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis published a report that shows that cryptocurrency-based criminal activity fell to 0.34% of total transaction volume, down from 2.1% in 2019. TAKEAWAY: That doesn’t look like “mainly” to me. Thankfully, she rectified shortly after in a written response to the Senate Finance Committee, stressing the need to “encourage their use for legitimate activities while curtailing their use for malign and illegal activities.” That sounds more reasonable.

London-based crypto liquidity provider Wintermute has raised $20 million in a Series B funding round, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from Pantera Capital, Sino Global Capital, Kenetic Capital, Rockaway Blockchain Fund, Hack VC, DeFi Alliance and Fidelity-affiliated Avon Ventures. TAKEAWAY: Most of the meaningful raises we’ve seen recently have been for market infrastructure firms, which points to strong under-the-surface development and increasing sophistication from crypto markets, and expectations of significant growth in service demand.

Sen. Mike Flood (R) of Nebraska has introduced two bills that would allow the state’s banks to offer custodial services for digital assets. TAKEAWAY: Several states are likely to follow Wyoming’s lead in making their jurisdictions crypto asset-friendly. This will not just attract new businesses or retain existing ones in an industry with growth potential. It could also serve to attract investment funds, and enhance the opportunities for interstate crypto commerce and business deals.

Market research commissioned by trading platform eToro, which surveyed 25 large institutions in Q3, revealed that interest in crypto markets from pensions and endowments is increasing. TAKEAWAY: This would be a big shift if it materializes, as pensions and endowments are traditionally risk-averse investors. Crypto markets, as we were reminded this week, are not for the risk-averse. It’s a relatively small sample, and so can’t be taken as indicative of pending inflows, but it does hint at a shift in market perception.

According to a Deutsche Bank survey of market professionals, over 50% believe that BTC is at a 10 on a 1-10 “bubble scale”, and is likely to halve in value over the next 12 months. TAKEAWAY: Is this a sign of the market getting tired? Or, a sign of growing awareness amongst people who have yet to do research?

JPMorgan strategists have said in a report that a bitcoin price breakout over $40,000 would require daily inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC; Grayscale is owned by DCG, also parent of CoinDesk) of approximately $100 million. TAKEAWAY: So far, that does not look too farfetched: On Monday, the firm had its largest daily inflow ever, almost $700 million, bringing the daily average since it reopened for new investment last week to approximately $200 million.

Digital asset management firm CoinShares has launched an exchange-traded bitcoin product (ETP) on Swiss stock exchange SIX. TAKEAWAY: It is becoming increasingly obvious how much livelier in terms of variety the listed crypto product landscape is in Europe vs the US.

Valkyrie Digital Assets filed an application this week for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, which would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. TAKEAWAY: This is the second bitcoin ETF filing we’ve seen in the past three weeks, and is probably the first of many in 2021. With Gary Gensler as nominated head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, expectations are rising that the industry will see a bitcoin ETF approved this year.","Nasdaq-Listed Crypto Firm Sued, Accused of Defrauding Investors With Fake Bitcoin Mining Business

A class-action lawsuit has been filed against a Nasdaq-listed bitcoin mining company. The suit cites a report claiming that the business is “completely fraudulent,” with nonexistent bitcoin mining operations.

Lawsuit Alleges Crypto Firm’s Bitcoin Mining Business Is ‘Completely Fraudulent’

A class-action lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in the Southern District Court of New York against Bit Digital Inc., its CEO Min Hu, and CFO Erke Huang.

Bit Digital, a holding company listed on Nasdaq under the symbol BTBT, purports to engage in bitcoin mining business through its U.S. and Hong Kong subsidiaries. Its name was changed from Golden Bull Ltd. (ticker DNJR) in September 2020.

The lawsuit cites a report by J Capital Research released on Jan. 11 alleging that Bit Digital operates “a fake cryptocurrency business,” which is “designed to steal funds from investors.”

J Capital alleges that Bit Digital’s claim that “it was operating 22,869 bitcoin miners in China” is “simply not possible.” The research firm stated that it had “verified with local governments supposedly hosting the BTBT mining operation that there are no bitcoin miners there,” adding:

We think the bitcoin business BTBT discloses is completely fraudulent.

Plaintiff Anthony Pauwels, individually and on behalf of all others who purchased Bit Digital securities between Dec. 21, 2020, and Jan. 8, accuses the defendants of violating the federal securities laws. They said that the defendants “made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company’s business, operations, and prospects.”

Following the publication of J Capital’s report, “Bit Digital’s stock price fell $6.27 per share, or 25%, to close at $18.76 per share on January 11, 2021, on unusually heavy trading volume,” the lawsuit details.

Local Chinese Authorities Never Heard of the Company

Bit Digital had previously declared, “Our mining operations are in Wuhai, Zhundong, Xinlinhot and Sichuan, China.”

J Capital explained that “In China, you have to register with the government to have a data center, and local governments have records of all data centers and bitcoin mining operations.” The research firm further noted that “without a Chinese-registered entity, that would not be legal.” Moreover, “Companies are required to show a registration document from a domestic legal entity before they can sign a lease or a hosting contract. Yet the company clearly claims that it both operates and leases mining facilities in China.”

To verify Bit Digital’s claims, J Capital contacted the governments of these regions. “In telephone calls, local government officials of each locality told us they had no bitcoin mining operations and had not heard of Bit Digital,” J Capital described.

An official of Zhundong told J Capital: “Big data, cryptocurrency, cloud computing parks or data centers — none of these have registered here.” An official of Xilinhot also confirmed, “There is no bitcoin center here.” Similarly, an official of Wuhai told J Capital:

There’s no bitcoin center here. I’ve never heard of Bit Digital.

Mining Rig Manufacturers Also ‘Drew a Blank’

To verify that Bit Digital had the bitcoin miners it claims, J Capital said it spoke with “all the major manufacturers in China of bitcoin mining equipment” but “None had heard of BTBT.”

An employee of Microbt, a mining rig manufacturer from which BTBT said it bought 21,713 machines in 2020, told J Capital that BTBT had not purchased equipment from them. “I have never heard of Bit Digital,” he said. “We provided the name of the company’s former VIE with no better result,” J Capital clarified.

Bit Digital also said that it bought 256 miners from Bitmain in the first nine months of 2020. However, J Capital said that Bitmain “drew a blank” when inquired about BTBT.

Bit Digital Claims False Accusations

Bit Digital Inc. responded to the accusations on Tuesday, claiming that they are false. “Since we never purchased any brand new miners from suppliers in 2020 they would not know of the company or of its subsidiaries,” the company claims. Bit Digital additionally affirmed that, as disclosed in its third-quarter financial results on Dec. 18, 2020, it owned 40,865 bitcoin miners.

In addition, the company said: “We have not signed leases for bitcoin mining facilities. In order to achieve lower utility costs, the mining facilities are maintained by our third-party suppliers … The bitcoin mining facilities in China are maintained by Hong Kong suppliers.” Furthermore, Bit Digital explained that it acquired Xmax Hong Kong, and “All of the bitcoin mining operations in mainland China are conducted by Xmax Hong Kong.”

The plaintiff and the class are seeking “compensatory damages,” “reasonable costs and expenses incurred in this action, including counsel fees and expert fees,” and “Such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.”

Bitcoin, BTC to USD, slid by 9.97% in the week ending 24th January. Following on from a 6.02% decline from the previous week, Bitcoin ended the week at $32,320.0.

A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin rise to a Tuesday intraweek high $37,936.6 before hitting reverse.

Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $40,389, Bitcoin slid to a Friday intraweek low $28,989.0.

The sell-off saw Bitcoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $33,008 and the first major support level at $31,023.

It was Bitcoin’s first visit to sub-$30,000 levels since 5th January.

Finding support on Friday, Bitcoin broke back through the 23.6% FIB before ending the day at sub-$32,500 levels.

4 days in the red that included an 13.08% tumble on Thursday delivered the downside for the week.

For the week ahead

Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $33,008 and the $33,082 pivot to support a run the first major resistance level at $37,175.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $37,000 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and last week’s high $37,936.6 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended breakout, Bitcoin could test resistance at the swing hi $41,969 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $42,029.

Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB and the $33,082 pivot would bring the first major support level at $28,227 into play.

Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of the second major support level at $24,134. The 38.2% FIB of $27,465 should limit the downside in the event of an extended sell-off.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.68% to $32,863.4. A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin fall to an early Monday low $32,253.0 before rising to a high $32,919.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested at the start of the week.

Ethereum

Ethereum rose by 13.09% in the week ending 24th January. Reversing a 1.76% loss from the previous week, Ethereum ended the week at $1,394.00.

Story continues

It was a bullish start to the week. Ethereum rose to a Tuesday intraweek high and a new swing hi $1,440.0 before hitting reverse.

The breakout saw Ethereum break through the first major resistance level before sliding to a Friday intraweek low $1,039.62.

While steering clear of the first major support level at $994, Ethereum fell through the 23.6% FIB of $1,119.

A recovery on Friday and a bullish weekend, however, saw Ethereum break back through the 23.6% FIB to end the week at $1,390 levels.

6-days in the green included an 8.71% rally on Tuesday, an 11.07% jump on Friday, and a 12.92% breakout on Sunday delivered the upside in the week. A 19.34% slump on Thursday pared some of the gains, however.

For the week ahead

Ethereum would need to avoid a fall through the pivot level at $1,291 to support a run at the first major resistance level at $1,543.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break through to $1,500 levels.

Barring another extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended breakout, Ethereum could test resistance at $1,750 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $1,692.

Failure to avoid a fall through the pivot level at $1,291 would bring the first major support level at $1,142 and the 23.6% FIB of $1,119 into play.

Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ethereum should steer clear of the 38.2% FIB of $921 and the second major support level at $891.

At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 3.31% to $1,440.19. A mixed start to the week saw Ethereum fall to an early Monday low $1,384.15 before striking a new swing hi $1,477.30.

Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested at the start of the week.

More From FXEMPIRE:","From Brazil to Nigeria, people turn to Bitcoin for different reasons than most of their speculating counterparts in North America. Namely, because it’s the most advantageous way for them to conduct international transactions.

Such is the case with a 28-year-old poker player in Brazil who simply goes by Felipe, for safety. Poker is a legal form of gambling in Brazil, so Felipe can use Brazilian banks and regulated exchanges to earn income from home. He dropped out of law school because playing poker against foreigners with Bitcoin to spend was more profitable than becoming a partner at a local law firm. Felipe said he now outearns his brother, a middle-tier executive at one of Brazil’s top corporations.

“Bitcoin is the best medium of money exchange in the poker community,” Felipe said. “I withdraw earnings as Bitcoin, or as Tether, to a Brazilian crypto exchange and sell it there.”

Felipe said he is wary of his government because he believes the Brazilian economy will experience a catastrophic shock in the next few years. Back in 1992, President Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached after confiscating millions of civilian savings accounts to offset national debts. Felipe doesn’t want his bank account forcibly emptied when the next crisis hits. This inspires him to accumulate Bitcoin, avoiding more traditional options stocks.

“The pension funds system is completely broken,” Felipe added. “The thing with Bitcoin is, you don’t need it until you do.”

Manuel Folgueiras is one of many Cuban users who joined the Bitcoin ecosystem over the past year. This 33-year-old economist, who lost his tourism industry job in 2020, now supports himself using various cryptocurrency projects.

“It’s very difficult to get Bitcoin, because we don’t have access to any exchanges and there are a lot of scams. Cuban banks don’t have relationships with crypto exchanges,” Folgueiras said. “Now I use Bitcoin for both savings and income, through trading arbitrage. We have to use a VPN and it’s very risky. If the exchange detects that you’re from Cuba, your account will get blocked.”

Global demand for Bitcoin has been surging since the pandemic began in 2020, pushing dollar-denominated prices briefly past $34,000 during the first week of January, 2021. For residents in many emerging markets, demand for Bitcoin is driven by concerns about the overall health of their national economies, not pure speculation. Some of these countries where Bitcoin markets are spiking, especially in Latin America and the Middle East, are seeing their domestic economies tailspin and are worried political controls could further threaten economic stability.

For example, since Western Union stopped operating in Cuba, more Cubans are using Bitcoin than ever before. For people in a variety of countries, pandemic policy changes reduced access to the dollar-centric financial system.

Folgueiras estimated he is one of roughly 80,000 people on the island involved in an unofficial brokerage business called Trust Investing, often called a Ponzi scheme by local technologists. In short, the business promises to trade cryptocurrency on behalf of “investors,” to whom they deposit lucrative returns. The project promises 200% returns, which seems impossible, and references questionable “partners” on the Trust Investing website.

Those partner companies are registered to people associated with a variety of court cases across Latin America and, both Panama’s Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores (SMV) and Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) published warnings not to trust the Trust Investing company itself. Even Folgueiras acknowledged that many people call this business a scam. But he said returns from the Trust Investing program are helping him survive the abysmal job market. It’s a gamble whether the company will give him returns or run away with his money, a risk he’s willing to take.

Plus, Folgueiras added, any form of Bitcoin business in Cuba is already “very risky.” There aren’t many regulated, trustworthy exchanges openly serving Cubans today, due to U.S. sanctions. Aside from the remittance startup, BitRemesas, the last compliance-oriented startup that tried serving this market shut down in 2019. As such, many Cubans turn to questionable schemes, or WhatsApp, instead.

“Cubans get Bitcoin via WhatsApp groups, peer-to-peer trading. The most popular mobile wallets are Coinomi, Enjin Wallet and Trust Wallet, because most people in Cuba only use a cell phone. It’s a mobile-only market,” Folgueiras said. “Bitcoin changed my life in a positive way and became an important source of income. Cryptocurrencies are also an interesting way for Cubans to shop online and send international payments or remittances.”

This grassroots, mobile-only environment is common across many small countries with underdeveloped economics. Likewise, Fodé Diop, founder of the Dakar Bitcoin Developers meetup in Senegal, told CoinDesk last year that Senegal was not just a mobile-first market; it’s a mobile-only Bitcoin scene. Unlike North America and Europe, many emerging-market crypto communities only use cell phones for everything from research and trading to storage.

On the other hand, it would be a mistake to assume most emerging-market Bitcoin users are marginalized by the global banking system. To the contrary, in countries like Nigeria and Brazil, many upper-middle-class entrepreneurs and gamers use Bitcoin to conduct perfectly legal business. According to data from the global peer-to-peer (P2P) markets LocalBitcoins and Paxful, there were more than $25.3 million worth of P2P Bitcoin trades last year in Brazil alone.

Meanwhile, in Africa, Nigerian P2P Bitcoin volumes dwarf those numbers with a cool $357 million. Likewise, BuyCoins co-founder Tomiwa Lasebikan said his Nigerian cryptocurrency exchange ballooned from an average of $5 million in monthly volume in December 2019 to $21 million by December 2020.

He said several factors spurred local growth, including anti-police brutality activists like the Nigerian Feminist Coalition, which collected bitcoin donations after being denied banking access, and stricter banking limitations on Nigerians paying for international services.

“A lot of people in Nigeria are running into a problem that they couldn’t renew subscriptions, like Spotify or Amazon, with their Nigerian accounts,” Lasebikan said. “Then, in October, there was a whole lot of interest in cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin, for aggregating donations for people protesting police brutality. A lot of activists had their bank accounts shut down. Continued fundraising like this, both inside and outside the country, would not have been possible two decades ago.”

He added his exchange startup now serves roughly 12,000 active users a month. Nearby, Binance communications lead in Africa, Damilola Odufuwa, said her global exchange company facilitated hundreds of virtual events for 70,000 Nigerian crypto beginners in 2020. These educational programs covered basic terminology, trading strategies and guides to opening exchange accounts.

“During the pandemic, it was hard to get things into the country, including remittances,” Odufuwa said. “Now there’s also this need to use cryptocurrency to donate [to activists]…we plan to at least quadruple educational programming this year.”

Depending on the user’s socioeconomic background, people use Bitcoin to earn income from online games like poker, trading cryptocurrencies or offering freelance services to international clients. Odufuwa said thousands of the new users she’s seen during the pandemic want to profit from their developer skills, not just trades. So her company will offer more developer training related to the open-source Binance Smart Chain project. Although it’s impossible to accurately quantify, it seems as though at least hundreds of freelancers around the globe now depend on Bitcoin for income.

One such LocalBitcoins user in Latin American, Venezuelan journalist José Rafael Peña, has been earning the majority of his income in Bitcoin since late 2016. He estimated that cryptocurrency writing gigs account for 90% of his income.

“Bitcoin, in some circumstances, is a very helpful tool, especially when you live in a country with a chaotic economy and limited financial tools,” Peña said. “I began using Bitcoin because it let me protect against the bolivar’s devaluation, even without a dollar bank account.”

All things considered, Odufuwa said emerging markets saw “tremendous” growth since the pandemic began. But Peña warned not to confuse that growth with a mainstream “solution” to local government woes.

“Most people try to survive the crisis in any way,” he said. “Even here, crypto is a niche.”","In a busy week for news, let’s take a look back at the biggest stories from the worlds of forex, fintech, and crypto, in our best of the week segment.

Spain Is Fed up with Cypriot Brokers’ Practices, CySEC Warns

In a circular to its regulated investment Firms (CIFs), CySEC drew the attention of firms that provide investment services in Spain towards a recent statement released by its financial regulator.

The CNMV issued a circular that adopted an aggressive tone and threatened some European brokers that they could end up closing their activity in Spain, as the watchdog was fed up with their unfair practices. In essence, the guidance concerns companies that offer forex, contracts for difference (CFDs), and other speculative products among retail investors in Spain.

At the time, the Spanish regulatory body said it mainly examines CFD brokers based in Cyprus, and that it has its sights set on those who use overly aggressive tactics and practices.

Analysis: How New Tax Law Could Kill CFDs Trading in Germany

Finance Magnates delved deep into the German trading scene this week.

German investors trading a variety of derivatives products are subject to new capital gains taxes following an amended law that was pushed almost secretly through the Bundestag during 2020 Christmas holidays.

The legislative proposal went initially unnoticed when it was first introduced and then passed more than a year ago. But, shortly after, it made a lot of noise as the new regulation drastically limits the ability of individual traders to offset their losses against profits they earn from derivative transactions.

2021-01-25,"Bill Gates is quite annoyed with the use of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies as he had suffered a massive loss while using Bitcoin in his company as a primary mode of transactions.

The Microsoft owner is not consistent about his opinion on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies.

The opinion of this great entrepreneur keeps on changing over time. This aspect of frequent changes in the statement is quite natural in to incase of Cryptocurrency trading. One thing that remains constant about Cryptocurrency from the standpoint of Bill Gates is the Blockchain Technology application.

Different Opinion of Bill Gates on Bitcoin in Cryptocurrencies

Over time, the opinion of Bill Gates changes over Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. Let’s explore the different views of one person on Cryptocurrency in this article.

1. Cryptocurrency Causing Deaths at A Fair Means

Bill Gates initially had the opinion that Cryptocurrency is an anonymous form of currency. There is no regulating authority that can control the Bitcoin transactions over the network. Cryptocurrency is growing in popularity along with it; unscrupulous elements of society are using it in an unfair means.

Many Crypto traders are not aware that they are causing deaths to millions of people directly as there are no regulations in Cryptocurrencies’ transactions. Untraceable Cryptocurrencies are now causing many deaths as drug dealers, terrorist organizations, and other antisocial people are now using them.

In Bill Gates’s opinion, it has become quite clear that Gates is pessimistic about cryptocurrency’s, and he is not very sure of the outcomes and the hazards it may cause in the world economy in the future.

2. Cryptocurrencies Are Anonymous

According to Bill Gates, Cryptocurrencies are the anonymous form of currencies. He also said that the chances of tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist funding could be increased due to the maximum usage of the Cryptocurrency.

The usage of Bitcoin and other high-value Cryptocurrencies can lead to money misuse if not appropriately regulated. Due to the lack of monitoring of Cryptocurrency, the chances of death are increasing in many countries. People are not habituated to digital transactions of vast amounts of money, so the chances of cyber issues may also increase.

Bill Gates is also of the opinion that it is super risky to invest your money in Bitcoin or other Cryptocurrencies right now. The security issues are more, and the safety measures are less in it. You can go through https://ethereum-code.me to get more insight into his opinion on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies.

3. Digital Currencies Can Empower the Poorest

Bill Gates also said that Cryptocurrency transactions are now like get the rich quick scheme. The price of many high-value currencies like Bitcoins, Ethereum is increasing at a rapid pace. It is giving birth to many billionaires all over the world. The scope of the earning capacity is also relatively high.

He mentioned that 2.5 billion people worldwide lack access to financial services. You need to be well aware of the fact that the application of digital currency can reduce the poverty rate in the world with ease.

Here, we notice that the same person has a difference in Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoins’ opinion over time. You need to compare the difference of opinion of Bill Gates. It is quite natural as, with time, the value of many Cryptocurrencies is performing well in the market.

Why Is Bill Gates Changing His Opinion About Cryptocurrency?

The value of Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is changing all the time, and currently, its value is on the higher side. Bitcoin prices are now touching the sky, and in 2014 -2015 Bitcoin value is very fluctuating. But now it is reflecting steady growth. It is the reason why Bill Gates is changing his opinion frequently on Cryptocurrency.

Conclusion

Hence, from the above discussion, it has become clear that Bill Gates is not consistent in Cryptocurrency’s opinion. Like the volatility rate of Cryptocurrency, the opinion of Bill gates is also volatile. It also gets fluctuated all the time. If you want to believe him, then you can but before that, consider the market fluctuations.","Why did this happen?

Bitcoin's price rose on Monday after a brutal sell-off that saw the virtual currency briefly dip below $30,000. Meanwhile, ether — the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency — hit a fresh record high. Bitcoin rose more than 7.4% in the last 24 hours to trade around $34,807, according to data from CoinDesk, looking to recover from steep losses last week that wiped out more than $100 billion from the entire crypto market.

Ether, the digital token of the Ethereum blockchain, notched a new all-time high of $1,476 early Monday morning. The cryptocurrency climbed 6.2% to a price of $1,415 at about 9:15 a.m. ET. Altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies, have been known to rally in times of strength for bitcoin. Ether's latest price movement was attributed to increased use of Ethereum — its underlying network that is undergoing a major upgrade — and interest from institutional investors in crypto.","Bitcoin (BTC) was higher on Monday at around $33,000, rebounding after a 9.9% drop in the seven days through Sunday, the biggest weekly drop since August.

“Bitcoin is seeing some consolidation itself after surviving another run at $30,000,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the London-based foreign exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Monday in an investor update. “A move back above $35,000 may start to change the conversation but the trend is against it these last few weeks and a move lower still looks more likely.”

Ether (ETH), the main cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, rose early Monday to a new all-time high price of $1,476.12. Ether, which is the second-biggest digital asset by market value after bitcoin, has nearly doubled just in January alone.

“Given the dip from bitcoin and the steadiness of [ether], we could see investors move capital into the latter as they look for the next crypto asset that is going to perform in the current bull run,” David Derhy, an analyst with the trading platform eToro, said in emailed comments.

In traditional markets, Asian and European shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open as investors weighed the odds of more economic stimulus. Gold strengthened 0.4% to $1,864 an ounce.

Market moves

Bitcoin is coming off its worst week in almost five months, but the main takeaway, according to veteran digital-market traders and analysts, is that it wasn’t really all that bad.

A quick glance at price charts shows that declines at least as large as last week’s 9.9% retreat have happened nine times in the past two years.

And the cryptocurrency’s price has risen so dramatically and consistently over the period that those prior corrections almost look quaint. The worst sell-off in recent memory was the 33.5% weekly plunge in March 2020, when the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus became clear to global investors. But in absolute dollar terms, that $2,690 drop was less than last week’s $3,950 loss, showing just how far bitcoin’s price has climbed since then.

According to Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange, buyers appeared to materialize last week whenever prices fell to about $30,000. That’s just above the $29,112 level where bitcoin started off the year, following a 2020 when it quadrupled in price.

“While 10%+ drawdowns shake conviction, these moves have been met with strong bids,” Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency analysis firm, told clients Friday in a note. “Shaking out profit takers and ‘weak hands’ is necessary for BTC to make strides upwards.”

According to Chainalysis, a blockchain-analysis firm, bitcoin’s recent rally to new record highs above $40,000 may have been too much to resist for speculators who have only recently nosed into the cryptocurrency arena, lured by the outsize returns of recent years.

“New buyer behavior is still a major source of medium-term price volatility and is currently elevated,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist for New York-based Chainalysis, wrote Friday. “It is important to restate that the bitcoin price is still at historically very high levels.”

Ryan Selkis, CEO of the digital-markets analysis firm Messari, wrote that last week’s tumble “looked like a nice little dip for new buyers, and a wealth transfer from some of the weakest-handed sellers I’ve seen in crypto to those with an actual investment thesis.”

Data extracted from the bitcoin blockchain network show the number of addresses with at least 1,000 or more bitcoins increased last week – an indication that large institutional buyers may have been stepping into the market as prices dipped, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported Friday.

“The buying pressure seen in the lower bounds of the current range have been solid,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, told clients early Monday in a note. “The selling pressure above is in no way weaker. If bulls manage to break out, though, the move to the next level ($34,855) could be explosive and even take us further, back to the upper $38Ks.”

The upshot? Further downside might still be in store, but the limited scope of last week’s price decline reveals plenty of demand for bitcoin at levels well above prices that prevailed in 2020.

The bitcoin market is showing signs of weakening demand from U.S.-based institutions, according to Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital.

Comparing bitcoin’s price moves during Asia daytime hours and American hours (split into 12 hours each) shows a clear pattern of relentless buying during the North American trading hours and selling in Asia, mainly by large investors (known as whales) and cryptocurrency miners.

The pattern emerged following the March 2020 price crash and had endured until two weeks ago when bitcoin reached record highs above $41,900. Since then, the strength during U.S. hours has lost momentum, QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel.

The flat-to-negative “Coinbase Premium” – the spread between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair, which includes the stablecoin tether – also suggests absence of strong demand from high-net-worth individuals and institutions.

“I’ll keep my bearish bias until there are significant Coinbase premium and Coinbase outflow,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, tweeted on Sunday. “BTC needs [U.S. dollar] spot inflows from institutional investors to start the next bull run.”

As such, odds appear stacked against the cryptocurrency keeping gains above $33,000.

“We could be in for a classic ‘W’ bottom when the first bounce off the lows is met by another batch of selling before it eventually bounces back for real,” David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of the Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.

Key Takeaways The ETH:BTC ratio is currently at 0.042, its highest level in over two years.

In June 2017, the ratio hit an all-time high of 0.14.

Bitcoin still holds 62% dominance over the market. A ratio of 0.164 would be needed for Ethereum to overtake Bitcoin’s market cap today.

The ETH:BTC ratio between Ethereum and Bitcoin is climbing.

Ethereum hit a new all-time high of $1,445 last night, pushing the ETH:BTC ratio to 0.044. It’s now hovering at 0.042.

“The Flippening” Still A Long Way Off

The last time the ratio was at this level was in August 2018.

The ratio is of particular interest to traders as it essentially tracks how many Ether it would cost to buy one Bitcoin. At 0.042, 1 Bitcoin is worth roughly 24 Ether.

The current level bodes well for Ethereum, hitting new record highs over the last few days. In the last seven days, Bitcoin is down 6.8%, while Ether has registered a 15.1% gain.

Nonetheless, the ratio is way short of the levels it’s been in the past. In January 2018, it crossed 0.1. That was when Bitcoin had surged to $19,600 the previous month and was beginning to cool off, while Ether climbed to a high of $1,420.

Similarly, a few months before that, in June 2017, the ratio hit an all-time high of 0.14. It led to calls for “The Flippening”—an event where Ethereum would overtake Bitcoin’s market cap. For that to happen today, the ratio would need to be closer to 0.164, meaning a price of around $5,450 for Ether.

Though significantly short in price for “The Flippening,” Ethereum has passed Bitcoin on other key metrics. Several dedicated analytics sites are currently tracking the two assets’ performance, showing that the total transactions and transaction fees on Ethereum are higher than that of Bitcoin.

Ethereum’s current market cap is $162 billion—roughly 26% of Bitcoin’s $621 billion. Bitcoin holds around 62% of the total cryptocurrency market cap dominance, while Ethereum trails with only 16%.

Disclosure: At the time of writing, the author of this feature owned ETH, among a number of other cryptocurrencies.

Total assets under management (AUM) in the industry slipped to $29.7 billion as of Jan. 22, from an all-time peak of $34.4 billion on Jan. 8. At the end of 2019, the total AUM was just $2 billion.

Grayscale, the world’s largest digital currency manager, posted assets under management of $24 billion last week, down from $28.2 billion on Jan. 8. CoinShares, the second largest crypto fund, managed assets of $2.9 billion in the latest week, also down from $3.4 billion on Jan. 8.

“We believe investors have been very price conscious this year due to the speed at which prices in bitcoin achieved new highs,” said James Butterfill, investment strategist, at CoinShares.

“The recent price weakness, prompted by recent comments from Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Janet Yellen and the unfounded concerns of a double spend, now look to have been a buying opportunity with inflows breaking all-time weekly inflows,” he added.

Bitcoin dropped to a low of $28,800 on Friday, after scaling an all-time peak of $42,000 on Jan.8. It was last down 0.5% at $32,124.

About 97% of inflows went to bitcoin, the data showed, with Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, posting inflows of $34 million last week.

So far this year, volumes in bitcoin have been considerably higher, trading an average of $12.3 billion per day, compared to $2.2 billion in 2020.

Glassnode, which provides insight on blockchain data, said in a report on Monday that bitcoin’s net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) was getting close to exceeding the “belief” range and moving into the “euphoria” range.

Previously, when NUPL entered this range, it signaled a global top in bitcoin’s price.","Cryptocurrency mining company Marathon Patent Group (MARA) bought $150 million in bitcoin for around $31,100 apiece during the crypto asset’s recent price rout.

The Nasdaq-listed firm said Monday it purchased the cryptocurrency through institutional bitcoin shop NYDIG. Marathon is the latest publicly traded company to swap a cash treasury for bitcoin, and, with 4,812.66 BTC now on the books, one of the largest by sheer investment size.

Marathon CEO Merrick Okamoto said in a statement the bitcoin buy “accelerates” his mining company’s transformation into a “pure-play bitcoin investment option” for crypto-hungry Wall Street traders.

Wall Street traders already have a few options on that front, some more creative than others. There’s Square, the payments company and Cash App owner with 4,702 BTC. And there’s Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has purchased over 600,000 BTC for its investors, many institutional. (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group).

But Nasdaq’s flashiest indirect bitcoin exposure vehicle is perhaps business intelligence company MicroStrategy, whose semi-regular bitcoin buys (it now holds 70,784 coins) have wooed investors, and boosted MSTR’s share price 370% since July.

Bitcoin mining company stocks have tracked with the market-leading crypto asset’s recent price boom. But Marathon’s investment strengthens its ties even further, seeking to peg its appeal even more tightly to bitcoin with the investment.

While fellow public crypto miners Riot Blockchain and Hut 8 (a Canadian firm) also hold bitcoin on their balance sheet, those larger miners amassed their troves by mining and holding, not, like Marathon, through a direct investment model.

They’ve been more successful by the numbers. In Q3 2020 Riot reported $2.4 million in mining revenue and Hut 8 disclosed $4 million. Marathon’s far smaller mining fleet generated just $835,184 in revenue in the same period.

The bitcoin mining industry is now going through what Okamoto has called an “arms race” for new rigs. More mining machines means more mining power means more potential bitcoin, and Marathon is racing to catch up.

Marathon entered 2021 on a cash-raising tear as CEO Okamoto raced to win the mining rig “arms race.” Determined to push its rig count above 103,000 by next year, the company raised $200 million in early January and an additional $250 million just over a week later. Okamoto has said the capital infusions will fund business expansions.

The company will not reach its target mining capacity anytime soon. In the interim, it’s leveraging its cash “to invest in bitcoin now,” Okamoto said.","Why did this happen?

Kirsty O'Connor/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo

LONDON (Reuters) - No existing cryptocurrency has a structure that is likely to allow it to work as a means of payment over the long term, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told an online forum hosted by the Davos-based World Economic Forum on Monday.

“Have we landed on what I would call the design, governance and arrangements for what I might call a lasting digital currency? No, I don’t think we’re there yet, honestly. I don’t think cryptocurrencies as originally formulated are it,” he said.

Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, hit a record high of $42,000 on Jan. 8 and sank as low as $28,800 last week, far greater volatility than is found with normal currencies.

“The whole question of people having assurance that their payments will be made in something with stable value ... ultimately links bank to what we call fiat currency, which has a link to the state,” Bailey said.

The BoE, like the European Central Bank, is looking at the feasibility of issuing its own digital currency. This would allow people to make sterling electronic payments without involving banks, as is currently possible with banknotes, and would in theory help avoid the volatility that renders bitcoin impractical for commerce.

Bailey said the appropriate level of privacy for digital currencies was likely to be hotly debated and was potentially underrated as a challenge in setting one up.

“This is a big one that is coming on to the landscape, the whole question of a privacy standard for transactions made in any form of digital currency, and where the public interest lies,” he said."
2021-01-26,"The cryptocurrency market is looking for a firm regulatory framework. Governments around the world are trying to figure out whether bitcoin is a currency, a tradable commodity, a security on par with stocks and options, or a brand new asset class of its own. Once they figure that one out, they'll have to ask the same questions about Ethereum, Tether, Ripple, and Cardano, and the list of major cryptocurrencies only grows longer over time. Settling the thorny issues of legality, taxation, and trading rules will take time, adding to the uncertainty and volatility of the global crypto market.

President Biden is putting together a team of financial leaders that should clarify the tricky cryptocurrency market in a hurry. Three of Biden's top-level financial staff picks have a proven understanding of how blockchain and cryptocurrency assets actually work.

The view from the top

Let's start with our next U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen.

In last week's written testimony, given as part of Yellen's nomination process, she said that cryptocurrencies offer both benefits and challenges to the American financial system.

""I think it important we consider the benefits of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, and the potential they have to improve the efficiency of the financial system,"" Yellen wrote. ""At the same time, we know they can be used to finance terrorism, facilitate money laundering, and support malign activities that threaten U.S. national security interests and the integrity of the U.S. and international financial systems.""

Many headlines focused on the terrorism issue, ignoring Yellen's more positive view of digital assets as a source of efficiency and innovation. She pledged to do a deep review of cryptocurrency markets in collaboration with many other banking and finance regulators, hoping to establish an effective set of rules that limits ""malign and illegal activities"" while supporting powerful fintech innovations based on blockchain technologies.

Yellen's views on bitcoin have been nuanced and sophisticated for a while. At the height of the last bitcoin peak in 2017, when Yellen served at the chair of the Federal Reserve, she said that she wasn't a fan of the cryptocurrency while also acknowledging that the crypto market was in need of a stable framework of regulations and monitoring.

In short, it looks like Yellen will do her level best to come up with a reasonable legal framework for bitcoin and friends, accepting inputs and ideas from many different stakeholders.

Biden's cryptocurrency experts

At least two of Biden's top-level financial leadership picks come with serious backgrounds in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.

Gary Gensler, who has been tapped to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is professor of the Practice of Global Economics and Management at MIT's Sloan School of Management. His research and teaching duties focus on financial technologies, blockchain technology, digital currencies, and public policy. That doesn't make him a single-minded cryptocurrency supporter. Gensler also has direct experience from the legislative angle, having assisted Senator Paul Sarbanes in the writing of the important Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Gensler provides a unique balance of cryptocurrency knowledge and traditional finance experience that should help Yellen build an equally balanced regulatory model.

Over the weekend, Biden reportedly selected Georgetown University law professor Chris Brummer for another high-level financial post. As chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Brummer will advise Yellen and also develop a regulatory approach to treating some cryptocurrencies as commodities. Brummer also teaches cryptocurrency classes and is often called by Congress and global regulators as an expert witness on digital currencies. He is another deeply informed expert on the legal and financial aspects of cryptocurrencies, and another valuable resource for crafting an effective ruleset.

The leadership lineup under Trump was a mixed bag when it comes to understanding the crypto markets.

SEC ex-chairman Jay Clayton filed a lawsuit against the cross-border digital payments system Ripple on his last day of service, raising questions that would have made more sense five years ago and effectively halting Ripple's surging price growth.

Former CFTC chairman Heath Tarber came with a stellar legal background and argued that the U.S. needs to remain a global leader in blockchain technology.

Perhaps the largest change here comes at the very top, where former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin drew heavy criticism from cryptocurrency insiders with his privacy-hostile regulatory proposals.

What to expect from the new team

The new team brings stellar credentials to the table along with their stated support for reasonable cryptocurrency regulations. I don't know how quickly they can develop a stable rulebook for the long term, but they do seem well-equipped to get the job done. Come back in four years and I think you'll find that the questions of legal challenges and financial rules around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will have faded away. The new rules may not always favor the current players of the fintech market but regulatory stability will be good news for the market as a whole.

That should help investors in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and CleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) sleep better at night, not to mention those of us who have picked up a few actual cryptocurrency tokens.

Again, I don't expect Yellen and her top-level peers to consistently rule in favor of lower regulatory hurdles and less friction, but I do expect them to establish a reasonable balance between money laundering fears and privacy, between efficiency and safety, between financial stability and potential growth. In the long run, that's what's best for the cryptocurrency market as a whole and every player with an interest in it.











","Bitcoin (BTC) was lower, hovering around $32,000 for a fourth straight day.

A break above $35,000 could mark a “potential trend reversal, giving hope to the bulls,” the Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research told clients Tuesday in a report. “A break of the $30K support will probably see the price fall down to the $26K-$27K area.”

In traditional markets, European indexes were higher, bolstered by a flurry of corporate dealmaking announcements, despite a spreading coronavirus caseload, the prospect of stricter containment measures and rioting in the Netherlands.

U.S. stock futures fluctuated after congressional leaders said passage of President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion relief package might not happen until mid-March. Gold weakened 0.3% to $1,850 an ounce.

Funds for Harvard, Yale, Brown and the University of Michigan have quietly been buying cryptocurrency for the past year or so through accounts held at Coinbase, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported Monday, citing two sources familiar with the situation. Harvard has the largest university endowment of any with over $40 billion in assets, and Yale is close behind with more than $30 billion.

It’s a key development because digital-market analysts say growing interest from big institutional buyers has been a major factor in bitcoin’s quadrupling in price last year, with another 11% gain just in January alone.

While the university allocations likely represent a fraction of a percent of their total assets, the news reveals yet another potential source of demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at a time when corporations and money managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity have been lapping it up.

Based on the most recent data from the U.S. Education Department’s National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. university and college endowments had assets with a market value of about $600 billion as of 2017.

As First Mover has discussed previously, the corporate treasuries of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks represent a $2.3 trillion money pot of cash and short-term investments that could conceivably be at least partially allocated to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

And just since October when Square, the payments company helmed by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, announced it would put some $50 million, or 1% of its assets, into bitcoin, the number of corporate treasurers and fund managers following suit has expanded rapidly.

At that time, according to the handy website bitcointreasuries.org, there were just 60,927 BTC in corporate treasuries and professionally managed funds, valued at $619 million. The amount has since swelled to 1.22 million bitcoin valued at about $39.7 billion.

The developments keep coming:

Marathon Patent Group, a bitcoin mining company, disclosed Monday it bought $150 million of bitcoin for about $31,100 apiece during the cryptocurrency's recent rout. As reported by CoinDesk's Danny Nelson, the Nasdaq-listed firm said it bought the cache through the digital-asset manager NYDIG.

CoinShares, the digital-asset manager, reported Monday its weekly tally of inflows into cryptocurrency investment products hit a record $1.3 billion last week. The recent price weakness in bitcoin ""looks to have been a buying opportunity,"" according to the firm.

Rothschild Investment Corp., a Chicago-based money manager of $1.4 billion, disclosed Monday t had nearly $1 million of shares as of year-end 2020 in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), run by the CoinDesk sister company.

ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, an exchange-traded fund magnate and outspoken bitcoin advocate, said in a Jan. 23 interview with Yahoo Finance that large companies have asked her if they should invest in bitcoin as an inflation-hedging strategy. “I think we’re going to hear about more companies putting this hedge on their balance sheet,” she said.

And it’s apparently not just bitcoin these big players are after. As reported Monday by CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen, there are indications the recent rally in ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has been fueled in part by institutional buying.

Some of them are even dipping into the exotic, fast-growing and often risky arena of decentralized finance, known as DeFi – an interlocking array of semi-automated trading and lending platforms that entrepreneurs, coders and even hobbyists are assembling with blockchain technology and open-source software.

“The more adventurous institutions are exploring Ethereum and DeFi after they looked at bitcoin,” Arthur Cheong, founder and portfolio manager at DeFi-focused crypto fund DeFiance Capital, told Shen.

With the smartest money – literally – now buying cryptocurrencies, it’s hard to imagine more institutional players won’t follow. (We’re looking at you, pension funds with $4 trillion.)

“I’d imagine there are a few big names we don’t yet know of currently buying up bitcoin,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital asset for Swissquote Bank, as reported Monday by CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey. “We’ll likely discover them very soon, by which point they will have accumulated quite substantial volumes.”

Bitcoin options worth $4 billion are set to expire on Friday, potentially exacerbating price swings as January draws to a close.

Some 120,300 contracts are due for expiration on Friday on major exchanges Deribit, CME, Bakkt, OKEx, LedgerX, according to the data provider Skew.

Much of that amount can be found on Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange by trading volume: It’s on track for a record monthly bitcoin options expiry of 102,162 contracts (nearly $3.5 billion).

At current price levels, more than 80% of the options open interest would expire out-of-the-money, or worthless. But if the bitcoin market starts moving in the next few days, big players might be forced into new hedging transactions, which could give rise to more significant price turbulence.

“If BTC rapidly jumps to all-time highs within the next few days, it’s expected market makers will aggressively hedge their out-of-the-money short call option exposures, which would likely increase overall market volatility and momentum in the underlying price,” Samneet Chepal, quantitative analyst at the quantitative and systematic digital asset investment firm Ledger Prime, told CoinDesk.

Tweet of the day","The total weekly inflows in crypto-related investment products reached a record high of $1.31 billion last week after minor outflows in the previous weeks. Institutional investors still prefer Bitcoin over other digital assets as the world’s largest cryptocurrency accounted for 97% of the total weekly inflows.

According to a report published by CoinShares, Europe’s largest crypto asset management firm, the average daily trading volume of Bitcoin jumped significantly in 2021. So far this year, BTC has had an average trading volume of $12.3 billion per day, compared to just $2.2 billion in 2020.

Overall, Bitcoin accounts for 83% of the total digital assets under management, but the 97% weekly inflow into BTC shows that investors have more confidence in Bitcoin as compared to other crypto assets.

“Ethereum saw inflows of US $34m last week, although investors have been cautious, with little inflows since early December. Despite the record inflows, investment products have not tested the liquidity of the underlying Bitcoin, with investment products representing only 6.5% of total Bitcoin trading turnover,” the report states.

Bitcoin Price Action

The report by CoinShares mentioned that significant volatility in Bitcoin this year has made investors more price-conscious. BTC achieved an all-time high of $41,500 earlier this month after a record-breaking price rally. Bitcoin has lost nearly 25% of its value after registering a record-high and the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is now trading near $31,000. Additionally, Ethereum registered an all-time high of $1,470 yesterday after posting nearly 20% gains over the weekend.

“We believe investors have been very price-conscious this year due to the speed at which prices in Bitcoin achieved new highs. The recent price weakness, prompted by recent comments from Secretary of the US Treasury, Janet Yellen and the unfounded concerns of a double spend, now looks to have been a buying opportunity with inflows breaking all-time weekly inflows. So far this year, volumes in Bitcoin have been considerably higher, trading an average of US$12.3bn a day compared to US$2.2bn in 2020,” CoinShares mentioned in the report.","Why did this happen?

Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), announced today the unsealing of a Complaint in Manhattan federal court charging JEREMY SPENCE, a/k/a “Coin Signals,” a cryptocurrency trader who solicited funds for various cryptocurrency funds that he operated, with commodities fraud and wire fraud offenses. As alleged, SPENCE took cryptocurrency worth over $5 million from more than 170 individual investors after making false representations in connection with these cryptocurrency funds. SPENCE was arrested this morning in Rhode Island and will be presented later today before Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: “Jeremy Spence, a/k/a, ‘Coin Signals,’ allegedly lured investors to his cryptocurrency investment scam by touting returns of up to 148%. Spence’s investments not only failed to reach his audacious claims, they consistently lost money, leaving a $5 million void in his clients’ crypto accounts. Spence’s alleged conduct should strongly signal would-be investors to thoroughly educate themselves in the cryptocurrency ecosystem before falling prey to investment scams promising huge returns for small investments that are indeed too good to be true.”

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney said: “As alleged, Jeremy Spence misrepresented the success of his investment platform in order to entice people to send money his way. Because his trading was less than profitable and significantly less successful than he represented to investors, he used money from new investors to pay off others in order to keep his plan moving—a typical marker of a Ponzi scheme. Whether investing with cash, shares, or virtual currency, our advice to investors always remains the same—exercise due diligence, and when something just doesn’t seem right, report suspicious activity to the authorities.”

As alleged in the Complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:[1]

From November 2017 through April 2019, SPENCE solicited investors in various cryptocurrency investment pools that SPENCE had created and managed (the “Funds”). SPENCE solicited investments for several Funds, the largest and most active of which were the Coin Signals Bitmex Fund, a/k/a the “CS Mex Fund,” the Coin Signals Alternative Fund, a/k/a the “CS Alt Fund,” and the Coin Signals Long Term Fund. Investors who wanted to participate in a Fund would transfer cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to SPENCE in order for SPENCE to invest it.

SPENCE solicited these investments through false representations, including that SPENCE’s crypto trading had been extremely profitable when, in fact, SPENCE’s trading had been consistently unprofitable. For example, on January 28, 2018, SPENCE posted a message in an online chat group falsely claiming that his trading of investor funds over the past month had generated a return of more than 148%. As a result of this misrepresentation, investors transferred additional funds to SPENCE. In fact, over that same period of approximately one month, SPENCE’s trading resulted in net losses in the accounts in which he traded investor funds.

To forestall redemptions by investors, and to continue to raise money from investors to fund his scheme, SPENCE generated fictitious account balances, which he made available to investors online. Instead of accurately reporting the trading losses SPENCE was incurring, the account balances falsely indicated to investors that they were making money by investing with SPENCE. To hide his trading losses, SPENCE used new investor funds to pay back other investors in a Ponzi-like fashion. In total, SPENCE distributed cryptocurrency worth approximately $2 million to investors substantially from funds previously deposited by other investors.

SPENCE, 24, of Bristol, Rhode Island, is charged with one count of commodities fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge.

Ms. Strauss praised the investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and also thanked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its assistance.

The recent bull market has rekindled a long-simmering debate over whether the biggest such coin is, well, stable.

While bitcoin, ether and altcoins have seen astounding price rallies over the past four months, some of the most important growth has been in the cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins. These blockchain-based assets, usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, are a critical part of cryptocurrency trading activity and have taken in billions from investors who use them on exchanges around the world.

The biggest of them all, tether, has an eye-popping $25 billion market capitalization. However, tether’s critics charge its lack of transparency in everything from finances to the way its issuing company operates threatens the overall crypto market.

At issue is one of the most fundamental questions hanging over the cryptocurrency markets: Is the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inflated because the backing of tether may not be as strong as people think it is?

Why the market uses stablecoins

Despite hitting a $1 trillion market capitalization in January, freely floating cryptocurrencies, though more liquid than before, are still quite volatile. For example, for the past five years, bitcoin hasn’t been able to consistently maintain a 30-day volatility below 20% as gold does. This makes claims that bitcoin is “digital gold” a poor fit, which is where stablecoins come in.

Jeremy Allaire, chief executive officer of Circle, part of the CENTRE Consortium (with Coinbase) that manages USD coin (USDC), says cryptocurrency market traders need stablecoins to move quickly given constantly gyrating digital asset prices.

“If you’re active in the markets, you’re going to keep your money in a stablecoin because it’s radically faster, cheaper, better than the legacy banking system,” he told CoinDesk.

Allaire’s USDC is in many ways the sort of transparent enterprise stablecoins promise to be. A top 20 crypto asset, it has almost $5 billion in market capitalization and $2.7 billion in daily trading volume as of press time. Every month, the CENTRE Consortium publishes attestations from accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP to prove the amount of USDC in circulation matches up with the amount of dollars in a bank account, meaning the asset is fully backed by dollars. In accounting-speak, attestations are different from audits. Auditing is defined as an independent examination of data, whereas attestations evaluate and review how true data is.

Just a year ago, USDC’s market capitalization was merely $445 million. It saw a tenfold rise as the crypto markets skyrocketed amid uncertain times.

The tethered kingdom

While USDC is one of the more successful stablecoins, it’s relatively small compared to its most formidable and controversial competitor, one that is dominating the sector. The largest stablecoin – and the third largest cryptocurrency – in the entire digital asset ecosystem is tether (USDT).

In the past year, tether’s market capitalization has risen from $4.2 billion to a whopping $25 billion. In a span of four days in 2020, from March 31 to April 3, its market capitalization jumped by $2.1 billion alone.

“We’re not sure that anyone could have foreseen this level of growth and use cases of tether at the very beginning. We were confident that it was a useful token, but didn’t anticipate quite how useful it could be,” Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer of Tether and the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, told CoinDesk

So far in January alone, Tether has plowed $3.8 billion more USDT into the crypto ecosystem.

Tether’s entanglements

It is true that Tether is likely an original. It is a project that started as Realcoin, founded in 2014 by entrepreneurs Brock Pierce, Craig Sellars and Reeve Collins. Nonetheless, many in the industry – and law enforcement – have questioned its legitimacy. Multiple ongoing investigations, including from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the New York Attorney General’s office, have dogged the stablecoin company. At the center of the DOJ’s criminal investigation into Tether as an organization is whether or not USDT is used to inflate the cryptocurrency markets.

Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner provided this statement to CoinDesk regarding the U.S. investigations: “We work with regulators and law enforcement agencies around the world to help their investigations and help them understand our business. We always want to support law enforcement’s legitimate objectives. With respect to the New York Attorney General’s special proceeding, we believe that our discussions with their office has been constructive and we look forward to continuing the conversation.”

Like USDC, USDT is closely associated with an exchange; USDC is used on Coinbase’s exchange and USDT is utilized on Bitfinex, although both are also used on other exchanges. But the behavior of the two assets on the two exchanges is quite different, according to data analytics firm CryptoQuant.

“Compared to bitcoin, there’s no multiple stablecoin addresses for exchanges,” Ki Young Ju, chief executive officer of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. Because of this, Ki’s firm has been able to use data from exchanges to calculate what it calls a “stablecoin ratio.” The calculation is the bitcoin reserves from known hot wallets in U.S. dollar (USD) terms divided by the stablecoin reserve addresses exchanges. The higher the ratio, the higher the selling pressure.

“The ratio for stablecoins like USDC is like 18%-25%,” depending on the exchange, said Young Ju. “But tether is just 7%, meaning most of the demand didn’t come from exchanges.”

So where is the demand coming from? While USDT does have a transparency page on its website showing assets and liabilities, it does not appear to provide a regular attestation from any third party that the amount of USDT in circulation matches a bank account somewhere.

Tether’s backing questioned

John Griffin, a professor at the University of Texas, wrote with Amin Shams, a former student who is now a professor in the Department of Finance at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, the academic peer-reviewed paper “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?”

The 2018 paper said one entity, demarcated in the paper with a single bitcoin address, exerted a remarkable amount of control over the bitcoin bull market in 2017 by minting tether that was then used to buy bitcoin. “We find that one large player is associated with more than half of the exchange of tether for bitcoin at Bitfinex, suggesting that the distribution of tether into the market is from a large player and not many different investors bringing cash to Bitfinex to purchase tether,” according to the research.

The report added that very little tether is returned to the issuer to be redeemed, suggesting the crypto market is at least somewhat inflated by the USDT used by that address to buy bitcoin during the 2017 bull market time period.

Bitfinex/Tether did not respond to specific inquiries regarding the paper, which was updated in 2019. However, in a blog post they slammed the study.

“We have now reviewed the updated Tether article by John M. Griffin and Amin Shams,” begins a Bitfinex blog post from Nov. 7, 2019. “The purported conclusions reached by the authors are built on a house of cards that suffers from the absence of a complete dataset.”

In response, Griffin and Shams disputed that a complete dataset wasn’t used and said blockchain data is easier to obtain for analysis than most realize. They also said it took them a long time to parse and verify all the data to come to the conclusions they did for peer review and publishing.

“One of the things that our paper found is that tether was being printed unbacked and being used to push up cryptocurrency,” Griffin told CoinDesk. “At the time that we printed our paper Tether rigorously denied that.”

However, Hoegner, Bitfinex’s general counsel and who also represents Tether, conceded in an affidavit filed in a case brought by the New York Attorney General that at least as of April 2019, Tether assets circulating in the crypto ecosystem were only 74% backed by cash and cash equivalents. The case alleges Bitfinex lost $850 million and subsequently used funds from Tether to secretly cover the shortfall.

When asked by CoinDesk to provide specific information regarding redemptions and issuances, Bitfinex’s Ardoino gave this answer: “Much of the information for which you’re looking is available on public blockchains. The data shows that demand for redemptions is far surpassed by the demand for issuances.”

In 2018, the DOJ’s Criminal Division awarded Griffin’s forensic data analysis firm, Integra FEC, $400,000 for “Tether Investigation,” according to a previous version of the contract’s webpage. On Dec. 27, 2020, the contract was updated to reflect completion before the end of 2021, although there is no longer any reference to Tether on the site.

Shams, Griffin’s collaborator on the paper, doesn’t have any involvement with Integra FEC and told CoinDesk he has not taken any money for his research. He says the paper was well-received in the academic community but believes, like Griffin, that it should be taken more seriously in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, especially given the rigorous peer-review process.

Shams noted the paper was published in the Journal of Finance, which according to statistics on its official website, has accepted only 4.38% of submissions since 2016. “It’s by far the best finance journal,” he said.

Tether’s surprising defender

An unlikely defender of tether is CEO Allaire. He is one example of a longtime participant in the cryptocurrency community who isn’t convinced tether has undue influence on the crypto market.

“I think what I can say is the academic theory that they have run a giant fraud to create tether out of thin air, to buy bitcoin, to drive up prices, I think that’s complete BS,” Allaire told CoinDesk. “If you want to deploy capital into the markets, you do it through stablecoins and then you go bring those dollars into the markets and you buy things and trade things.”

“In particular in Asia where, you know, these are dollar-denominated markets, they have to use a shadow banking system to do it,” Allaire said. “You can’t connect a bank account in China to Binance or Huobi. So you have to do it through shadow banking and they do it through tether. And so it just represents the aggregate demand. Investors and users in Asia – it’s a huge, huge piece of it.”

When Allaire refers to “shadow banking” he’s talking about a term created back in 2007 by an economist to refer to unregulated or lightly regulated non-bank financial institutions. The problem is, shadow banks are not backed by typical FDIC insurance to protect deposits in the U.S. Also, shadow banks were singled out as nefarious participants in the 2008 financial crisis.

When asked about how Tether helps those without proper banking, Ardoino says the liquidity component of USDT is key to the crypto exchange ecosystem. “Tether allows for a more efficient experience across exchange platforms and in digital token commerce more generally,” Ardoino said. “Tether realized early on the importance of a common asset in the crypto ecosystem that can be used seamlessly across multiple blockchains and communities to access and provide liquidity.”

However, Griffin compares problems with tether to traditional financial markets and highlights a gap the stablecoin still has to bridge.

“Having a stablecoin and using stablecoins in the space is a good idea, but you need to have a stablecoin that undergoes proper auditing and proper monitoring,” Griffin told CoinDesk. “It would be equivalent to saying, ‘Hey, let’s make an [exchange-traded fund] in the U.S. on the Russian ruble,’ and then you got the North Koreans and [Russian President] Putin manipulating the ruble,” he said. “And then you wonder, like, well, ‘I wonder why the ruble went up so much this weekend?’”

‘A partial-reserve stablecoin’

Kevin Lehtiniitty is the chief strategy officer of Prime Trust, a Nevada-based trust company that has worked extensively with stablecoins. The firm, as a financial institution, has developed a “stablecoin as a service” product for the crypto market, providing custody, payments and instructing of the minting and burning of stable tokens for exchange.

“We were the first financial institution to be a stablecoin as a service provider,” Lehtiniitty told CoinDesk. “Basically the exchange is a technology layer on top of the stablecoin.”

Prime Trust has worked with over 38 stablecoin products, the first being the venture capital-backed TrueUSD in 2018. “Now, obviously, 38 stablecoins are not going to win,” said Lehtiniitty. “It’s going to be kind of like a winner or top two or three take all kind of a market.”

Lehtiniitty did not mince words on his thoughts about stablecoins without transparent asset backing, calling tether a “partial reserve stablecoin.” “I think the general market sentiment, at least from our perspective, is that people know that – people just don’t think it’s going to crash when they are doing what they are doing.”

“What are the odds that it’s going to crash in the next few hours that I’m holding?” Lehtiniitty continued. ”And that’s what is the world’s dumbest excuse. But I hear it time and time again from OTC and trading partners, other folks, and it drives me nuts.”

Yet, it likely would take a loss of tether’s peg to the dollar for anyone to even raise any alarm because market forces appear to be keeping prices in line, according to another paper, funded by Ripple, called “What Keeps Stablecoins Stable?” by Richard K. Lyons of University of California, Berkeley and Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj University of Warwick.

That paper argues that traders are helping stabilize prices around the peg. And while tether’s peg to the U.S. dollar hasn’t dipped in quite some time, it has happened before, the paper points out.

USDT’s deviations from the peg. Source: “What Keeps Stablecoins Stable?”

“A lot of very well capitalized people believe that tether is better off existing than not,” Lehtiniitty said. He pointed to the May 2019 $1 billion LEO token offering Bitfinex conducted as an example. “They were willing to put their money where their mouth was to the tune of a tremendous amount of capital to keep tether propped up,” Lehtiniitty added.

Regulators making moves

In the U.S., the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) has said this month that federally regulated banks can use stablecoins for payments and other services. Also this month, the U.K. released a paper and request for commentary on the use of stablecoins in finance.

All of this, Lehtiniitty suspects, is to build a framework around stablecoins backed by banking in an effort to weed out possible systemic risks that partial-reserve stablecoins like tether may cause should a peg break.

“The only way tether kind of stops and we then go to fully backed stablecoins is regulatory pressure. And what I mean by that is basically saying banks can deal with fully reserved stablecoins, not with other types of stablecoins,” he said.

In a recent video interview, Gregory Pepin, the deputy CEO of Tether’s bank, Deltec, said, “Every tether is backed by a reserve and their reserve is more than what is in circulation.”

More trouble for Tether as an organization looms on the horizon. A federal criminal trial involving real estate investor Reggie Fowler, who was involved in allegedly providing Tether and Bitfinex with shadow banking at one point, is underway in New York. In the case brought by that state’s attorney general, key documents were supposed to be provided by Bitfinex and Tether by Jan. 15. And the DOJ’s Criminal Division investigation is ongoing with Integra’s contract running until the end of 2021.","A novel cryptocurrency fund run by digital assets-focused investment manager Wave Financial, which uses a call options strategy to trade on bitcoin’s volatility, has scored a near-146 per cent return in its first year of trading.

The Wave BTC Income & Growth Digital Fund, a pioneering cryptocurrency derivatives-based strategy, aims to capitalise on bitcoin’s high volatility using a covered call approach to generate returns, while also capturing the potential upside of the currency.

The fund – whose investor base comprises a mix of institutions, family offices and high-net worth individuals with experience in both digital assets and traditional financial market – notched up a 145.8 per cent annual gain in first full year of operation.

Benjamin Tsai, president of Los Angeles-based Wave, said the strategy achieved a stable return in what is still considered a particularly volatile asset class.

“The income component is particularly compelling in the current low yield environment,” Tsai noted.

Matteo Dante Perruccio, president international at Wave, added: “WBIG is a fund that is specifically designed to provide investors with significant exposure to bitcoin, whilst offsetting volatility from such exposure and with the aim of generating a stable return. WBIG strives to smooth out the volatile bitcoin return profile by converting that volatility into high yield.”

Wave Financial is the digital assets unit of London- and Los Angeles-based Wave Financial Group, the parent company set up in 2018 by CEO David Siemer, a venture capital, private equity and hedge fund specialist focused on digital assets, and Tsai, former managing director of structured products at Merrill Lynch in Asia.

Wave Financial, which brings together a team of investment managers with expertise in asset management and investment banking in the US and Europe, offers a range of investable funds to private and institutional investors focused on digital assets and tokenised real assets.","Crypto exchange platform Bitstamp is reportedly demanding additional Know Your Customer compliance steps for Dutch-based users.

According to a notice sent to Twitter user “Bitcoin Marcus,” — a Bitstamp user — the platform says account holders in the Netherlands have until the end of January to provide additional verification documents or risk their accounts being suspended.

Today @Bitstamp has gone even further than the law requires. They now want me to:

- show them how much I earn

- show them where I got my #bitcoin from

- proof of funds



Seriously!! WTF!! And I can’t withdraw and leave so must comply.. pic.twitter.com/ze4ixNJJyd — Bitcoin Marcus ☣️⚡️ (@plan_marcus) January 25, 2021

As part of the additional KYC protocols, users must provide information about their net worth, nationality and proof of residence. Other documents demanded by Bitstamp include the source of funds — both for fiat and crypto.

Indeed, the exchange is reportedly forcing Dutch-based customers to reveal sensitive personal information like their salaries and investment proceeds.

These KYC steps are in addition to an earlier order mandating users to whitelist their third-party withdrawal addresses by providing photographic proof of ownership of those wallets.

Responding to Bitcoin Marcus’s complaints on Twitter, Bitstamp remarked, “Unfortunately, this procedure is required for our users from the Netherlands due to new regulation regarding cryptocurrencies introduced by the Dutch government.”

For Bitcoin Marcus, however, Bitstamp is bending over backward to satisfy Dutch authorities, especially the central bank, adding that only exchanges headquartered in the Netherlands require these additional KYC compliance steps.

Commenting on customer complaints regarding the KYC policies, Bitstamp chief technology officer David Osojnik told Cointelegraph:

""The solution we’ve implemented for verifying crypto withdrawal addresses is extremely straightforward and as unobtrusive as possible, while still satisfying the requirements set by the Dutch authorities. We do, however, realize that this situation may inconvenience our customers and encourage you to contact your local representatives or the DNB regarding the matter.""

Dutch authorities issued new requirements for crypto exchanges back in 2019 with the measures coming into effect in November 2020. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitonic, a crypto exchange in the Netherlands, described the new measures as “a nuisance.”

Requiring users to hand over personal and financial information may also pose a security risk. Centralized databases holding such sensitive data are usually a target for cybercriminals.

Exchanges and other crypto businesses have fallen victim to malicious cyber-incursions exposing user data. Hardware wallet maker Ledger is a prime example with almost 300,000 users having their details compromised by hackers.","Why did this happen?

Bitcoin is officially in a bear market, having fallen roughly 28% from all-time highs reached earlier this month. Falling this far has logically impacted cryptocurrency stocks, including those companies holding bitcoin, mining bitcoin, and providing mining equipment. Here are some movers today as of 2:30 p.m. EST:

Shares of MicroStrategy NASDAQ:MSTR)

Shares of Riot Blockchain NASDAQ:RIOT)

Shares of Bit Digital NASDAQ:BTBT)

Shares of Hut 8 Mining OTC:HUTM.F)

Shares of Marathon Patent Group NASDAQ:MARA)

Shares of Canaan NASDAQ:CAN)

While the price of bitcoin is having its effect, it's possible some of these stocks are being indirectly impacted by the GameStop short squeeze.

So what

Before we talk about the GameStop effect, let's handle MicroStrategy's special case. This company's stock price is more tied to the price of bitcoin than are the other cryptocurrency stocks here. That's because it holds 70,784 bitcoin tokens on its balance sheet, worth more than $2.1 billion at the current price of $30,000 per token. As a mid-cap company, this means an outsize portion of MicroStrategy's value is directly derived from the current market price of bitcoin. As the cryptocurrency goes up and down day by day, so too will MicroStrategy stock.

MicroStrategy holds this much bitcoin because of its new corporate policy. All excess cash is to be held on the balance sheet in bitcoin. It's a policy CEO Michael Saylor hopes more companies will institute. Therefore, the company is holding a conference called Bitcoin for Corporations on Feb. 3, where Saylor will explain what companies need to consider before instituting a similar policy. But Marathon Patent Group apparently doesn't need any convincing at a conference; it's already doing what MicroStrategy does.

On Jan. 25, Marathon announced it used $150 million to buy 4,812.66 bitcoin tokens. As a bitcoin mining company, it was already subject to the volatility in its price. But now the stock's value will be even more closely tied to the popular cryptocurrency. Like MicroStrategy, expect Marathon stock to closely track bitcoin's movements.

This reality addressed, I believe there's a GameStop effect in play for Marathon, Riot Blockchain, Bit Digital, Hut 8 Mining, and Canaan today. These stocks have all surged in recent months on extreme trading volume. Traders piled into these former penny stocks hoping for quick gains -- and boy, they got 'em!

The thing with short-term traders is just that: They don't stick around long term. As long as they believe there's money to be made (like when the price of bitcoin is rising), then they'll pile in footloose and fancy-free. But as soon as hotter trades present themselves, they'll cash out and move on. And considering that highly shorted stocks like GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings, and Express are currently surging more than 100% and 200% in a single day, hotter trades are here, folks.

This theory is just a guess on my part, but an educated guess nonetheless. For evidence, consider the trading volumes of these stocks. For example, the average trading volume for Riot Blockchain stock over the last three months is over 26 million shares, according to Yahoo! Finance. Today, it's just 10.6 million so far. Or how about Bit Digital? Its three-month average is almost 7 million shares. Today, it's just 1.6 million.

That's still a lot of volume, but it's falling fast. To me, this indicates that cryptocurrency stocks have lost a little bit of their appeal with traders. And we all know what comes after the pump.

Now what

Investing in cryptocurrency stocks is no different than investing in any other stock. When you find a growing company serving a large and growing addressable market with great profit potential, those are good candidates to beat the market over long periods of time. Buying those stocks at reasonable valuations can make the investments even better.

Over the long term, I would expect bitcoin mining companies to struggle to create shareholder value. Revenue-growth potential does increase when the price of bitcoin goes up. But higher bitcoin prices usually mean increased competition, requiring these companies to spend big to amp up their computing power. And manufacturers of bitcoin mining equipment like Canaan also struggle, since sales tend to be cyclical.

As always, try not to be motivated by the highs and lows in the short term. Keep your eyes at least three to five years down the road to improve your investing decisions.","Anthony Pompliano, the popular crypto evangelist and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, is launching a blockchain-focused jobs board, with backing from Gemini, Coinbase and BlockFi.

Announced Wednesday, PompCryptoJobs went live with over 100 open crypto positions advertised by its three launch partners.

Pompliano – known simply as “Pomp” in the crypto world – is planning to leverage his large audience to bring companies and job candidates together in a talent marketplace. (Back in August 2020, Pompliano’s Morgan Creek Digital led a $50 million investment round in crypto lender BlockFi.)

“I think that there is an obvious need in the market right now,” Pomp said in an interview. “You’ve got millions of Americans and people around the world that are out of work, and millions more who want to transition from their existing job. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency companies are growing and hiring very fast, but there’s no single place where the job candidates and the employers can meet each other.”

The crypto industry, composed of armies of machine coders and social media scrum-halfs, does indeed seem to be booming. This month, Digital Currency Group (the owner of CoinDesk and four other firms in the space) posted over 60 new job vacancies.

The revenue model for the new crypto jobs portal involves paying a monthly fee to list positions, Pomp explained.","For many investors, much of the past year has been a roller-coaster ride. But for cryptocurrency investors in bitcoin, it's been a fun one.

Over the trailing year, through Jan. 23, bitcoin rose by a cool 280% -- a return that's nearly 17 times greater than what the benchmark S&P 500 delivered over the same period. Crypto enthusiasts continue to be enamored with the perceived scarcity of bitcoin (only 21 million tokens will be mined), its growing utility with merchants, and the game-changing potential that its blockchain offers to expedite the settlement of payments, especially overseas.

But many of these catalysts are actually fundamental flaws for bitcoin. For instance, its token count is only limited by community consensus and not anything truly tangible. What's more, only 2,300 businesses in the U.S. accept bitcoin as a form of payment, according to Fundera. That's out of 7.7 million businesses with at least one employee.

Rather than buying into what I view as the most dangerous investment of 2021, investors should consider putting their money to work in the following three unstoppable stocks. All of these companies offer innovation and tangible growth potential that can crush bitcoin in 2021 (and probably well beyond).

Square

If the digital payments revolution excites you, fintech stock Square (NYSE:SQ) is where you'll want to put your money to work. Square is one of the prime beneficiaries of the coronavirus crisis, but this company was rapidly growing well before the pandemic hit.

Square's most mature operating segment is its seller ecosystem. This is what provides point-of-sale solutions and analytic tools to businesses to help them grow. Prior to 2020, this ecosystem saw the amount of gross payment volume (GPV) traversing its networks grow by an average of 49% annually to $106.2 billion. Merchant fees drive this operating segment, meaning more GPV will yield higher revenue and improved gross profit.

What's interesting about this foundational growth piece for Square is that it's no longer just for small businesses. By the end of September 2020, 61% of all GPV in the seller ecosystem came from companies with an annualized GPV of at least $125,000. By Square's definition, that's a medium or large business. If Square is able to continue attracting bigger merchants onto its platform, the seller ecosystem can sustain double-digit growth.

The even faster-growing segment for Square is peer-to-peer payment platform Cash App. In 2.5 years, Cash App's monthly active user count more than quadrupled to 30 million. Further, Cash App downloads have been regularly outpacing PayPal's Venmo.

The beauty of Cash App is that it engages the next generation of banking customers (millennials and Generation Z) while giving Square many ways to generate revenue. Aside from merchant fees, Cash App can generate sales from bank transfers, investments, and yes... even bitcoin exchange. No matter what happens to bitcoin, Square is getting richer because of trading surrounding the world's largest cryptocurrency.

Lovesac

If small-cap stocks are more your thing, modular furniture designer and retailer Lovesac (NASDAQ:LOVE) is the company for you. That's right, a furniture company is going to outpace the mighty bitcoin in 2021.

The first thing to realize about Lovesac is that it isn't your run-of-the-mill furniture company. It primarily sells sactionals -- modular couches that can be rearranged a multitude of ways to fit a consumer's livable space -- and sacs, which are beanbag chairs. Around 81% of net sales are derived from sactionals.

There are over 250 different machine-washable covers for sactionals that can be ordered to match customers' needs. Additionally, the yarn used in the sactional covers is made from recycled plastic water bottles. If eco-conscious investing is in your blood, you're going to love this company.

There's more to like about Lovesac than the choices it provides its customers and its eco-friendly operations. For example, Lovesac runs a considerably lower overhead operating model than many of its peers. Aside from pop-up showrooms, the company has leaned heavily on direct-to-consumer sales during the pandemic. Without the cost of having hundreds of physical showrooms, Lovesac's low overhead translates into higher operating margins.

Navigating its way through the worst economic recession in decades, Lovesac is likely to have delivered a full-year profit in 2020. That's two years ahead of when Wall Street expected the company to turn the corner to recurring profitability. Relative to its rapid sales growth and innovation, Lovesac is still cheap.

Cresco Labs

Another high-growth industry with tangible potential that can crush bitcoin in 2021 is cannabis. Specifically, U.S. multistate operator (MSO) Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF) has all the tools needed to deliver the green to investors.

Marijuana investors are excited about the fact that Democrats control the White House and Congress, which means the prospect of passing federal cannabis reforms is now greater than ever. However, Cresco Labs doesn't need anything to happen at the federal level for its business to thrive.

Like most MSOs, Cresco Labs has established a retail presence. It currently has 20 open dispensaries, 10 of which are located in Illinois. The Land of Lincoln, which opened its doors to adult-use weed sales on Jan. 1, 2020, is a limited license state. This means it's only going to issue a certain of number of retail licenses. With Cresco maximizing its presence in this potential billion-dollar market (a maximum of 10 stores), it should be assured of significant share.

But unlike most MSOs, the most exciting aspect of Cresco's operations has to do with its wholesale segment. Since retail typically leads to higher margins than wholesale, most pot stocks tend to prefer the retail route. Thankfully, Cresco Labs has a trick up its sleeve.

In January 2020, Cresco acquired Origin House, which is one of only a handful of companies that held a cannabis distribution license in California -- the largest marijuana market in the world by annual sales. With this license in hand, Cresco was able to place pot products into more than 575 dispensaries throughout the state. Even if wholesale is a lower-margin venture, Cresco has more than enough volume in the Golden State to make it worthwhile.

Look for Cresco Labs to blaze past bitcoin in 2021.","S&P Global: Cryptocurrencies Have Become Mainstream and Are Here to Stay, Bitcoin Reminiscent of Gold Rush

S&P Global says cryptocurrencies have become mainstream and appear to be here to stay, as more companies are offering crypto services and adoption is growing worldwide. Meanwhile, an S&P analyst believes that bitcoin’s rise is reminiscent of the U.S. gold rush.

S&P Global Says Bitcoin Has Become Mainstream

Financial information and analytics firm S&P Global released a special report on the current condition of cryptocurrencies last week. It states:

Once considered an alternative trend, cryptocurrencies have become mainstream and appear here to stay.

The report references a number of factors, such as legacy banks taking “a closer look at the asset class that could be integrated into the products and services offering” and companies like Paypal beginning to offer cryptocurrency services. Crypto adoption is also growing in countries where people “seek to protect their income against inflation and currency controls” or for faster and cheaper remittances.

In addition, Jim Wiederhold, S&P Global’s associate director for commodities and real assets, authored an opinion piece about bitcoin last week. He wrote:

The recent enthusiasm for bitcoin is reminiscent of the Gold Rush in the western U.S. from 1848-1860 … U.S. enthusiasm for gold exploded over this time period.

The analyst explained that “Recently, the parallels between the two assets have grown.” He noted that both are scarce, “have the potential to be held outside of conventional financial markets,” and are good inflation hedges. In addition, they are “uncorrelated to other popular asset classes in portfolios.” However, he pointed out that bitcoin’s volatility over the past five years is multiple times higher than other asset classes.

Pointing out the differences between gold and bitcoin, including the supply limit, he continued, “Concerns of bitcoin theft were rampant a few years ago; though as bitcoin becomes more mainstream, these worries are fading. Although lingering technology and exchange counterparty risks remain.”

The analyst concluded that while gold is a more established asset, bitcoin “is in its infancy, but it is slowly becoming more easily accessible to mainstream investors.”

According to the S&P Global special report:

Cryptocurrency may appear to be a niche or experimental segment for these companies, but industry experts say they are treating it with increasing seriousness.

Odds are you have a savings account with your bank and you’re probably earning an abysmal interest rate on that money. Most savings accounts in 2021 offer less than 0.5% annual interest to their clients.

But, what if you could be earning an annual percentage yield (APY) that’s 10 or 20 times more than your current interest rate with your bank? Cryptocurrency makes this possible through smart contracts, and you don’t even need to be exposed to risky assets like Bitcoin to do so.

Cryptocurrency Loans Explained

Cryptocurrency loans operate similarly to a loan you would get at a bank. The bank receives funds from your savings account, which it then lends to borrowers. The bank offers you interest on your savings account and then charges borrowers a higher interest to earn a profit.

Two blockchain-related technologies make these phenomenal interest rates secure and risk-averse. First, smart contracts guarantee crypto loans are paid back, even without vetting the borrower’s credit. Smart contracts are codes on the blockchain that can perform certain functions, such as holding loan collateral in an escrow account.

Second, stablecoins allow you to earn great interest rates without being exposed to the high volatility of Bitcoin. Stablecoins, such as USDC, DAI and Tether, are cryptocurrencies always equal to $1. These cryptocurrencies are able to maintain a stable value through USD reserves, arbitrage and complex code backed by cryptocurrencies.

There are 2 distinct types of cryptocurrency lending platforms on the market today: centralized lending platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

Centralized Crypto Lending Platforms

Centralized cryptocurrency lending platforms operate most similarly to banks. Platforms like BlockFi allow you to earn interest on your cryptocurrency by storing your funds on its platform. BlockFi then lends your money to trusted institutional and corporate buyers.

The interest rate you earn is a floating interest rate, meaning that it changes with supply and demand. Over the past year, however, the APY for stablecoins on cryptocurrency lending platforms has remained relatively stable around 6% to 12%.

The cryptocurrency you chose to fund your account affects the interest rate you earn. For example, you can earn a 6% interest rate on Bitcoin, but if you choose to fund your account with USDT (a stablecoin) you can earn 9.3% annually.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platforms

DeFi is a new industry that has recently gained popularity among cryptocurrency investors. DeFi uses smart contracts to replace centralized 3rd parties in transactions. Instead of having a bank manage loans, for example, DeFi uses escrow accounts and code to manage money autonomously.

Smart contracts are essentially just contracts on the blockchain. As this code is uploaded to a blockchain (typically Ethereum, as Bitcoin doesn’t support smart contracts), it’s able to hold cryptocurrencies in escrow until specified functions are undergone.

For example, smart contracts can allow you to take out a loan without credit. If you want to take out a loan for a cryptocurrency, all you need to do is add collateral to the smart contract and then choose which crypto you want your loan in.

So what’s the point in taking out a loan if you need to put up collateral? For most retail users the answer is leverage. If you put up collateral in a cryptocurrency and receive a loan in cryptocurrency, you’re essentially doubling your leverage. If you pay back your loan, you will profit from the appreciation of the crypto you borrowed and the crypto you put up as collateral.

Best for Beginners: BlockFi

Interest rate: 3% to 9.3% APY

BlockFi is a great place to start earning money from a high-interest savings account. You can fund your savings account with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin or stablecoins.

If you decide to fund your wallet with Bitcoin, you will earn a 6% APY on the first 2.5 BTC (about $87,000) and 3% APY on any amount of Bitcoin over 2.5. Ethereum and Litecoin both offer around 5% APY, while stablecoins offer 8% to 9% annual interest rates.

You can withdraw your crypto at any time with BlockFi. It offers 1 free withdrawal per month and charges a small fee for any extra withdrawals.

BlockFi also offers its users USD loans. To be lent money, you must put up cryptocurrency as collateral –– The amount of collateral you put up affects your loan rate, which ranges from 4.5% to 9.75%. There’s no maximum loan amount (the amount of the loan is limited by your collateral).

Best for Crypto Variety: Celsius

Interest rate: 3.2% to 21.49%

Celsius has been operating since 2018 and has processed $8.2 billion in loans among its 340,000 users. Celsius has passed an asset verification from a trusted auditor, Chainalysis, so you can invest worry-free.

Celsius offers a plethora of cryptocurrencies to fund your savings account with. Celsius and BlockFi offer similar APY for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but Celsius offers a more competitive APY for stablecoins. Celsius offers a staggering 13.86% APY for tether, USDC, GUSD and TUSD, which are all stablecoins.

Similar to BlockFi, Celsius also offers loans to its users with a minimum loan of $500. There is no maximum loan you can take out, but you need to put up a proportional amount of crypto to receive the loan.

If you’re constantly on the go, Celsius offers a great mobile app to manage your finances from anywhere. Both its PC and mobile user interfaces are simplistic and easy to use.

Best for DeFi Loans: yearn.finance

Interest rate: 1.3% to 18.65%

The yearn.finance protocol is a decentralized way to earn interest on your cryptocurrency. Instead of a trusted 3rd party like BlockFi or Celsius, yearn operates on smart contracts.

Yearn offers a suite of products in the decentralized finance industry. Its 2 most popular products are yearn vaults and yEarn. Yearn vaults pool users’ money into a smart contract that searches for the highest yield opportunities in the market. The contract autonomously allocates capital based on the opportunities present in the market.

yEarn, a lending aggregator, automatically allocates capital to different lending platforms based on the interest rate offered. The lenders which yearn.finance allocates funds to are Aave, Compound and dYdX.

Yearn token (YFI) is the governance token that allows YFI holders to vote on upgrades to the smart contracts. Since yearn token’s release, YFI has appreciated over 4,000%, and each YFI token is currently trading at around $34,000.

Much like the centralized exchanges above, yearn.finance offers no-maximum loans based on collateral. Also, the interest you earn on your crypto is highly variant based on the cryptocurrency you fund the protocol with (TUSD offers the highest stablecoin yield at 14.5% APY).

Best for Mobile Users: Argent Wallet

Interest rate: 1% to 24% APY

Argent is probably the best DeFi wallet around. What’s unique about argent’s wallet is that you can directly interact with several lending protocols to earn the most competitive APY. Argent currently supports protocols such as Aave, Compound and yearn.

Argent is a great choice if you’re looking to hold your cryptocurrency in a crypto wallet that allows you to earn interest. There are a few drawbacks to argent when comparing it to centralized crypto loans, however.

First, argent is an Ethereum wallet. This means that you are only able to deposit Ethereum and Ethereum-based tokens (such as Tether, yearn and USDC). If you’re looking to earn interest on Bitcoin, there are ways to use Bitcoin on Ethereum’s blockchain by using Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

Second, argent doesn’t offer its users loans. If you’re looking to get a loan using your cryptocurrency as collateral, you should consider using BlockFi or Celsius.

Is Crypto Lending Safe?

The biggest risk when lending cryptocurrency is the chance of the asset you loan decreasing in value. If you are particularly risk-averse, you should consider only earning interest on stablecoins.

There is also the risk of a security breach –– albeit, extremely low. Centralized lending platforms use state-of-the-art encryption that is comparable to online banking standards. With DeFi protocols, however, there is a chance of the smart contracts being hacked. This being said, these smart contracts are relatively simple, so there aren’t likely to be any coding errors.

Most large DeFi platforms have several millions of dollars locked in their smart contracts. If a hacker were able to breach the smart contract, they would get access to all of the funds in the smart contract. Being that the code hasn’t been hacked with this large of a bounty, it’s clear that big DeFi protocols don’t have a high risk of being hacked.

Could Blockchain be the Future of Loans?

Yes, it could be. Cryptocurrency could be the future of money — making blockchain the future of loans. Although these projects have had billions of dollars locked into their protocols, they have a long way to go before taking over the multi-trillion-dollar debt industry.

Right now most crypto loans are consumer-oriented. For crypto loans to truly become mainstream, developers need to create a better system of credit on the blockchain –– this will allow more users to receive loans and increase the utility of borrowing money through the blockchain.","How much is bitcoin worth? Should you invest in it? If so, how do you invest in bitcoin? Great questions. And since its creation in 2009, bitcoin investing has intrigued, excited and, often, frightened market-watchers and investors alike. Notoriously volatile, the cryptocurrency traded at 8 cents per coin in 2010, to an all-time high of more than US$23,000 on Dec. 16, 2020. If you were to chart bitcoin’s worth in the intervening years, it would look like the profile of a terrifying roller coaster, with a long, slow, initial rise, followed by jagged peaks and valleys from 2017—the first time it crested US$20,000—to today.

There are other crypto investments, but bitcoin is considered the most widely traded and most successful. It has been mused that if you invested $1,000 in bitcoin at 8 cents per coin in 2010, your cryptocurrency investment would be worth $287.5 million today. Phew! No wonder bitcoin has captured so much interest.

What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a digital currency that many call the best cryptocurrency to buy, dubbing it “the new gold.” Of course, gold is one of the oldest currencies on earth, and currencies and methods of payment are always evolving.

What does this mean? Arthur Salzer of Northland Wealth Management offers: “Monetary value usually arises from objects that are scarce, durable and relatively easy to divide. Since the dawn of civilization, societies have used rare seashells, wampum, glass beads, and stones as money or a form of record keeping. Gold is an ideal example since it can be made into jewelry, coins and bars, but bitcoin is unique in today’s digital world since it is scarce, durable, has strong privacy characteristics.”

These days, gold is rarely used as a form of payment; it’s seen more as a store of value, and an investment or portfolio asset that is not highly correlated to stocks and bonds and cash.

Similarly, supporters and owners of cryptocurrency invest in bitcoin because they see it as a store of value, and a useful portfolio asset. Bitcoin may also work its way into a direct method of payment as well. In other words, you might one day use bitcoin to buy a car or a loaf of bread. It’s a lot quicker and easier to send digital money than to lug around bars of gold.

How to invest in cryptocurency

Bitcoin isn’t your typical investment. In fact, as a digital currency, bitcoin is not a physical coin. Rather, a bitcoin is created and then accessed by way of a digital code. This happens over the internet.

The ledger (blockchain) where the transactions are executed and monitored is public and for all to see. That’s referred to as “open source.”","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Losses from cryptocurrency theft, hacks, and fraud fell 57% last year to $1.9 billion, as market participants boosted security systems, but crime in the ‘decentralized finance’ space continued to grow, a report from crypto intelligence company CipherTrace showed.

FILE PHOTO: A representation of virtual currency Bitcoin and small toy figures are placed on computer motherboard in this illustration taken January 7, 2021. Picture is taken January 7, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic

Criminals got away with a record $4.5 billion in 2019 in the crypto market.

Fraud was the dominant cryptocurrency crime in 2020, followed by theft, and ransomware. Half of all thefts, or about $129 million, were hacks tied to decentralized finance (DeFi), which are transactions on platforms that facilitate lending outside of banks.

Cryptocurrencies have attracted renewed scrutiny and interest as institutional investors have piled into digital assets, particularly bitcoin, propelling the latter to a record high of $42,000 this month.

“Thefts from hacks against centralized exchanges continue to decrease as these financial institutions mature and adopt stronger security measures,” Dave Jevans, CipherTrace’s chief executive officer, said in an interview.

“Regulation and enforcement are restricting centralized fraud schemes, which are pushing criminals to exploit decentralized finance services,” he added.

The total number of loans on DeFi platforms was nearly $25 billion, as of late Wednesday, data from industry site DeFi Pulse showed, up more than 500% from roughly $4 billion in August last year.

DeFi sites run on open infrastructure, with algorithms that set rates in real time based on supply and demand.

“DeFi platforms enjoy many exemptions from traditional regulatory enforcement regimes that centralized exchanges, money service businesses and banks face,” said Jevans.

“For example, DeFi platforms often do not have to perform customer verification (Know Your Customer) or transaction anti-money laundering. This makes them ideal venues for moving and laundering money.”

The report also showed bitcoin addresses with criminal ties sent, at minimum, $3.5 billion worth of bitcoins throughout 2020, or less than 1% of total crypto transactions. This figure includes bitcoin addresses controlled by dark markets, ransomware actors, hackers, and fraudsters.

Jevans said the bulk of those bitcoins would be laundered by bad actors, meaning they will make their way to an exchange where they are converted to fiat currency and transferred to a bank.","Independent Reserve, one of the largest digital currency exchanges in Australia, says it will delist the bitcoin SV cryptocurrency due to controversial behavior by its team.

In an announcement Wednesday, the exchange said, “In light of recent events and community feedback, [bitcoin sv] and related trading pairs will be delisted.”

CoinDesk reached out to clarify the reasons for the move, with CEO Adrian Przelozny responding:

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

“Bitcoin is ‘The People’s Money.’ At its very core are the principles of openness and freedom and these were also the founding values of Independent Reserve. The behavior shown by the team behind BSV has been completely counter to these ideals, repeatedly spreading misinformation and making baseless threats against the community. Recent talk of legal action against developers working to improve the Bitcoin ecosystem proved to be the final straw. These are the actions of a bully and they must stop.“

Przelozny’s comments appear, in part, to reference threats by high-profile BSV proponent Craig Wright to sue entities hosting the Bitcoin white paper online, claiming he owns the copyright. Earlier this month, Wright sent take-down letters from his lawyers to several entities, with Bitcoin Core – bitcoin’s primary developer team – complying in the face of a costly legal battle.

Wright controversially claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, but has yet prove his claim to the satisfaction of most in the community and media, bar some supporters of BSV. Wright also claims BSV “is bitcoin,” making the claim in the title of his blog.

The Bitcoin white paper was originally released under the permissive MIT license, meaning anyone is free to use or distribute it. Since Wright sent out his legal letters, a number of notable entities have hosted the white paper, including Square (SQ), the city of Miami and the governmental websites of Colombia and Estonia.","Why did this happen?

Key Takeaways Crypto criminals acquired a total of $1.9 billion from hacks, frauds and thefts over the course of 2020.

A Chinese Ponzi scheme made the top of the list, with its perpetrators nabbing $1.1 billion last year.

DeFi exit scams accounted for $129 million and half of all attacks.

Share this article

CipherTrace has published its Cryptocurrency Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Report, outlining 2020’s biggest trends in digital crime.

Ponzi Schemes and Other Scams

In 2020, crypto criminals stole a total of $1.9 billion dolllars.

A Chinese Ponzi scam, WoToken, was responsible for the largest incident of theft. WoToken brought in $1.1 billion and was responsible for 58% of the year’s major crime volume.

The same team of scammers previously carried out PlusToken in 2019, which netted $2.8 billion and was responsible for 64% of the year’s criminal activity in terms of major crime volume.

CipherTrace noted that over 100 people involved in PlusToken were arrested by Chinese authorities last July.

The report also highlights a number of other scams and Ponzi schemes, including a Brazilian investment scheme ($24 mlillion), Banana.Fund ($6.5 million), Centra Tech ($25 million), and a Florida-based trading service ($6.8 million).

DeFi Exit Scams

DeFi “rug pulls” or exit scams came second in terms of value stolen.

According to CipherTrace’s report, DeFi exit scams accounted for $129 million, or 25% of all hacked volume. Furthermore, DeFi exit scams accounted for half the number of hacks carried out.

A few prominent incidents involved Harvest Finance ($24 million), Pickle Finance ($19.8 million), and bZx ($8 million), among others.

Criminals may be attracted to these platforms due to the fact that the summer of 2020 brought a tremendous inflow of money into DeFi apps. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi grew from less than a billion dollars in June to $10 billion by October, primarily due to the yield farming craze. Its TVL doubled by the end of the year.

CipherTrace noted that regulators are increasing their oversight towards DeFi applications. Quoting an SEC official, the report says that DeFi apps could soon come under “securities laws, potentially banking and lending laws” and “definitely AML/CTF laws.”

Elsewhere the EU has proposed a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law to ban DEXes altogether.

Money Laundering on Exchanges

CipherTrace additionally found that criminally associated wallets—owned by dark markets, ransomware actors, hackers, and fraudsters—moved $3.5 billion Bitcoin in 2020.

Meanwhile, U.S.-based exchanges received $8.4 million from criminals and sent $41.2 million to criminals.

CipherTrace found that a single U.S.-based exchange, which remains unnamed, was the center of several fraudulent transactions. The exchange received $3.5 million BTC and sent $36.7 million BTC directly to criminally associated addresses.

Exchange Hacks Less Prevalent

Hacks against centralized crypto exchanges were less prevalent in 2020 than they were in previous years.

Among the most notable was KuCoin, which was hacked for $281 million but managed to recover 85% of the stolen amount—“something almost unheard of,” according to CipherTrace. Other exchange thefts were carried out against Eterbase ($1.6 million) and through a series of SIM swaps ($2.5 million).



Undoubtedly, crypto security has improved in some ways due to strict rules for ICOs and crypto exchange protections. However, the industry now faces new challenges with the rise of DeFi scams and thefts, which will likely become a new focus for regulators.

2021-01-29,"Bitcoin (BTC) which seemed uncannily listless for most of this wild week, suddenly found energy after Elon Musk, the electric-vehicle and private-spaceflight entrepreneur who’s also reportedly the world’s richest man, changed his Twitter bio to mention the cryptocurrency. (See screen grab below, in Omkar Godbole’s Bitcoin Watch column.)

The price of bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, surged 12% to about $37,400, around the highest in two weeks. According to Decrypt, the sudden surge higher caused some $420 million of trader positions to be liquidated – a delicious bit of irony given Musk’s very public aversion to short-sellers, or traders who bet on price declines.

Ether (ETH), the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, was also higher, pushing back toward a new all-time high price above $1,400.

Dogecoin (DOGE), a digital token with little utility beyond the meme-iness of its doggie-faced image, has climbed eight-fold in the past two days. (Read more about that here and here and in the Market Moves column, below.)

In traditional markets, European share indexes slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open amid lingering concerns about a cash squeeze in China and the volatile retail-trader speculation highlighted by this week’s GameStop saga.

Market Moves

A new narrative is coursing through digital markets that could soon make its way to the crypto industry’s marketing departments: That a lot of individual investors, furious at Wall Street and turned off by stock markets following the GameStop (GME) episode, might find redemption by turning to cryptocurrencies.

Crypto twitterati including Alex Kruger, Balaji Srinivasan, Erik Vorhees and the Winklevoss twins jumped on the bandwagon Thursday, hammering the message that Wall Street serves its own self-interests before those of customers. And that crypto fixes this.

The industry’s opportunistic spirit is already appearing in the form of pitches and new products. Non-U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, famous for last year’s TRUMP tokens, rushed to list GameStop’s stock for tokenized futures and spot trading, as reported by CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair. Bermuda-based Bittrex Global listed tokenized GameStop (GME) shares along with other stocks delisted by the retail trading platform Robinhood, including AMC Entertainment.

Here’s a quick sampling of the commentary:

Mati Greenspan , founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told his newsletter subscribers on Thursday: ""To many involved in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the answer is very clear. Luckily for us, an alternative market has been under construction for the last few years, the decentralized marketplace. It's a place where transparency is enforced by code and not by men.""

Paulo Ardoino , CTO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and a spokesman for the stablecoin tether: ""As advocates for retail investors rail against the current structure and practices of financial markets, it is important to note that much of the work being done in the blockchain space has been inspired by these barriers. Removing obstacles to normal, everyday working people that are building and seeking wealth growing opportunities has always been part of the ethos of crypto.""

I believe we will witness a new wave of investors come over to bitcoin and other major crypto assets as a result of this debacle."" Camila Russo, founder of The Defiant newsletter: ""Decentralized finance will win. It's simply better. Freer.""

One big question, of course, is what it all might mean for cryptocurrency prices. Prices for the digital token dogecoin (DOGE), which is basically just a doggie-faced meme, have shot up in value as rumors swirled that it might be the next to draw the attention of buck-the-system (or even just fun-seeking) retail traders.

(For the DOGE-curious readers out there, the breed typically associated with dogecoin is shiba inu, which, according to the American Kennel Club’s website typically only weighs about 20 pounds but is “a well-muscled,” “spirited” and “good-natured.” Pretty cute, too!)

As discussed by First Mover on Thursday, there are already a lot of similarities between loosely regulated crypto markets, whose international reach has put large portions of the players and activity beyond the scope of usually-coordinated authorities, and the type of anything-goes, let’s-roll spirit that invaded Wall Street this week.

But it’s the mere existence of an alternative to the traditional financial system that might ultimately prove to be the biggest selling point for the crypto industry, which can also accurately claim to have the newest technology, broadly speaking.

Mohamed El-Erian, the former Pimco and Harvard money manager who now serves as chief economic adviser for the German financial conglomerate Allianz, wrote this week in a column for Bloomberg Opinion that the GameStop-inspired masses might represent a “new investor force” that “raises several interesting questions for market structure and future financial stability.”

“The dual possibility of large-scale financial volatility and market dysfunction would pose yet another challenge to an economic recovery,” El-Erian wrote.

That new investor force might represent the crypto-industry’s new hottest new lead – for motivated customers.

Screen grab of Elon Musk's twitter profile, updated to include the hashtag #bitcoin. (Twitter)

Bitcoin witnessed a sudden double-digit spike to 10-day highs on Friday.

The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid near $32,000 at around 08:30 coordinated universal time (3:30 a.m. in New York) and jumped to $37,050, the highest since Jan. 19, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The 15.7% rise happened in less than 15 minutes and more than reversed the early dip from $34,400 to $32,000.

While the exact reason for the bullish move is hard to define, prices surged after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to mention the cryptocurrency. While the bitcoin community is keen for Musk to come out as a supporter, he seemingly enjoys dropping crypto mentions as something of a tease.

Around the time he changed the bio, Musk also cryptically tweeted: “In retrospect, it was inevitable.”

Whether bitcoin’s rise will continue isn’t certain. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant’s “Exchange Whale Ratio,” calculated by dividing the top 10 bitcoin inflow transactions in an hour by total exchange inflows, jumped to an eight-month high of 0.88 early Friday, warning of a possible price drop.

However, “Elon’s tweet overrides all other bearish signals,” Ki-Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant tweeted.

Tweet of the Day","LONDON (Reuters) - A “#bitcoin” tag on Elon Musk’s Twitter profile page led to a 14% jump in the cryptocurrency on Friday, the latest in a series of market moves triggered by comments on his social media account.

The Twitter handle of the world’s richest person has joined the growing list of things to watch for those trading stocks for personal or professional purposes, and comes amid the rising prominence of the’WallStreetBets’ Reddit chat room that drove skyrocketing gains for GameStop shares.

That forum grabbed Musk’s attention too when he tweeted “Gamestonk!!” on Tuesday, along with a link to the Reddit stock trading discussion group behind the year-to-date 2,500%-plus rally in the video game retailer.

“Stonks” is a tongue-in-cheek term for stocks widely used on social media. His supporters in the Reddit forum affectionately refer to him as “Papa Musk.”

Justifiably, his tweets led to surges in other stocks too.

Shares of fast-growing Polish game developer CD Projekt soared 16% on Thursday after Musk tweeted: “The esthetics of Cyberpunk are incredible btw....”. Cyberpunk is the company’s flagship game.

Similarly, online retailing platform Etsy’s stock jumped 9% on Tuesday right after Musk tweeted: “I kinda love Etsy”. He said he bought a “hand knit wool Marvin the Martian helm” for his dog.

Shares of his own firm Tesla dipped 1.2% this week after a rally of nearly 700% over the last year.

BITCOIN RALLY

Bitcoin, meanwhile, riding on Musk’s tag, was up 10.2% to $36,901 by 1505 GMT on Friday.

The cryptocurrency jumped over 300% last year, as bigger U.S. investors and corporations sought exposure to it, and touched an all-time high of $42,000 last month.

In December, Musk asked about the possibility of converting “large transactions” of Tesla’s balance sheet into bitcoin, in a Twitter exchange with a well-known advocate for the digital currency.

“That would be a very big deal,” said Christopher Bendiksen of digital asset manager CoinShares on Friday.

Traders also cited positive comments on bitcoin by hedge fund manager Ray Dalio as supporting sentiment.

The Bridgewater Associates founder wrote on Thursday that the cryptocurrency was “one hell of an invention,” adding that he viewed it as a “gold-like alternative asset.”

Smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum and XRP that tend to move in tandem with bitcoin also jumped, as much as 5% and 8% respectively.

(Graphic: Bitcoin's blistering 2020 rally )","Bitcoin skyrocketed as much as 20% on Friday after Elon Musk added the hashtag #bitcoin to his Twitter bio.

The virtual currency climbed suddenly at around 3:30 a.m. ET, adding $5,000 in the space of an hour to trade at $37,299, according to data from industry site CoinDesk. At 8:00 a.m. ET, it extended gains to trade around $37,653.

Musk added #bitcoin to his Twitter bio earlier Friday morning. He also sent out a cryptic tweet, saying: ""In retrospect, it was inevitable.""

It adds to the wild volatility in markets this week, as the stock prices of heavily-shorted companies like GameStop and AMC surged dramatically thanks to a rush of amateur investors inspired by the Reddit forum WallStreetBets.

Another subreddit group, SatoshiStreetBets, led investors to pump up the price of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency inspired by the popular ""doge"" meme. Dogecoin was up 800% in the last 24 hours at one point.

Bitcoin's price action had been relatively muted ahead of Friday. The world's most valuable cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $41,940 earlier this month before sinking sharply a week later. It briefly fell below the $30,000 mark just last week.

The digital coin is still about 13% off its all-time high but up around 25% since the start of the year. Bitcoin more than quadrupled over the course of 2020, with crypto bulls citing increased institutional investment as a driving force of the rally.

It's not the first time Musk's tweeting habits have led to a spike in the price of an asset. The entrepreneur most recently helped extend a rally in GameStop's share price after hours Tuesday, after tweeting ""GameStonk"" and linking to the WallStreetBets Reddit community.

Meanwhile, shares of Poland's CD Projekt surged as much as 12.6% Thursday after Musk tweeted that he liked the firm's Cyberpunk 2077 game.","Why did this happen?

Cryptocurrency miners are soaring on Friday as Bitcoin recovers from its recent fall.

Shares of Marathon Patent Group, Riot Blockchain, and Bit Digital all jumped double digits on Friday before paring gains.

Bitcoin was up as much as 15% before falling slightly.

Crypto mining stocks-including Marathon Patent Group, Riot Blockchain, Bit Digital, and others-are soaring on Friday as Bitcoin's recovery continues.

Crypto miners saw their share prices plummet through January after Bitcoin fell from January 8 highs of over $40,000, momentarily dropping below $30,000 this week for the first time since Jan 2.

In the past two days though Bitcoin has recovered over 20%, and crypto mining stocks are soaring in response.

Shares of Marathon Patent Group were up as much as 20%, Bit Digital was up as much as 18%, and Riot Blockchain was up as much as 21% on the day before the stocks pared gains.

Bitcoin was up as much as 15%.

The big jump for crypto miners and for Bitcoin comes after the US Federal Reserve said on Wednesday they plan to keep monetary conditions at historically accommodative levels.

""In terms of tapering, it's just premature,"" Powell said. ""We said we'd want to see substantial, further progress towards our goals before we modify our asset purchase guidance. It's just too early to be talking about dates. We need to see actual progress.""

The move by the federal reserve is a big boost for Bitcoin, which is often seen as a hedge against fiscal and monetary imprudence.

Oki Matsumoto, CEO of Monex Group, told CoinDesk, ""there's a crazy amount of money being printed right now, so the value of money is going down. Assets with limited supply, like bitcoin, real estate or shares/stocks, those price tags are going up,""

Bitcoin's move higher on Friday was also helped by Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, including #Bitcoin in his Twitter bio.

The bullish news for crypto miners is valuable to those who bought the recent dip in the cryptocurrency.

Marathon Patent Group was able to net strong gains after the company purchased some $150 million in bitcoin at an average price of $31,167.79 per coin, the company announced earlier this week.

Merrick Okamoto, Marathon's CEO and chairman, said in a statement after the purchase, ""we also believe that holding part of our Treasury reserves in bitcoin will be a better long-term strategy than holding US Dollars,"" so far Okamoto has been right.

Based on today's prices, the 4,812.66 BTC that Marathon bought will be worth over $180 million.

Still, Bitcoin bears are still out there, despite the latest jump higher.

Gabriel Makhlouf, a European Central Bank governing council member, even said Bitcoin investors need to be prepared to ""lose all their money,"" per Bloomberg.

Shares of Marathon Patent Group traded at $22.03 as of 10:45 AM EST, while Riot Blockchain and Bit Digital traded at $22.20 and $20.70 respectively.","Bitcoin, BTC to USD, rose by 2.63% on Friday. Following on from a 9.70% rally on Thursday, Bitcoin ended the day at $34,253.0.

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to a late morning intraday low $31,987.0 before making a move.

While steering clear of the first major support level at $30,927, Bitcoin fell through the 23.6% FIB of $33,008.

Finding late morning support, Bitcoin rallied to an early afternoon intraday high $38,710.7 before hitting reverse.

Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $34,809 and the second major resistance level at $36,246.

More significantly, Bitcoin also broke back through the 23.6% FIB of $33,008.

The reversal, however, saw Bitcoin slide back through the major resistance levels to revisit sub-$34,000 levels.

Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB, Bitcoin moved back through to $34,000 levels to deliver the upside on the day.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the recent sell-off. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $18,504 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Friday.

Chainlink (-1.37%) and Polkadot (-2.97%) saw red to buck the trend on the day.

It was a bullish day the rest of the majors, however.

Ripple’s XRP rallied by 6.89% to lead the pack

Ethereum (+3.47%), Crypto.com Coin (+3.65%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (+3.47%) also found strong support.

Binance Coin (+0.41%), Cardano’s ADA (+0.60%), and Litecoin (+0.88%) trailed the front runners, however.

In the current week, the crypto total market cap fell to a Wednesday low $847.51bn before rising to a Friday high $1,136.27bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $997.86bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance rose from a Monday low 62.54% to a Friday high 65.93%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 64.21%.

This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.69% to $34,490.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning low $34,244.7 before striking a high $34,900.0.

Story continues

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day.

Bitcoin Cash SV and Ripple’s XRP were up by 1.12% and by 0.52% to join Bitcoin in the green.

It was a bearish start for the rest of the majors, however.

At the time of writing, Crypto.com Coin was down by 4.09% to lead the way down.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to move through the pivot level at $34,984 to bring the first major resistance level at $37,980 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $37,000 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Friday’s high $38,710.7 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $40,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $41,707.

Failure to move through the $34,984 pivot would bring 23.6% FIB of $33,008 and the first major support level at $31,256 into play.

Barring an extended crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$30,000 levels. The second major support level sits at $28,260.

2021-01-30,"India's government plans to introduce a bill in the country's lower house that would ban private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and create a national cryptocurrency.

The so-called ""Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill"" moves ""to create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India.""

Additionally, ""the bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.""

Fronted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the right-wing Bhartiya Janata Party currently have control of India's two houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha), giving the legislation a strong possibility of passing.","India’s cryptocurrency investors were caught off-guard and left confused after news broke Friday that the country’s Parliament will be considering a government-backed bill that would ban “private” cryptocurrencies. Given the ruling party controls both houses of Parliament, the bill’s chances of becoming law are good.

The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021 would prohibit cryptocurrencies in India and provide a framework for creating an official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI had previously prohibited crypto trading for almost two years before that ban was overturned by the Supreme Court in March 2020.

Industry watchers said the government’s definition of “private” could imply that any digital currency that is not sovereign could be seen as a “private” currency, including bitcoin. It’s unclear which cryptocurrencies would be affected because the bill allows for certain unspecified exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.

“This is (the) time to be nervous,” an official at a large cryptocurrency exchange said to the Economic Times of India on the condition of anonymity.

The move is bound to make potential and current crypto investors outside the country nervous as well. When naming potential obstacles to the growth of bitcoin as a store of value, one of the first noted is that governments will try to ban it should it become too successful. This past week, while appearing more warmly disposed toward bitcoin than he had in the past, Ray Dalio, the founder and co-chairman of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, listed government prohibition of bitcoin as one of his remaining concerns regarding the cryptocurrency. That one of the world’s biggest economies seems poised to do just that seems to confirm that concern. News of the likely ban may have been a contributing factor in the fallback in the price of bitcoin Friday after it had risen in response to Elon Musk’s Twitter-bio shout-out.

Nischal Shetty, CEO of Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, criticized the announcement via Twitter, explaining that “there is no such thing as a private cryptocurrency” and the bill is aimed at helping the RBI create its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) by banning so-called private cryptocurrencies, with some exceptions.

“A country as large as India should at least work on understanding the underlying terminologies before presenting technology-related bills in Parliament – seems like a hurried move,” said Shetty.

Noting there is still a chance the bill may not become law, he warned that “wrong or hasty regulations will set us [India] back by a decade. Right regulations will catapult India to the forefront of this technology.”","The RBI is likely to wait and watch the launch of other developments around the world before taking the decision on India's fiat cryptocurrency

The main concern is around crypto being used as currency, while startups are looking to promote it as an asset, say founders

The bill has proposed a complete ban on private cryptocurrencies and deals with an official digital currency

As the budget session of the parliament commenced with the President Ram Nath Kovind addressing the joint sitting of the two houses on January 29, the government has also published a list of 20 new bills to be introduced in the parliament, including the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021.

Based on the draft Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019, the bill aims to provide a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.

The bill, entitled, “Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019,” was drafted by an inter-ministerial committee headed by former Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) secretary Subhash Chandra Garg.

Banning Of Private Cryptocurrencies Puts Startups On Red Alert

The entire Draft Bill can be divided into two parts:

Banning private cryptocurrencies Paving way for official digital currency

The Interministerial Group which has drafted the Bill has proposed a complete an on private cryptocurrencies in India citing the risks associated with them and volatility in their prices.

The news has arrived after the Indian crypto industry saw an exponential rise in funding with global investors pouring money into Indian startups. While newly launched Sequoia-backed CoinSwitch Kuber raised $15 Mn led by Ribbit Capital and Paradigm, CoinDCX raised around $19 Mn led by Polychain Capital and Block.One in Series A and B rounds of funding.

Commenting on the announcement of the bill being tabled this Session, WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty said that it’s a good thing that the government has shown intent for a central bank digital currency and wants to initiate laws to make it easy for RBI to create its own CBDC.

“The concern is around the last statement in the description which says they want to ban all private cryptocurrency with some exceptions. I believe here the government’s concern is around the usage of crypto as a currency. As an industry, we’re in sync with crypto not being a currency but an asset/utility which people buy and sell,” Shetty told Inc42.

Barring few use-cases such as for study/research purposes, the draft bill 2019 proposed a huge penalty for any who directly or indirectly mines, generates, holds, sells, deals in, transfers, disposes of, or issues cryptocurrency. Under Section 7 of the bill, this will be punishable with fine or with imprisonment which shall not be less than one year but which may extend up to ten years, or both.

Sumit Gupta, founder and CEO of CoinDCX and Shivam Thakral, cofounder and CEO of BuyUcoin and other crypto founders have suggested that the government must take the opinion of the stakeholders while introducing enacting on such a Bill.

“We urge the government to take the opinion of all the stakeholders before taking a decision which may affect the livelihood of the entire workforce employed in digital asset industry in India,” Thakral said.

Vijay Pal Dalmia, partner, Vaish Associates and the Supreme Court lawyer who was among the firsts to file a PIL demanding a complete ban on cryptocurrencies in India, welcomed the move and said, “Though this should have been introduced much earlier, it is completely in sync with the concerns I had raised in my PIL.”

Will The Bill Pave The Way For Fiat Cryptocurrency?

The RBI has been mulling to introduce a fiat cryptocurrency since 2017. An RBI official earlier told Inc42 that the plan didn’t see much groundwork in late 2018 and 2019 as Bitcoin continued to dip in and many of the countries such as Russia and China who were working on fiat-crypto projects too didn’t launch their official cryptocurrencies as expected.

Will India take lead in launching its own fiat cryptocurrency?

The officer on the condition of anonymity said,

“Not right now. We have planned to adopt wait and watch policy instead of going ahead with the project. While the project might be executed in pilot mode, there is no plan to launch it fully ahead of other major countries.”

While China and Russia have been actively working on the project and are expected to launch their fiat cryptocurrencies soon, countries like Venezuela which launched their fiat cryptocurrency called Petro didn’t succeed and has been banned by most of the countries.

The Road Ahead

The bill once introduced in the parliament is expected to be referred to the standing committee or a joint parliamentary committee. And, this could be the last opportunity for cryptocurrency startups and investors to raise their concerns with these lawmakers.

“I also believe that this bill, if presented in Parliament will be referred to a standing committee so that they hold discussions with the crypto industry of India before moving ahead with regulations for this sector,” added WazirX’s Shetty.

CoinDCX’s Gupta said, “We are talking to other stakeholders and will definitely initiate deeper dialogue with the government and showcase how we can actually create a healthy ecosystem in unison.”

While the draft has proposed a ban on cryptocurrencies, the startup founders have questioned the move and the government’s capacity whether it can really ban cryptocurrencies which are traded internationally.

Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO of Cashaa said that there cannot be a true ban on crypto anyway.","World's Largest Hedge Fund Bridgewater Has Crypto Plans — Founder Ray Dalio Calls Bitcoin 'One Hell of an Invention'

The founder and chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund firm, has clarified his view on bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Ray Dalio also reveals that he and his colleagues at Bridgewater “are intently focusing on alternative storehold of wealth assets.”

Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio ‘Greatly’ Admires Bitcoin

Ray Dalio, founder and chief investment officer of Bridgewater, has clarified his view on bitcoin and revealed what his company has in store for cryptocurrency. With about $140 billion in assets under management, his hedge fund is the largest in the world. AICIO Magazine and Wired Magazine have called Dalio the “Steve Jobs of Investing,” and TIME Magazine has named him one of the 100 Most Influential People.

In a research note published on the Bridgewater Associates’ website on Thursday, Dalio wrote: “I am writing this to clarify what I think of bitcoin. Please pay attention to what I am saying here and not what those in the media are saying I said because this is reliable.”

He began by admitting that he is not an expert on bitcoin or cryptocurrency. “Still, people demand my non-expert assessment of bitcoin and clarifications in my own words are better than distortions in the media so here it goes, presented with the warning not to rely on it,” Dalio declared, elaborating:

I believe bitcoin is one hell of an invention. To have invented a new type of money via a system that is programmed into a computer and that has worked for around 10 years and is rapidly gaining popularity as both a type of money and a storehold of wealth is an amazing accomplishment.

Emphasizing the current need for “alternative gold-like assets,” Dalio asserted that “Because there aren’t many of these gold-like storehold of wealth assets that can be held in privacy and because the sizes of their markets are relatively small, there exists the possibility that bitcoin and its competitors can fill that growing need.”

The Bridgewater founder noted: “It seems to me that bitcoin has succeeded in crossing the line from being a highly speculative idea that could well not be around in short order to probably being around and probably having some value in the future.”

He further said: “I greatly admire how bitcoin has stood the test of 10 years of time, not only in this regard but also in how its technology has been working so well and has not been hacked.” Nonetheless, the Bridgewater executive cautioned that those “holding digital/cyber assets at a time when cyber offense is much more powerful than cyber defense, the cyber risk is a risk that I can’t ignore.”

In conclusion, Dalio said bitcoin looks to him “like a long-duration option on a highly unknown future that I could put an amount of money in that I wouldn’t mind losing about 80% of.” He concluded, “That is what bitcoin looks like to this non-expert. I am eager to be corrected and learn more,” elaborating:

Believe me when I tell you that I and my colleagues at Bridgewater are intently focusing on alternative storehold of wealth assets.

Dalio further revealed: “Expect Bridgewater to soon offer an alt-cash fund and a storehold of wealth fund in order to better deal with the devaluation of money and credit that we consider to be a major risk and opportunity, and bitcoin won’t escape our scrutiny.” The head of Bridgewater clarified that when he uses the word “bitcoin,” he means “bitcoin and its analogous competitors.”

Dalio has recently been talking more about bitcoin. In November, he admitted that he may be wrong about the cryptocurrency but still had doubts. In December, he said bitcoin could be an alternative storehold of wealth to gold.

And it goes without saying, to the extent a specific digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there's no reason why we cannot add it to our network, which already supports over 160 currencies today.”","India plans to introduce a law to ban private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in the country and provide a framework for the creation of an official digital currency during the current budget session of parliament.

In the agenda (PDF) published on the lower house website, the legislation seeks to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India,” but allow “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology [blockchain] of cryptocurrency and its uses.”

The law also seeks to “create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency” that will be issued by the nation’s central bank, Reserve Bank of India, the agenda said.

In 2018, an Indian government panel recommended banning all private cryptocurrencies and proposed up to 10 years of jail time for offenders. The panel also suggested the government to explore a digital version of the fiat currency and ways to implement it.

At the time, RBI said the move was necessary to curb “ring-fencing” of the country’s financial system. It had also argued that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be treated as currencies as they are not made of metal or exist in physical form, nor were they stamped by the government. The 2018 notice from the central bank sent a panic to several local startups and companies offering services to trade in cryptocurrency. Nearly all of them have either since closed shop, or pivoted to serve other markets.

This proposal was challenged by several exchanges and traders, who filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court. The nation’s apex court ruled in their favor last year. This ruling was seen as “historic” but it did not impact the earlier circular on the policy level.

“Since the government is considering introducing the bill during this session of Parliament, we are sure the government will definitely listen to all the stakeholders before taking any decision,” said Sumit Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of CoinDCX,a cryptocurrency exchange in India.

“We are talking to other stakeholders and will definitely initiate deeper dialogue with the government and showcase how we can actually create a healthy ecosystem in unison,” he said.","The Treasury: Riled up about reporting

This week, the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN, extended by 60 days the comment period for proposed reporting rules on digital wallet transactions that it says would prevent money laundering. First announced on Dec. 23, with a 15-day comment period, the move incited outrage in the crypto community. The regulator has twice relented, noting the “robust” engagement that came after what opponents called “midnight rulemaking” by Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury at the time.

It showed the crypto industry could force a pivot by a powerful agency. They argue that the proposed disclosure and record-keeping requirements are “arbitrary and unjustified,” as Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square wrote in a comment letter:

The incongruity between the treatment of cash and cryptocurrency under FinCEN’s proposal will inhibit adoption of cryptocurrency and invade the privacy of individuals. Yet, the rule fails to explain the difference in risk.

The procedural win doesn’t guarantee that the new secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen, will shift gears on the matter. At her confirmation hearing, she suggested that many cryptocurrency transactions were associated with illicit activity, which Ms. Smith of the Blockchain Association called “a very disappointing reaction.” In written testimony released later, Ms. Yellen offered a more nuanced take, saying regulators should “look closely at how to encourage their use for legitimate activities while curtailing their use for malign and illegal activities.”

The C.F.T.C.: Act fast

Chris Brummer, a professor at Georgetown Law and a “fintech guru,” is in the running to become the next commissioner of the C.F.T.C. Picked for the same gig in 2016, his nomination was withdrawn by the Trump administration. Since then, Mr. Brummer has testified before Congress on blockchain policy, edited an online journal and book on crypto assets, and written a textbook, “Fintech Law in a Nutshell.” He’s an expert, in other words.

Whoever takes over, “knowledge can’t fill the major regulatory gaps,” Mr. Massad, of Harvard, said. In his view, however crypto savvy the next financial regulators are, they can’t solve the problems that are raised by new technologies without a comprehensive law designed for digital assets. Otherwise, too much crypto activity will be left unregulated for too long.

A case in point, perhaps, is the civil enforcement action filed in the fall by the C.F.T.C., accusing BitMEX, a cryptocurrency exchange, of operating an unregistered trading platform selling crypto derivatives. It is accused of facilitating transactions that earned more than $1 billion in fees since 2014 without “the most basic compliance procedures.” BitMEX owes a reply next month. In a companion criminal case, the Department of Justice contends that BitMEX execs deliberately flouted anti-money laundering rules.","Crypto Fund Manager Charged in $5M Ponzi Scheme, Facing up to 30 Years in US Prison

A cryptocurrency fund manager has been charged in a U.S. federal court. He allegedly took over $5 million from investors interested in investing in his crypto funds, promising them high returns. In reality, he was running a Ponzi scheme and is now facing up to 30 years in prison.

Crypto Fund Manager Arrested for Running a Ponzi Scheme

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday that Jeremy Spence has been arrested and charged in Manhattan federal court in a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. The 24-year-old from Bristol, Rhode Island, is also known as “Coin Signals.”

Spence is “a cryptocurrency trader who solicited funds for various cryptocurrency funds that he operated, with commodities fraud and wire fraud offenses,” the DOJ described, adding:

Spence took cryptocurrency worth over $5 million from more than 170 individual investors after making false representations in connection with these cryptocurrency funds.

U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss explained that the defendant “allegedly lured investors to his cryptocurrency investment scam by touting returns of up to 148%.” However, his investment pools consistently lost money.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney further detailed that Spence allegedly “used money from new investors to pay off others in order to keep his plan moving — a typical marker of a Ponzi scheme.”

According to the Justice Department, from November 2017 through April 2019, Spence solicited investors for several cryptocurrency investment funds that he had created and managed. Investors “would transfer cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin and ethereum,” to him to invest in the funds for them. The DOJ elaborated:

The largest and most active of which were the Coin Signals Bitmex Fund, a/k/a the ‘CS Mex Fund,’ the Coin Signals Alternative Fund, a/k/a the ‘CS Alt Fund,’ and the Coin Signals Long Term Fund.

Spence is charged with one count of commodities fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has also filed a federal civil enforcement action against Spence, charging him with fraud for operating the Ponzi scheme.

So Do the Police.

Chris Janczewski was finishing up a lengthy investigation into online drug trafficking in Thailand when a source called him about a website in South Korea. Hosted on the darknet, the site encouraged users—including U.S. citizens—to pay Bitcoin to access over a million videos depicting the rape and sexual assault of children as young as six months old.

A special agent with the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigations division, Janczewski was used to tracing cryptocurrency transactions to track money laundering and other forms of organized crime. But he had never worked on a child sexual abuse case. “I was like, well surely the FBI or Homeland Security or somebody is already doing something about this,” he recalls. “Like, why does the IRS need to do something? And then I was poking around and I realized: Nobody was doing it.”

For the next two years, until late 2019, Janczewski found himself at the forefront of the investigation and takedown of what the U.S. Department of Justice has dubbed “the largest darknet child pornography website” in the world.

Cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used to fund child sexual exploitation (CSE), creating new opportunities for law enforcement to track down perpetrators. But experts say success stories are rare: Unlike those responsible for big money crimes like drug trafficking and money laundering, agents tasked with investigating CSE lack the training, knowledge, and resources to pursue the growing number of operations financed by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. With law enforcement behind the curve, hundreds of thousands of sexual predators go uninvestigated, and are free to continue victimizing children.

Contrary to popular belief, some of the most mainstream cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin, can be easily tracked; every transaction is logged in a shared, public ledger known as a blockchain. Criminals can employ various techniques to try and obfuscate their spending, but the records—while harder to find—remain. “I pay you $2,000 in a dark alley, who are the witnesses to that transaction? Just you and I, right?” said Pamela Clegg, director of financial investigations and education at the blockchain analytics company CipherTrace. “With cryptocurrency… the whole world could be the witness.”

But a lack of understanding of what cryptocurrency is and what its use in child exploitation looks like often leads anti-trafficking investigators in the United States and globally to reject cases, or miss crucial pieces of evidence. Clegg cites an example from 2017 in which a team of experienced law enforcement officials from Central America uncovered a website hosting child sex abuse materials (CSAM), complete with Bitcoin addresses that could have identified dozens of users. The team didn’t know how to capture the data before taking down the website and mistakenly lost all of the information.

“I don’t want to paint this as ‘law enforcement doesn’t have experience in crypto,’” Clegg explains. “Law enforcement does amazing work with crypto. It’s primarily the teams that are focused on human trafficking and CSAM that I’m referring to.” In 2019, she gave a speech to 750 members of law enforcement from almost 100 countries, each a specialist in investigating human trafficking and child sexual exploitation. “I asked, ‘How many people have actually worked a case that involved cryptocurrency?’” To Clegg’s dismay, just five people raised their hands.

Around the world, governments are failing to prioritize cryptocurrency analysis in child sexual exploitation investigations, agrees Neil Walsh, chief of the Cybercrime, Anti-Money Laundering / Counter Financing of Terrorism Department at the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). “It seems to me that this is still seen as a niche area: That it’s a bit geeky and not something that is common.”

Meanwhile, the rate at which sex predators are spending virtual money is far outpacing anti-trafficking agents’ capacity to track them. According to Chainalysis, a U.S.-based blockchain analysis company, the amount of money paid in Bitcoin and Ethereum to known child abuse websites nearly quadrupled between 2017 and 2019, topping 1.75 million dollars.

Some cryptocurrency pioneers are exacerbating the problem by ramping up privacy preservation and data protection to make transactions fully anonymous. Of the roughly 4000 cryptocurrencies currently listed on the price-tracking website CoinMarketCap, private analysts and senior IRS investigators say only a handful—like Bitcoin and Ethereum—are straightforward to trace. Even then, it requires the right training and tools.

“We’re in an arms race here,” said Rebecca Portnoff, director of data science at THORN, a U.S. organization working to build technology to counter child sex abuse. “And it’s a pretty complicated arms race.”

But Clegg says that training isn’t prioritized for these cases because the purchase and sale of online child sexual abuse materials amounts to just a fraction of what changes hands in white collar or drug crimes—most payments are between $10 and $50.

To take down Welcome To Video, the South Korean child exploitation site, Janczewski and a skeleton team of agents from the IRS and Homeland Security Investigations teamed up with the Korean National Police. Together, they spent two years tracing thousands of Bitcoin addresses, leading to the arrest of 340 men in 38 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia. At least 25 children were rescued from situations of abuse.

Janczewski believes other federal agencies had overlooked Welcome to Video because they didn’t have the expertise or the necessary manpower. “The child exploitation investigators were very good, but they rarely had to look at cryptocurrencies and that’s a large learning curve,” he said. “And they’re just too busy.” On occasions when he shared a lead with other agencies, he often checked back in weeks later to discover they hadn’t made any progress. “In one example, the agent was like, ‘Yeah, I’d really like to work this case, but it takes a lot of effort for me to work out what’s going on.’”

The case was no less time consuming for officials in Korea. As chief of the Korean National Police’s cyber investigation division since 2018, Jong-sang Choi oversaw dozens of agents tasked with investigating Welcome to Video. The site catered to up to a million users and tracing their crypto transactions was challenging—“a fight between a spear and a shield,” Jong-sang recalled.

Despite Jong-sang and Janczewski’s best efforts, the majority of Welcome to Video’s users likely got away with their crimes. In several cases, investigators would trace Bitcoin addresses to foreign countries, only for the relevant authorities to ignore their reports. “Not only are they not interested,” Jong-sang said, “but they’re not capable.”

“It’s about turning this technical challenge into a mainstream part of investigative technology,” said Walsh of the UNODC. “And that requires political leadership domestically and internationally.”

Consumers of CSAM are everywhere, but demand is driven largely by people in wealthy countries. One study from the Philippines found that three-quarters of people who purchased materials depicting child sexual abuse were from the U.S., Sweden, and Australia. Meanwhile, 81 percent of child sexual abuse materials are produced in low-income regions, including in South East Asia, Africa, and Latin America, according to the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children. In many of these countries, the tools required to analyze virtual transactions are prohibitively expensive. “If you’re in the UK or the U.S., the ability to invest in a blockchain analyzer is very possible,” said Walsh. “However, if you are from an economically developing country, then that’s really difficult to do.”

Instead of relying on resource-stretched agencies and governments in low-income countries to independently investigate CSE crimes using cryptocurrency, some experts have called on financial institutions—such as the “exchanges” that can convert cryptocurrency into other assets, including traditional, government-issued money—to introduce protocols to identify and report suspicious activity to authorities.

In May 2020, Aaron Kahler, founder of the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative, launched the Anti-Trafficking Cryptocurrency Consortium after seeing a “huge lapse” in the investigation of child sexual abuse by both U.S. law enforcement and financial institutions. “It’s still not a priority,” he said, explaining that the nonprofit consortium is working to encourage exchanges to cooperate with law enforcement, while providing U.S. investigators with much-needed tools and expertise.

Since shutting down Welcome to Video, Janczewski has collaborated with European investigators to trace over 300 Bitcoin addresses linked to a Dutch-hosted site called Dark Scandals, which sold more than 2000 videos of women and children being raped. In March of last year, authorities arrested the site’s administrator.

Janczewski admits he didn’t initially understand how prolific the use of cryptocurrency was in child sexual abuse or the role the IRS could play in combatting it. But he does now.

“Once I got into it, I realized this is the thing.”"
2021-01-31,"A new bill listed for introduction in Parliament seeks to bar all private cryptocurrencies in India. It comes nearly a year after the Supreme Court quashed a Reserve Bank of India ban on crypto-related payments. Mint decodes what the bill means for crypto investors.

How does fiat money compare to crypto?

Traditional currency is maintained in paper or metal form, such as notes and coins, or in electronic form in account entries made by banks. Cryptocurrency is also a form of electronic money. The difference is that the record of cryptocurrency is maintained simultaneously by thousands of computers instead of a centralized entity such as a bank. Thus, the record of cryptocurrency can’t be tampered with by any person or authority. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin also tend to have limited supply. This has raised their price in the face of large money printing by central banks around the world following the covid-19 pandemic.

What sets blockchain apart from crypto?

Blockchain is a technological system that is used for maintaining records in a manner that they cannot be easily tampered with. The system can be applied to any type of record like educational certificates, land, or as in case of cryptocurrency, money. Governments globally have taken a positive view of blockchain and a negative view of cryptocurrency. This also appears to be the view taken in the crypto bill to be tabled in the Parliament. However, experts argue that the two cannot be separated. They say blockchain is powered by cryptocurrency and cannot function effectively without the latter.

Does India consider crypto as a legitimate currency?

In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India banned banks from processing payments linked to cryptocurrency. This ban was overturned by the Supreme Court in March 2020 as violative of the freedom of business and profession under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Since then, the cryptocurrency sector has operated in a legal vacuum in India.

What does the govt’s crypto bill propose?

The bill listed by the government, for introduction in the Parliament, seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies and lay the groundwork for an official digital currency. Such official currencies are being contemplated by several central banks around the world, including China. Cryptocurrency professionals have argued that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether operate on public ledgers and hence cannot be called ‘private’ cryptocurrencies. The detailed provisions of the bill have not yet been released to the public.

Should you sell your cryptocurrency?

The detailed legislation will offer more clarity on whether you should sell your cryptocurrency. The bill, however, mentions that certain exceptions may be made to preserve the underlying tech of cryptos (blockchain). Not all bills introduced in the Parliament are passed in the same session. The bill could be referred to a panel or deferred to a later session. Earlier investments in cryptos cannot be criminalized because of Article 20 (1) of the Constitution, which prohibits the state from passing retrospective criminal laws.

Share Via","It’s hard to do justice to the symbolism and significance of the Reddit-Robinhood-GameStop drama of this past week.

That’s not to say it hasn’t been overblown in some quarters. I’ve heard it compared to the Capitol riots – no, that was sedition, this is rebellion, very different. I’ve seen calls for the regulators to step in and shut down retail trading platforms, even though it’s not clear a crime has been committed. And I’ve read takes painting the leaders of this charge as “misfits.” That condescension itself is part of the problem.

The protagonists are not misfits – they are retail investors flexing their collective muscle, the very same muscle the “establishment” encouraged them to develop.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.

Retail investors were encouraged to invest their savings in the stock market. They were offered mobile apps that made it easy. They were bombarded with advice and ideas from mainstream media. They were given money to spend. And low yields pushed them up the risk curve.

Making way

While the attention has been focused on a handful of stocks that have seen astronomical gains on the back of retail enthusiasm, the origin and the result (whatever that ends up being) have a lot to do with the crypto markets.

We’re not trying to steal anyone’s thunder. The WallStreetBets channel that galvanized the troops and led the charge did not welcome crypto traders or even chatter. Their drivers are not decentralization or fair access – rather, they seem motivated by glee at their newfound power, and anger.

The anger runs deep. The 139% short position against GameStop signaled heavy hedge fund involvement – but this was a trigger, not a cause. This rebellion feels like an expression of pent-up frustration at the skewed rules of capital markets that entrench the power of the “elite,” combined with residual resentment over the 2008 bailouts, the lack of market transparency and a long list of generational grievances.

A similar “old” vs. “new” mindset drives the crypto markets.

Many of us were drawn to bitcoin out of concern for the impact on individual prosperity from defensive decisions taken by entrenched interests. Others were attracted to the concept of decentralized finance as an antidote to the potential damage done by consolidated power. And there’s the strong vote for financial sovereignty and commercial freedom.

All of us watched how traditional finance initially rejected the notion that a programmable token could ever have value or that code could produce yield. The success of crypto markets has forced much of the “old guard” to gradually recognize that things are changing. The events of this week will no doubt drive home that message.

What’s more, the very same platforms that sold themselves on the democratization of finance ended up restricting users’ access to certain trades this week, with the market in full swing. Can you think of a more public spotlight on the vulnerabilities inherent in the current market infrastructure? Google Trends shows that searches for “defi” (short for decentralized finance) are growing.

There is a risk the new Biden administration in the U.S. will use the retail investor rebellion as an excuse to over-regulate. Yet, popular sentiment seems to be with the rebels, as legislators are no doubt aware. (I don’t recall ever seeing Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz agree with N.Y. Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez before.)

What’s more, the nomination of Gary Gensler, who is both knowledgeable and generally supportive of crypto markets, to the post of chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could hint at the beginning of structural reform in favor of more “democratic” access.

It could also move the needle on investor understanding of some of the underlying qualities of blockchain-based assets and their markets. True, access to these markets has some hurdles, such as jurisdiction and familiarity with technology. But investor choice and user experience has never been better, and, with some large market infrastructure players intending to go public this year, will continue to improve.

Back to basics

It’s not just market structure that is likely to be re-examined as a result of this week’s events. Market understanding needs a rethink, too. This also has a lot to do with crypto assets.

I lost count this week of the number of mainstream commentators who sputtered about “fundamentals,” and how the price shouldn’t move so much when GameStop’s (GME) situation hasn’t changed. They’re wrong – whether the stock is currently overvalued or not (I have no opinion on that), the company’s situation and fundamentals have changed.

One, there’s the massive publicity. Two, aside from the potential future revenue from selling games, there is probably a merchandising opportunity through branded mugs and pitchforks. Three, there’s a groundswell of support for the share price – only this is not traditionally considered worthy of consideration in asset evaluation. It should be.

Investopedia defines business fundamentals as “information such as profitability, revenue, assets, liabilities, and growth potential.” I would add to that list “public support.” Critics of this idea will say that sentiment is ephemeral, impractical to estimate and therefore impossible to value, while traditional fundamentals are tangible and can be discounted.

These days, though, even the tangible ones are mere estimates, which – as we have seen – can vary wildly and be rendered useless by unforeseen events. We have also seen how sentiment moves markets, and not just on a short-term basis. No analyst can reasonably ignore its power, and insisting that portfolio decisions “stick to the basics” is assuming that things will go back to the way they were 50 years ago when investors parked their money in safe securities and forgot about them until retirement.

The power unleashed this week may remind some of us oldies of 1999, when market fever crested before crashing. But back then we didn’t have the power of social media, a generation stuck indoors and helicopter money from the federal government. We also weren’t looking at an unprecedented level of social dislocation, loss of trust in institutions and belief in the strength of community. Today’s markets may turn south at any moment, and when they do it is likely to be ugly. But in contrast to the turn of the century, retail participation is unlikely to fade – this cultural shift is about more than making money.

The newfound power of retail investors has showed that sentiment not only trumps earnings forecasts, it can impact them. The very same investors piling into the stock are the same demographic that GameStop’s future business will target. The collective power showed that market mood is a fundamental characteristic of markets, now more than ever. Some of the price jumps this week may have been driven by hedge funds that understand this and were placing buy orders accordingly.

While volatility is likely to eventually quiet down and business analysis should always have a significant role in investment decisions, we can no longer say that sentiment isn’t a fundamental component of an asset’s price outlook.

This is especially relevant with crypto assets. Critics have often accused bitcoin of having no “fundamental value,” by which they mean no cash flow, balance sheet or potential earnings growth. True, it doesn’t have these things, but it does have widespread belief in its utility, monetary policy and eventual adoption by an even broader community. That faith should be considered a fundamental characteristic, as it is now obvious it drives price appreciation.

Bitcoin is not the only clear example of that. This week saw the price of dogecoin (DOGE) at one stage surge tenfold (up 500% at time of writing), briefly pushing the cryptocurrency into the list of top 10 crypto assets by market capitalization. DOGE doesn’t do anything special. It has a cute dog as its logo. Its founder disavowed the project ages ago. Some people have hyped it as a joke which then became part of its narrative – in other words, its unpretentious lack of fundamentals has become part of its value. We may deride people who put savings into a purely sentiment-driven asset – but that sentiment has kept DOGE alive for over six years now, and has attracted a smattering of high-profile followers.

New language

As an analyst trained in “old-school” valuations and portfolio allocation techniques, I understand the reluctance to let go of comfortable heuristics – personally, I miss discounted cash flows, so nice and clean. But as market components and participants change, so must market analysis. Does anyone even remember when last “value stocks” were in favor?

Crypto markets have for some time been pushing the boundaries of what “value” means. The new generation of investors is showing us that old rules need re-examining.

They are also permanently blurring the boundaries between institutional “smart money” and retail “dumb money.” What’s more, they are showing that reform can be initiated by those that previously have had little influence on how profits are made.

This is the crypto market origin and ethos in a nutshell: new rules for a new type of investor. The crypto asset market was born in the retail world and cultivated from the ground up. It attracts investors looking for an alternative to the traditional system. It has given birth to new metrics and valuation paradigms.

All of us who work in this industry have watched this week’s power shift with the feeling that what we’ve been expecting is finally starting to happen: A new type of investor is insisting on new rules and a new language, and mainstream markets are starting to take note. This new type of investor – be they angry at elites and unequal rules, fascinated by the emergence of a new type of asset, or both – will force a rewrite of some long-established rules of investment, and in so doing, push the philosophy behind the term “value” towards a more flexible definition for our changing times.

CHAIN LINKS

Investors talking:

Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, published a document laying out his thoughts on bitcoin. This is remarkable, given that not long ago he publicly expressed skepticism that it would succeed.

Some excerpts:

""I believe Bitcoin is one hell of an invention.""

""There aren’t many alternative gold-like assets at this time of rising need for them.""

""It seems to me that Bitcoin has succeeded in crossing the line from being a highly speculative idea that could well not be around in short order to probably being around and probably having some value in the future.""

""The new paradigm that we are living in, with many government bonds no longer offering the same return or diversification characteristics and currencies facing greater risk of depreciation, could propel development of alternative storeholds of wealth faster than might otherwise have been the case.""

Elon Musk now has “bitcoin” and its logo in his Twitter bio and flagged this with the tweet: “In retrospect, it was inevitable.”

Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, told Bloomberg television this week he does not believe bitcoin’s institutional investor base is “big enough” or “deep enough” to justify its current valuation.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood revealed that recent conversations with large companies leads her to believe that more will follow Square’s (SQ) lead and allocate a portion of their treasury to bitcoin. She also said at this week’s ETF Big Ideas Event that she doubts a bitcoin exchange-traded fund will be approved until the asset’s market cap hits $2 trillion.

Bank of Singapore, a private banking arm of OCBC Bank (the second-largest bank in Southest Asia by total assets), said in a research note that cryptocurrencies have the potential to partially replace gold as a store of value if they can overcome the hurdles high volatility, reputational risk and lack of regulatory acceptance.

Takeaways:

According to sources, some of the largest university endowment funds in the U.S., including Harvard, Yale, Brown and the University of Michigan, have been quietly buying cryptocurrency since 2019. TAKEAWAY: This is notable, given endowments’ traditionally conservative investor profile. The allocations are most likely relatively small, but even so, the AUM of college endowments is in the hundreds of billions of dollars – small can go a long way. It will also be worth keeping an eye on endowment activism – some universities, especially Harvard, have come under criticism for their investment in fossil fuel companies. Bitcoin’s (misconstrued) reputation as bad for the climate might attract their attention.

According to Genesis Capital’s latest quarterly report, its total volume of active loans outstanding increased by over 80% in Q4, to $3.8 billion. Loan originations increased by 46% to $7.6 billion, the average loan size doubled from $2 million to $4 million, and the average loan size for first-time lenders increased from $0.6 million to $3.2 million. TAKEAWAY: These growth figures highlight the growing awareness amongst institutional investors of the yields possible in crypto lending, and as long as yields remain low in traditional markets, growth should continue to be strong. This supports healthy liquidity in crypto markets, which in turn should help strengthen market infrastructure and could gradually mitigate asset volatility. (Note: Genesis Capital is owned by DCG, also parent of CoinDesk.)

On business intelligence company MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) latest earnings call, CEO Michael Saylor pledged to keep pouring the business intelligence company’s excess cash into bitcoin, telling investors his team will also “explore various approaches” for additional buys. TAKEAWAY: They really are working on becoming a bitcoin ETF.

Cryptocurrency mining company Marathon Patent Group (MARA) bought $150 million in bitcoin during the crypto asset’s recent price rout. TAKEAWAY: Here we have a bitcoin mining company buying BTC on the open market in order to become even more of a “pure play” for the asset. And yet a bitcoin ETF is still deemed too risky.

The city of Miami on Wednesday uploaded a copy of the Bitcoin white paper to its website, joining a growing chorus of governments and companies now hosting bitcoin’s original blueprint. TAKEAWAY: A U.S. municipal government website is hosting the Bitcoin white paper. Let that sink in.

Over the past few months Grayscale Investments (owned by DCG, also parent of CoinDesk) has filed to register over 10 new trusts based on smaller cap crypto assets such as aave, chainlink, polkadot and others. TAKEAWAY: Grayscale currently manages a suite of market-leading trusts, including GBTC (bitcoin) and ETHE (ethereum), as well as some smaller ones based on horizen, litecoin, stellar and others. While Grayscale is not necessarily signaling intention to act on these new filings, they do hint at a growing breadth of choice for institutional investors in the months ahead.

Canadian investment firm Ninepoint Partners’ bitcoin fund (BITC.U and BITC.UN) started trading this week, having completed a C$230 million (US$180 million) initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange. TAKEAWAY: The considerable amount raised not only makes this Canada’s largest new crypto fund and the second in two months (the CI Galaxy Bitcoin Fund started trading on the TSX after a $72 million public raise in December), it also points to significant and growing demand from Canadian investors.

India’s parliament is considering a government-backed bill that would ban “private” cryptocurrencies and provide a framework for creating an official Reserve Bank of India digital currency. TAKEAWAY: The potential impact of the proposed bill is as yet unclear – for instance, what does it mean by “private” cryptocurrency? Bitcoin and others are public cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, this would set a worrying precedent. It would also be an interesting case study on how effective government bans of crypto assets are.

If you’re looking for some bird’s-eye perspective on monthly market performance, my colleague Shuai Hao put together this table of returns. If you squint, you can see that summer months are traditionally weaker, and the end of the year is usually stronger. Furthermore, we can see that volatility has declined a bit (fewer dark colors of either shade).","Bitcoin, BTC to USD, fell by 3.48% on Saturday. Reversing a 0.17% gain from Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week up by 2.51% to $33,138.0.

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning intraday high $34,407.0 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $35,238 Bitcoin fell to a late afternoon intraday low $32,228.0.

Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $33.136 and the 23.6% FIB of $33,008.

Finding late afternoon support, Bitcoin broke back through the 23.6% FIB and first major support level to end the day at $33,138.0.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the recent sell-off. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $18,504 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Sunday.

Ripple’s XRP rallied by 11.56% to lead the way, with Polkadot rising by 0.95% to also buck the trend.

It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors, however.

Crypto.com Coin slid by 6.35% to lead the way down.

Cardano’s ADA (-5.44%), Chainlink (-4.45%), and Ethereum (-4.79%) also saw relatively heavy losses.

Binance Coin (-1.00%), Bitcoin Cash SV (-0.55%), and Litecoin (-2.96%) saw relatively modest losses on the day.

It was also a mixed week for the crypto majors.

Ripple’s XRP surged by 81.2% to lead the way.

Binance Coin (+6.02%) also joined Bitcoin in the green.

It was a bearish week for the rest of the majors, however.

Crypto.com Coin and Polkadot slid by 14.74% and by 12.59% respectively to lead the way down.

Chainlink (-8.91%), Ethereum (-5.75%), and Litecoin (-8.21%) also struggled.

Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.33%) and Cardano’s ADA (-2.51%) saw relatively modest losses, however.

In the week, the crypto total market cap fell to a Wednesday low $847.51bn before rising to a Friday high $1,136.27bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $959.01bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Friday high 65.93% before falling to a Sunday low 62.40%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 63.19%.

Story continues

This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.71% to $32,570.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $33,125.0 before falling to a low $32,333.0

While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin fell through the 23.6% FIB of $33,008.

Elsewhere, it was a bearish start to the day.

At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 4.47% to lead the way down.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $33,008 and the pivot level at $33,258 to bring the first major resistance level at $34,287 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $34,000 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Sunday’s high $34,407.0 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $36,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $35,437.

Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB and the $33,258 pivot would bring the first major support level at $32,108 into play.

Barring an extended crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$31,000 levels. The second major support level at $31,079 should limit the downside.

More From FXEMPIRE:","Visa CEO Says Payments Giant Set to Introduce Cryptocurrency Trading on Its Network

Payments giant Visa Inc’s CEO Alfred Kelly has revealed his firm’s plans to enable cryptocurrencies trading on its network. Kelly, who is also chairman of the firm, explains that there is no reason not to add cryptos when these are increasingly becoming “a recognized means of exchange.”

Digital Gold Segment

In an earnings call with analysts, Kelly opines that due to Visa’s “global presence, its partnership approach as well as its trusted brand”, the fintech giant is “uniquely positioned to help make cryptocurrencies more safe.” The CEO adds that Visa also wants to make cryptos “more useful and applicable for payments.”

However, to achieve this, Kelly says his organization will divide the crypto market into two segments, namely cryptocurrencies and digital currencies. Describing the assets that will be included in the cryptocurrency segment, the CEO says these will be viewed “as digital gold.” According to Kelly, such currencies are “predominantly held as assets that are not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point.” The Visa boss then discusses the firm’s plan for such currencies saying:

Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials or to cash out onto a Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa’s accepted globally.

According to Kelly, this strategy will be similar to Visa’s approach to “connect closed-loop wallets such as Line Pay and Paytm.”

Digital Currency Segment

Concerning digital currencies that will feature in the second segment, the Visa CEO says these will be consist of “fiat-backed digital currencies including stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.” He adds that these emerging payments innovations can potentially be “used for global commerce much like any other fiat currency.”

Meanwhile, the Visa CEO reveals some of the 35 organizations that have already chosen to issue Visa cards. These include leading digital currency platforms and wallets providers like “crypto.com, Blockfi, Fold, and Bitpanda.” According to Kelly, these wallet relationships “represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials.”

The benchmark S&P 500 finished up by 16%, which is nearly double the index's average annual return over the past 40 years. But this gain pales in comparison to what bitcoin has been able to deliver for its investors.

Last year, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap more than quadrupled. Meanwhile, over the trailing five-year period, it's gained better than 8,200%. Investors would struggle to find a public company with more robust returns over the past half-decade.

There are smart ways to play the bitcoin craze

Investors' love for bitcoin has also spilled over into equities. There are more than a dozen publicly traded stocks that are in some way affiliated with bitcoin -- and some of these businesses look downright intriguing.

For example, payments platform Square (NYSE:SQ) has received a healthy revenue boost thanks to bitcoin exchange and investment via Cash App. This peer-to-peer payment platform has seen its monthly active user count more than quadruple since the end of 2017, and it's proven especially popular with millennials and Generation Z. Square has placed about 1% of its total assets ($50 million, at the time) into bitcoin tokens.

Tech stock NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also been a clear winner from bitcoin euphoria. Among its many products, NVIDIA sells graphics processing units used by cryptocurrency miners. These miners use high-powered computers to solve complex mathematical equations that validate the accuracy of transactions on bitcoin's blockchain network.

The most dangerous bitcoin stocks

But there are also more than a handful of bitcoin stocks that look downright dangerous. Investors would be wise to avoid these cryptocurrency stocks like the plague.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust

The fact is that not everyone who wants to buy bitcoin feels comfortable doing so from a cryptocurrency exchange. Further, the Securities and Exchange Commission hasn't given the green light for the creation of bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Thus, one of the few ways to gain bitcoin exposure without directly buying bitcoin is with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC).

In easy-to-understand terms, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust purchases and holds bitcoin tokens. It updates its token count pretty regularly, making it easy for current and prospective investors to calculate an accurate net asset value (NAV) for what's on the books, so to speak. Unfortunately, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has two key drawbacks.

First of all, it typically trades at a substantial premium to its NAV. As of Jan. 26, it held 647,288 bitcoin tokens. Based on a valuation of $32,175 per bitcoin, this is a NAV of $20.83 billion. However, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust closed on Jan. 26 with a value of $21.48 billion. Believe it or not, this is actually one of the smallest premiums I've seen in the years I've followed this bitcoin basket-holding security. It's not uncommon for it to be valued between 20% and 40% above its NAV, which is highly dangerous for unsuspecting investors.

The second issue is that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust charges a ridiculously high 2% management fee for doing close to nothing. Its management team acquires bitcoin tokens from time to time and cold-stores them with Coinbase. How that necessitates to a 2% fee is beyond me.

Riot Blockchain

While having a stake in the companies that sell bitcoin mining equipment is a potentially smart way to play the bitcoin craze, owning stocks that actually do bitcoin mining is not. That's why small-cap highflier Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) is such a dangerous investment.

One of the prime concerns with mining companies is that they're almost entirely reliant on the performance of bitcoin, rather than on innovation. Since bitcoin miners receive block rewards of 6.25 tokens (worth about $201,000) for validating transactions, they need a continually euphoric bitcoin market to make this highly capital-intensive operating model worthwhile. It also doesn't help that halving events every few years reduce the amount of reward paid out per block. It's a highly competitive and decreasing return game that produces few winners.

How has Riot Blockchain done, you ask? Although its stock has catapulted higher by more than 1,500%, the company has only managed $6.7 million in revenue through the first nine months of 2020. It's also lost $16.6 million through the first nine months of back-to-back years (2019 and 2020). That's a $1.3 billion valuation for a company that may not even reach $10 million in annual sales and doesn't look to be anywhere near recurring profitability.

Long story short, Riot Blockchain is an awful bitcoin stock to buy.

MicroStrategy

Another bad-news bitcoin stock that's been caught in the euphoria is enterprise analytics company MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR).

The reason MicroStrategy has created so much buzz is because it's piled all of its unneeded balance sheet cash into bitcoin. In fact, the company issued $650 million in debt just so it could acquire additional bitcoin. This greater than $1.1 billion investment yielded 70,470 tokens at an average price of $15,964. Sort of like Grayscale, buying MicroStrategy gives investors a way to ride bitcoin's ebbs and flows without actually having to buy the token.

What makes MicroStrategy such a dangerous investment is threefold. First, bitcoin is itself a highly volatile and dangerous investment. As I've previously argued, it lacks true scarcity, has minimal utility, and could be easily replaced. It also has a penchant for entering long bear markets after parabolic moves higher. It doesn't seem like a prudent asset for a public company to store their cash.

Secondly, MicroStrategy borrowed money to buy bitcoin, which is twice as egregious as simply putting its existing cash in a highly volatile asset. Though this strategy has paid off momentarily, it's far from certain that this'll be a wise move.

Third, MicroStrategy's actual business operations aren't that exciting. Its sales through three-quarters of 2020 are down 1%, and its operating loss widened by $3.4 million from the prior-year nine-month period to $14 million. Rather than focusing on the company's operations, CEO Michael Saylor looks to be crossing his fingers and hoping for the best with an investment that's out of his control.

Bit Digital

Have I mentioned that buying bitcoin mining stocks isn't a good idea? If you happened to have skimmed past the section on Riot Blockchain, here's a potentially even more dangerous mining stock: Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT).

Over the trailing year, Bit Digital is the top-performing equity listed on the major U.S. exchanges. It's gained just a hair over 3,500%, even after being halved following its intraday high of $33 in early January. You'd think a company that's up 3,500% over the past year would have a compelling investment story, but this just isn't the case.

Like Riot Blockchain, the downside for a mining company like Bit Digital is that it's almost entirely reliant on bitcoin tokens outperforming. It's pricey to buy and operate crypto mining equipment. If bitcoin were to enter a sustained bear market, which it's done multiple times over the past decade, Bit Digital could struggle.

What makes Bit Digital even scarier than Riot is the fact that it's a foreign issuer. As noted in the company's response to fraud accusations two weeks ago, ""[T]he Company as a foreign issuer is not required under home country practice to publicly announce its quarterly results."" I don't know about you, but this is a gigantic red flag. Even though Bit Digital did share its three- and nine-month results, there's no guarantee that it's going to continue to do so.

Plus, for what it's worth, the company lost nearly $4.6 million over the first nine months of 2020, and even with bitcoin soaring in the latest quarter managed a profit of only $54. That's not millions or thousands, by the way. That's $54 -- like the change in your wallet. How this company is worth close to $850 million is mind-boggling.","Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- The surprise takeover bid for Toshiba Corp. is a palpable demonstration of the growing influence in corporate Japan of activist investors, who have gone from largely impotent onlookers to kingmakers in the space of just a few years.The offer from CVC Capital Partners, while still in the early stages, comes just weeks after Toshiba Chief Executive Officer Nobuaki Kurumatani lost a landmark shareholder vote, forcing an independent investigation into alleged issues with voting at its annual general meeting last year.That loss has piled pressure on Kurumatani, who barely won re-election at last year’s meeting and is seen as unlikely to survive another. The vote was triggered by Toshiba’s largest shareholder, the secretive Singapore-based hedge fund Effissimo Capital Management.Any deal for Toshiba faces legal hurdles, and analysts say that investors such as Effissimo would likely insist on a substantial premium from Tuesday’s closing price. But the episode shows that the influence of activism in Japan is becoming hard to deny.“There have been false dawns before,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “But activism is taking hold now.”Flexing MusclesCVC offered about 5,000 yen per share in its buyout proposal, according to a Toshiba executive. A bid at that level would value Toshiba at about 2.28 trillion yen ($20.7 billion) and represent a 31% premium to its last close before news of the bid emerged, data compiled by Bloomberg show.That would make it the largest private equity-led buyout since 2013, and CVC’s biggest acquisition on record. Toshiba’s board plans to form a special committee to consider the proposal, said the executive, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.While there are many hurdles to a deal taking place, Toshiba shares rose by their daily limit of 18% to 4,530 yen per share at the close in Tokyo.“Considerable value would be created simply by simplifying ownership and clarifying governance by taking the company private,” said Nicholas Benes, an expert on Japanese corporate governance. “Precisely because of that, one would very much hope that this is a case where Toshiba will be open to other bids, by both other PE firms as well as strategic acquirers.”Activist investors have increasingly been flexing their muscle in Japan in recent years, as corporate governance reforms promoting shareholder value have meant management can no longer dismiss such pressure. Tokyo Dome Corp. will be delisted this month after acquisition by a white knight last year to fend off pressure from activist investor Oasis Management Co.Once a storied name in Japan, Toshiba has faded dramatically since its glory days after years of management missteps and scandal. The conglomerate invented flash memory three decades ago, but it was forced to sell most of its prized chip business in 2018 because of losses in its nuclear-power operation. That deal led to an infusion of cash -- but also a large contingent of more vocal shareholders. Last week, Singapore fund 3D Investment Partners became the latest investor to say it may make make proposals to management, boosting its stake to more than 7%.“Any successes of this nature will probably snowball and lead to more activity,” said Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “There is a sense that a large part of Japan’s industrial base is being run inefficiently, resulting in apparent undervaluation of Japanese conglomerates.”Kioxia OptionsOne open question for Toshiba is the future of Kioxia Holdings Corp., its former memory-chip division in which its still holds the biggest stake. Kioxia is focused on going public as soon as this summer in an IPO that could value the business at more than $36 billion, Bloomberg News reported last week. Alternatively, Micron Technology Inc. and Western Digital Corp. are each to be interested in acquiring the firm, the Wall Street Journal reported.If Toshiba secures a reasonable market valuation for Kioxia, and its core businesses attract multiples similar to those of its Japan peers, Thong said he sees scope for over 1 trillion yen of shareholder value creation. That would imply a Toshiba share price of over 6,500 yen per share, while the deal reported by the Nikkei sets the price at about 5,000 yen apiece.Mio Kato of LightStream Research sees a low possibility of the deal going through under current terms, and expects volatile trading for Toshiba’s shares in the near term depending on how things develop. Toshiba’s shareholders, especially activists, will want a rather “steep price,” he wrote in a note published on SmartKarma.Given the sensitivity around several of Toshiba’s bushinesses, including its deep involvement in decommissioning the wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, government approval would be required for the deal, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Wednesday.It’s unclear if a foreign firm such as CVC would be allowed to take control of Toshiba. The relationship between CVC and Toshiba executives -- with Kurumatani a former Japan president and external director Yoshiaki Fujimori still employed by the firm -- has also raised eyebrows.“This could simply be an attempt to buy time for Kurumatani,” Kato said.(Updates with details of bid level from sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","UBS: Crypto Has Fundamental Flaw, Bitcoin's Fixed Supply Could Cause Its Value to Collapse

A chief economist at UBS, the largest bank in Switzerland, says cryptocurrency has a fundamental flaw. Bitcoin’s fixed supply could cause the collapse of its value and spending power, making it unattractive to use as a currency, he claims.

A UBS Chief Economist Says Bitcoin’s Fixed Supply Is a ‘Fundamental Flaw’

Paul Donovan, Chief Economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, explained last week why people won’t want to use bitcoin as a currency. UBS is the largest bank in Switzerland.

“The debate about bitcoin and other crypto tends to be very passionate. Crypto supporters say that economists are just dinosaurs, and economists say that crypto supporters are just selling a bubble.” He also pointed out that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been volatile in price terms.

“If we look objectively at the issue, I think an important question is whether bitcoin and other crypto could be currencies,” the UBS chief economist continued, emphasizing, “And, I don’t think that they can.”

He explained that “One of the key reasons for that is that a currency has to be a stable store of value. With a proper currency, you got a genuine certainty that the basket of goods you can buy today is going to be the same as the basket of goods that you can buy tomorrow.”

However, he asserted that “With bitcoin and other crypto, you don’t have that certainty.” The UBS chief economist explained:

It’s all down to a rather fundamental flaw with crypto. In order to achieve stable spending power, a store of value, the balance of supply and demand needs to be maintained.

“So, if demand for proper currency goes down, the central bank can reduce supply, maintaining the balance and therefore maintaining spending power,” the UBS chief economist opined. However, he did not differentiate between cryptocurrencies with a fixed supply, like bitcoin, and other coins without a fixed supply, including stablecoins.

Donovan continued:

But if demand for crypto goes down, and self-evidently it does, the supply cannot go down to maintain balance. So, the value, and the spending power, immediately collapses.

“It might collapse for a short period of time or it might collapse for a long period of time. But people are unlikely to want to use something as a currency if they got absolutely no certainty about what they can buy with that tomorrow,” he concluded.

Many financial strategists, on the other hand, have said that bitcoin’s volatility falls as adoption increases. Fidelity recently pointed out that BTC’s volatility is down about 50% from a few years ago. In July, BTC’s volatility hit a three-year low. Billionaire investor Bill Miller said bitcoin becomes less risky the higher the price goes.

UBS recently published guidance on bitcoin investing. “While we wouldn’t rule out further price increases,” the bank warned: “We are also cognizant of the real risk of one losing one’s entire investment. Investors in cryptocurrencies must therefore limit the size of their investments to an amount they can afford to lose.”

Crypto Broker AG is part of a digital assets conglomerate that includes asset management and storage infrastructure services. The license means broadening the scope of its business and adding a rubber stamp when it comes to compliance, risk monitoring, liquidity reporting and so on, said Crypto Broker CEO Rupertus Rothenhaeuser.

“Some of our client banks have strict orders only to trade with regulated partners,” Rothenhaeuser said in an interview. “Now it’s just a case of calling them up to tick a box and they can start trading.”

Swiss momentum

Switzerland is probably the only place on the planet where regulations are actually keeping up with crypto infrastructure. That said, only a handful of crypto firms have been given FINMA’s blessing.

The securities license invites Crypto Broker AG to join other regulated Swiss crypto players like SEBA and Sygnum, and dive into the world of regulated security tokens (an area that just received further clarity in Switzerland thanks to the so-called “super DLT law”).

In terms of immediate practicalities, being a licensed broker allows the firm to hold funds in fiat currency for clients, which removes headaches around payments and processing, said Rothenhaeuser.

“On the one side, we are very much a modern, fast, DLT-based business. But on the other side, the payment cycle for cryptocurrency transactions reminds me sometimes of being back in the 1980s,” Rothenhaeuser said. “Being a securities license holder enables us to keep funds in the account rather than always keep the balance zero, so we can do much better straight through processing and also maximize our margins.”

BTC.BS=-USS

It has been a volatile few months for bitcoin. On Friday alone, the cryptocurrency briefly shot 20% higher after billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to ""#bitcoin."" Though it quickly gave up those gains, there are parallels between bitcoin's swift move higher and the GameStop stock mania, which continues to dominate the global news cycle. The battle of hedge-fund short sellers versus retail traders who are coordinating on social media to drive the price higher could be a sign of what's to come for the world's biggest cryptocurrency.

Shorting bitcoin

Data from crypto news and analysis company The Block shows that hedge funds are short bitcoin by more than $1 billion. That term ""shorting"" means that traders and hedge funds are betting that the price of bitcoin will go down. Those short positions ramped up starting in October 2020, just as bitcoin's latest rally began to take hold. Meanwhile, individual investors are still buying into bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies, as they bet that the price will go up. Sound familiar? Retail brokerages including Robinhood have extended trading restrictions on stocks such as GameStop, and as of Friday, the trading app is also limiting trading in cryptocurrencies.

Crypto fundamentals

Unlike GameStop, a brick-and-mortar mall business that was closing stores even before the pandemic led to widespread shutdowns, analysts say the fundamentals underlying bitcoin tell a more promising story. Analysts at JPMorgan think the price of bitcoin could rally as high as $146,000, and the global head of CitiFXTechnicals says the charts signal that bitcoin could reach $318,000 by December. Part of what's different about bitcoin's rally in 2020 versus its last run higher, in 2017, is that institutional investors are now adopting bitcoin, lending it newfound legitimacy and helping to erase the reputational risk of investing in the cryptocurrency.

""We've seen the majority of folks like insurance firms, asset managers, hedge funds and corporate balance sheets come into the market in 2020,"" said Michael Bucella, general partner at crypto firm BlockTower Capital. The surge in interest from mainstream financial players hasn't just reformed bitcoin's image, it's also fomented a supply shortage.

Bitcoin's supply crisis

""There is a large and emerging group of institutions that have an enormous capital base that are reallocating to this space,"" Bucella said. ""And if you think about the supply-demand model of a commodity, the supply curve is declining over time to effectively zero, and the demand is increasing exponentially."" There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, because, like other cryptocurrencies, it was built around the principle of a finite supply. The total number of mined bitcoin is at roughly 18.6 million, so it's nearing its maximum threshold. And that interest from institutional investors doesn't appear to be slowing down. ""There's a lot of demand, and there's not enough supply of bitcoin for every financial institution to have their own reserve to serve their clients,"" said McKenzie Slaughter, a member of the Black Women Blockchain Council.

Bitcoin vs. GameStop","Just days after Elon Musk added #bitcoin to his Twitter bio, a move that caused the price of the cryptocurrency to briefly surge around 20% on Friday, the Tesla boss confirmed that he is a supporter of bitcoin.

“I do at this point think bitcoin is a good thing, and I am a supporter of bitcoin,” Musk said when asked about his thoughts on cryptocurrencies during a live-streamed interview on the popular audio chat app Club House on Sunday. “Many friends of mine have tried to convince me to get involved in bitcoin for a long time.”

Musk added. “I think bitcoin is really on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people.”

Musk explained that one friend offered him a slice of ""bitcoin cake"" in 2013.

""I mean I clearly should have at least bought some bitcoin eight years ago,"" Musk said, noting he has been late to the party on bitcoin.

The value of the cryptocurrency traded above the $33,000 level on Monday evening after hitting an all-time high of $42,000 at the beginning of 2021.

To Musk's point, large institutions including Mass Mutual and PayPal recently disclosed acceptance of the digital currency.

BITCOIN SHEDS BAD BOY IMAGE

When asked about other forms of cryptocurrency, Musk admitted that he doesn't have any ""strong opinion."" However, the billionaire has previously tweeted about Dogecoin, including a 2019 tweet in which he referred to it as his “fav cryptocurrency.”

“Occasionally I make jokes about dogecoin but they are really just meant to be jokes. “Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies,” Musk said. “But fate loves irony. The most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth in the future.”

Sure, Elon Musk’s long-awaited endorsement failed to move bitcoin much, but then, he doesn’t have a three-inch tongue or batwings, does he?

In a pair of tweets in the wee morning hours, the KISS frontman tweeted out: “I’m not recommending any of this to anyone. But yes, I bought and/or will own Bitcoin, Etherium, Litecoin and others.”

I’m not recommending any of this to anyone. But yes, I bought and/or will own Bitcoin, Etherium, Litecoin and others. — Gene Simmons (@genesimmons) February 1, 2021

Which was followed 45 minutes later by: “Not recommending any of these to anyone. But yes, I also bought Dogecoin, XRP and others. Make of it what you will.”

Not recommending any of these to anyone. But yes, I also bought Dogecoin, XRP and others. Make of it what you will. — Gene Simmons (@genesimmons) February 1, 2021

But, will he move the market?

Well, were not saying there was a Simmons spike but XRP—already on its way up from $0.26 thanks to Reddit’s hedge fund-killing WallStreetBets subreddit—was at about $0.41 shortly after midnight on Feb. 1, when Simmons tweeted. It then climbed to $0.74 over the next six hours, according to CoinMarketCap, before falling back to $0.42 at press time.

But BTC, ETH and LTC were all flat.

However, Dogecoin also had a bump this morning. So, at the very least, Simmons’ timing is good when it comes to altcoins.

Simmons has expressed interest in bitcoin and in cryptocurrencies in general before, reaching back to the 2017 boom when he told TheStreet that cryptocurrencies could have a place in a diversified investment portfolio.

He added—very casually—that he could be “talked into” a Kisscoin. Not that it ever happened, mind you.

More recently, he told American Songwriter in mid-January that cryptocurrency “is a game changer.” He said:

I’m in it big. I’ve done very well.”

Interestingly, he was not responding to a question about crypto, but simply what he was thinking about at the time.

Simmons also said—according to the interviewer—that he’s “deep in Bitcoin” as well as Zcash, Litecoin and “quite a few others.”

When asked why, Simmons told the publication:","Cryptocurrency markets can be “insanely volatile” in both directions, however, the recent market activity felt like “something else” with everyone’s favorite memecoin, DogeCoin (DOGE) surging nearly 10x in just 24 hours (breaking into the top 10 cryptos), Anthony Sassano from EthHub confirmed.

He also noted in the Daily Gwei that Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was created back in 2013 and has managed to survive up until this day by “harnessing the power of meme magic.”

Sassano reveals that he was actually active in the digital assets space when Dogecoin was first created during one of the first Bitcoin (BTC) bubbles of 2013/14. According to Sassano, the best part about all this back then was “the community,” because they were quite “friendly and welcoming.”

Sassano recalls that back then, they’d do things such as raise funds for a bobsled team, or even sponsor a Nascar driver and would often tip people in DOGE via different Internet forums. Sassano claims that these things were “a huge deal” at that time because crypto was still “a very nascent space and most people still thought Bitcoin was a scam (and Ethereum didn’t even exist yet) so Dogecoin was many people’s first ‘taste’ of crypto and for that it keeps a special place in many hearts to this day.”

Unfortunately, over the past few years. the Dogecoin community “evaporated and the coin became the target of many pump-and-dumps as there really is no fundamental value to DOGE,” Sassano claims.

He acknowledges that DOGE can be seen “moving” in its price chart and “every once in a while DOGE will quickly increase in price and then quickly dump again a short time later.” He pointed out that during these pump-and-dumps, many newer and uneducated crypto investors will lose a lot of funds because they bought the top and/or may engage in panic selling.

Sassano clarified that this doesn’t only happen with DOGE, but because of “the meme, charm, and wittiness of the cryptocurrency, it tends to lure many newer people in – not to mention that it has a very low unit price leading people to believe that they are buying it cheap’ because they don’t know what a market cap is.”

The above scenario is pretty much what played out on Thursday (January 28, 2021) with many people who are “completely new to crypto” purchasing DOGE through Robinhood (as it’s one of the handfuls of cryptos the stock trading platform currently supports). This led to “an extreme price rise in a very short amount of time and was honestly quite scary as it was giving me flashbacks to the end of the last bull market,” Sassano added.

DOGE was down around 30% only 24 hours after its massive pump, Sassano confirmed. This indicates that many people have lost money (for now at least). But everyone “needs a front door to discover this industry and that front door is usually speculating on various coins so there is a bright spot here,” Sassano claims.

He predicted:

“I think we’re about to see a massive wave of new people enter this ecosystem for the first time and my hope is that many of them find their way into the Ethereum and DeFi communities. We have so many awesome apps for them to use and it’d be a shame if they just stayed on centralized exchanges and speculated on random coins – let’s all work really hard to help these new people go bankless.”

Sassano isn’t the only one who believes that many new people will begin exploring digital asset investments and trading. Elon Musk, the Founder of Tesla and SpaceX and the world’s wealthiest person, recently noted that Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be “on the verge of getting broad acceptance” by traditional finance industry participants.

Musk, whose comments came during a recent Clubhouse chat session, stated:

“I think Bitcoin is really on the verge of getting broad acceptance by sort of the conventional finance people. I don’t have a strong opinion on other cryptocurrencies.”

Musk revealed that his friends tried to get him purchase Bitcoin before, however, he admitted that he’s “late to the party.” Musk also noted that he should have acquired some BTC back in 2013, which was when one of his friends had introduced the pseudonymous digital currency at that time.

Musk also discussed how he likes to make jokes about Dogecoin sometimes.

He added:","A California man was charged in a complaint unsealed today for his alleged participation in a coordinated cryptocurrency and securities fraud scheme that used purported digital currency platforms and foreign-based financial accounts.

John DeMarr, 55, of Santa Ana, was charged in a complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. DeMarr made his initial appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge John D. Early of the Central District of California. Judge Early referred the case to the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings.

“The indictment alleges an elaborate scheme in which the defendant conspired to lure unsuspecting investors with fraudulent promises of large returns in the cryptocurrency market, only to divert millions of dollars for his own personal use,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “While the technologies and methods are constantly changing, the Criminal Division’s commitment to aggressively pursuing fraud in all its forms remains unchanged.”

“As alleged, DeMarr made misrepresentations and false promises that coaxed investors into pouring millions of dollars into fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes, all to facilitate his extravagant lifestyle,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. “We will continue to root out and prosecute those who would cheat investors to line their own pockets.”

“Mr. DeMarr created an elaborate cryptocurrency scheme, complete with high profile endorsements and incredibly large returns that proved to be a mirage costing investors millions,” said Assistant Director in Charge Kristi K. Johnson of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “Mr. DeMarr is now in custody and no longer spending his victims' money, nor hiding from justice by faking his own disappearance.”

“In today’s hi-tech financial world there are increasingly more opportunities for fraudsters to take advantage of people and their bank accounts,” said Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner of the IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Los Angeles Field Office. “John DeMarr’s Bitcoin operation is one such example of a cryptocurrency investment scheme that did not payoff for his investors. Claiming to be part of a cryptocurrency ‘ecosystem,’ DeMarr created nothing more than an elaborate fraud scheme where he stole his investors’ money to fund his own personal lifestyle, resulting in losses totaling over $11 million. Financial crimes never pay, as one way or another the person behind the computer will be caught and will be held accountable.”

As alleged in the complaint, between 2017 and 2018, DeMarr conspired with others to defraud numerous victims of $11.4 million by inducing them to invest in their companies, “Start Options” and “B2G,” based on materially false and misleading representations. Start Options purported to be an online investment platform that provided cryptocurrency mining, trading, and digital asset trading services. B2G was purportedly an “ecosystem” that would allow users to trade B2G tokens, provide digital wallet staking, and trade digital and fiat currencies “on a secure, comprehensive platform.”

According to the allegations, however, both Start Options and B2G were fraudulent. In approximately December 2017, DeMarr and others began offering securities in the form of investment contracts to U.S. and international investors through the Start Options website. Investments were accepted in Bitcoin, U.S. dollars, or Euros. To participate, investors had to deposit their funds for a specified contract period, after which they could purportedly withdraw their money at a significant profit.

Among other things, DeMarr and others falsely claimed that investor funds would be invested in digital asset mining and trading platforms that would earn them massive profits. In truth, however, the money was never invested and was instead diverted to accounts controlled by DeMarr and others and used for various personal expenditures, including the purchase of a Porsche, jewelry, and renovations to DeMarr’s home in California.

Similarly, according to the complaint, Start Options also purported to feature celebrity endorsements to promote its securities offerings. For example, a professional athlete purportedly endorsed Start Options when, as alleged in the indictment, the athlete had no involvement with Start Options and his name and likeness were used without his consent. Based on this and other fraudulent promotional materials, investors sent millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and fiat currency to financial accounts, including cryptowallets, controlled by DeMarr and others in the U.S. and abroad.

As alleged, in or about late January 2018, rather than permitting Start Options investors to withdraw money from their accounts after the requisite time period, DeMarr and others required investors to roll over their accounts into an unregistered “initial coin offering,” or ICO, of B2G, the second of the two fraudulent companies in which DeMarr was involved. Among other fraudulent misrepresentations, DeMarr and others falsely told investors that the ICO would raise capital for the company to build an “ecosystem” that would allow users to trade B2G tokens, provide digital wallet staking, and trading. In truth, investors never actually received any digital tokens and funds from the offering were not used to develop the B2G platform.

According to the complaint, DeMarr and others also paid various promoters, including an actor famous for martial arts films made in the 1980s and 1990s, to serve as a promoter and celebrity spokesperson, falsely claiming that B2G could generate an “8000%” return for investors within one year, and that he was a participant in the ICO. DeMarr and others also created false press releases and whitepapers about B2G, fabricated B2G account statements, and refused to allow investors to withdraw their money.

As alleged in the complaint, DeMarr staged his own disappearance to avoid facing disgruntled B2G investors. DeMarr instructed others to release statements asserting that DeMarr had been assaulted and went missing in Montenegro, and telling B2G investors to stop attempting to contact DeMarr or his family regarding their inability to have the money they invested in B2G returned. In truth, however, DeMarr did not disappear in Montenegro and instead was believed to be residing in California.

The charge in the complaint is based on allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

This case was investigated by the FBI and IRS-CI. Trial Attorney Kevin Lowell of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kaitlin Farrell, Hiral Mehta, and David Pitluck of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case, with assistance on forfeiture matters from Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Mantell.

The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section plays a pivotal role in the Department of Justice’s fight against white collar crime around the country.","Visa CEO Alfred Kelly says the card scheme is preparing its payments network to handle a full range of cryptocurrency assets.

In an earnings call with analysts, Kelly says the company will treat the crytocurrency market as two distinct segments: traditional cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and Ether; and fiat-backed digital currencies including stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.



""In this space, we see ways that we can add differentiated value to the ecosystem. And we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help make cryptocurrencies more safe, useful, and applicable for payments through our global presence, our partnership approach, and our trusted brand,"" Kelly told analysts.



For the first segment, Visa will work with ""wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials or to cash out onto a Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa’s accepted globally"".



This is similar to card scheme's to connect with closed loop wallets such as Line Pay and Paytm



Visa has already struck card deals with some 35 organisations in the crypto-markets, such as BitPanda and BlockFi. According to Kelly, these wallet relationships “represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials.”



Looking to the future, Visa will also train its focus on upcoming stablecoins that can be handled as a traditional and globally accepted mean of exchange, including bank-issued coins and central bank digital currencies.



""We think of digital currencies running on public blockchains as additional networks, just like RTP or ACH networks,"" says Kelly. ""But we see them as part of our network of network strategy.""



In December, Visa published a technical paper that outlines a novel approach for offline point-to-point payments between two devices, touting it as a means for central banks to replicate the physical exchange of cash using digital currencies.



Card rival Mastercard has also dipped its toe in the water, building a virtual testing platform to help central banks assess and explore national digital currencies.","FinCEN Extends Crypto Rule Comment Period, Crypto Payment Products Launch

By: Robert A. Musiala Jr.

This week the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a notice extending the comment period for its proposed rule that would impose new requirements on certain transactions involving convertible virtual currency or digital assets with legal tender status. The comment period has been extended to March 29, 2021.

In cryptocurrency payments news, according to a recent press release, a major U.S. nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating cancer has announced a partnership with The Giving Block, a cryptocurrency donations company, to launch a new cancer research project that will be exclusively funded with cryptocurrency donations. Separately, cryptocurrency exchange LVL has reportedly begun taking preorders for a new cryptocurrency debit card product issued in partnership with a major U.S. financial services firm. And two major cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken and eToro, recently published market reports with analysis of current trends in the cryptocurrency industry.

In a final notable item, earlier this month, reports found that someone transferred 74.6 million Synthetix Network Tokens (SNX), worth over $1 billion, on the Ethereum network through a contract called “Synthetix: Reward Escrow.” The transaction fee for the transfer was a mere $7.54. Synthetix is a decentralized finance protocol for trading asset-pegged synthetic tokens on Ethereum. This transaction is one of the largest single cryptocurrency transactions to date.

Enforcement Agencies Target Cryptocurrency Crimes in US, Japan and China

By: Joanna F. Wasick

A cryptocurrency trader, Jeremey Spence (aka Coin Signals), was recently charged in Manhattan federal court for running a Ponzi scheme involving more than $5 million and 170 victims. According to an announcement released this week by the U.S. Attorney, Spence solicited deposits for a number of cryptocurrency funds he operated by making false representations to investors, including that they would see 148% returns. In fact, Spence’s client accounts lost money, and Spence used new investor money to pay out earlier investors. Criminal charges have been brought by the U.S. Attorney, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has filed a separate federal civil enforcement action.

Earlier this week, Jerry Ji Guo was sentenced in a California federal court for conducting a fraud in which he represented himself as an initial coin offering consultant and promised his clients that he would perform marketing and publicity services for them. Instead of doing so, Guo embezzled his clients’ funds. Guo was ordered to pay over $4 million in restitution and was sentenced to six months in prison.

Also this week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a coordinated international law enforcement action to disrupt a sophisticated form of ransomware known as NetWalker. The action includes charges against a Canadian national in relation to the attacks, the seizure of over $400,000 in cryptocurrency from ransom payments and the disablement of a dark web communication resource.

Last week in Japan, about 30 people were charged with trading almost $100 million worth of cryptocurrency while knowing it was stolen off a Tokyo-based exchange three years ago. Japanese authorities allege the people were exchanging the cryptocurrency on a darknet marketplace. Separately, according to a recent report, a key executive from cryptocurrency exchange Huobi is currently in custody of Chinese police in relation to an investigation of the exchange’s over-the-counter trading service.

Shares of several companies with deep ties to the cryptocurrency market soared on Tuesday, Feb. 2. Cryptocurrency asset manager Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) gained as much as 10.1%, Chinese-American cryptocurrency mining expert Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ:MARA) reached a high of 11.6%, and Canadian crypto-mining company Hive Blockchain (OTC:HVBT.F) peaked at 12.3%. Data analytics specialist MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which has converted its long-term cash reserves into direct bitcoin holdings, also followed suit with a 6.8% gain as of 3 p.m. EST. The stocks are surging because many of the leading cryptocurrency tokens are on the rise today, which should translate into stronger financial results for all of these companies.

So what

Bitcoin prices are up by 5.6% in 24 hours, and Ethereum prices have gained 12.5% over the same period. Ripple stabilized after a wild weekend, and that token for cross-border transactions has now gained 42% in seven days. Other big names gaining more than 10% today include Ethereum competitor Cardano and the bitcoin alternative known as Litecoin.

Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatile price swings, often crashing or soaring for no particularly good reason. That's not the case today, because the blockchain-based sector actually has some solid news to share.

Index funds manager Bitwise Asset Management announced a new bitcoin fund, intended to provide an alternative to the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust OTC:GBTC) Fidelity NYSE:FNF)

The cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, managed by the Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame, is launching interest-bearing cryptocurrency accounts. Gemini's crypto savings account offers annual percentage yields (APY) of up to 7.4%, which is a generous interest rate next to the national average of less than 0.1%. If this type of cryptocurrency holding accounts becomes common, that could be a solid argument in favor of treating crypto tokens as serious currencies and/or investment assets.

fame, is launching interest-bearing cryptocurrency accounts. Gemini's crypto savings account offers annual percentage yields (APY) of up to 7.4%, which is a generous interest rate next to the national average of less than 0.1%. If this type of cryptocurrency holding accounts becomes common, that could be a solid argument in favor of treating crypto tokens as serious currencies and/or investment assets. MicroStrategy isn't done buying bitcoin quite yet. The company announced on Tuesday that it had acquired another 295 tokens worth $10 million in cash. The company now holds 71,079 bitcoin, worth $2.54 billion at current bitcoin prices. The original purchase price for this bitcoin reserve was approximately $1.15 billion. Larger corporations following MicroStrategy's lead to move a portion of their long-term investments into bitcoin and other crypto tokens could make a world of difference to the financial stability of these markets.

Now what

On top of all that, business magnate and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been supporting the not-so-serious Dogecoin token in a series of tweets recently, but last night he said that those were all jokes. In reality, Musk believes that ""bitcoin is a good thing"" and is a supporter of this specific token. He also said that bitcoin is ""on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people."" When the world's richest man speaks, markets react.

Nobody knows where bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies are going next, especially since governments around the world are still developing their legal and regulatory frameworks for handling these innovative but risky digital assets.

I happen to have a collection of various cryptocurrencies myself, all created from a very small bitcoin buy six years ago. So far, I see these tokens more as a fun experiment than a serious investment. That could change as the regulatory system develops and the cryptocurrency market crystallizes into something solid. For now, I'm happy to watch the crypto stocks above from the sidelines.","Gemini Trust, a New York-based cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, has begun offering a savings account to consumers.

The account, which is called Earn, lets clients move their holdings in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into interest-bearing accounts. The current rate is 7.4%.

Gemini, which is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services and has a money transmitter license in every state, can afford to pay such high rates because it lends the cryptocurrency to institutional borrowers through its lending partner, Genesis Global Capital.

“There's high demand for crypto among institutional borrowers,” Noah Perlman, chief operating officer of Gemini, said ahead of the company's announcement on Tuesday. “This is part of the maturation of the space. You have institutions who need to fund their operations and their own strategies, and as a result they're willing to pay competitive market rates to borrow.”

The new account is the type of “bridge” product cryptocurrency companies are building to try to disrupt and compete with traditional banks.

“We continue to see the creeping normalization of crypto by tailoring existing banking products to the extent possible,"" said Hans Morris, managing partner of NYCA Partners in New York. ""It will be something to watch if noncrypto holders are brought in by the offering of interest accounts.”

Perlman, who worked at Morgan Stanley for 13 years, says Earn is an appealing alternative to a basic checking account or savings account.

“You're always going to have maximalists, in any space,” he said. “And I wouldn't be surprised given the delta between the interest offered on a traditional banking account that you might have consumers who decide to take their entire savings and checking balance and move it to Gemini, to earn the compelling interest. But I would also suspect that you would have people who take a balanced approach. In the old method of putting together a portfolio, you'd have some mix of fixed income, equity and cash. Today investors are adding crypto to that mix.”

But because these accounts are tied to loans collateralized by bitcoin, they’re more akin to securities lending than to deposit banking, pointed out Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Avanti Bank in Wyoming.

“Interest rates on bitcoin loans are high because bitcoin has high price volatility and not much of it is available for lending,” she said. An estimated 75% to 80% of bitcoin is held in self-custody outside of intermediaries, she said.

“One issue with the bitcoin lending market is that no one knows whether the intermediaries are actually solvent,” Long said. “There’s no financial disclosure and almost no regulatory examination of intermediaries — and most of them are not audited either. So, it’s not possible to do counterparty credit risk analysis in this market. Caveat emptor.”

Added to that risk is the fact that the Earn account isn't insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or any other government program or institution.

In its account terms and conditions, Gemini warns that customers’ digital assets will leave Gemini’s custody, “and you accept the risk of loss associated with loan transactions, up to and including total loss of your available digital assets.”

Consumers may not care as much about deposit insurance as they used to, at least for short-term investments, said Brad Leimer, founder of the venture capital and advisory firm Unconventional Ventures in San Francisco.

“A decade and a half of low interest rates have taught a generation that the only way to get returns for savings and investments is to inherently assume added risk,” Leimer said. “Why not be more speculative with the limited funds we have to throw at something like Earn?”

Perlman said Gemini puts safety and security first.

When the cryptocurrency investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss started Gemini six years ago, their idea was to create a compliant, regulated, safe and secure platform for cryptocurrency holders to store and manage their digital assets, Perlman said.

“At the time it really was the Wild West in crypto,” Perlman said. Gemini started at around the same time the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox shut down after millions of bitcoin were stolen from it.

""That narrative has changed over time, although there are still a lot of people in traditional finance who cling to aspects of that narrative,"" Perlman said. ""Gemini is putting regulation first. We’ve always asked for permission, not forgiveness.”

Gemini also recently launched a credit card that accrues crypto rewards.

“The card goes hand in hand with the Earn product in the sense that these offerings further our mission of making crypto mainstream and providing a bridge from traditional finance products to a world of crypto,” Perlman said.

These products will appeal to early adopters and current Gemini customers first, Perlman said.

“Then they will start to attract what I call the crypto-curious and people who are thoughtful about finances, as crypto continues to get more and more mainstream,” he said.

Perlman is starting to see a convergence of crypto companies like Gemini and traditional banks.

“I do see a continued acceptance and recognition by traditional banking regulators and traditional financial institutions that crypto exchanges and platforms that take security regulation seriously are a growing part of the financial ecosystem,” Perlman said. “They will only grow in importance. And you see that in the approach that regulators now have. You see big, traditional public companies allocating some of their treasury to cryptocurrency, so traditional financial planners and banks can no longer ignore the space.”","A California man has been charged with securities fraud after allegedly tricking cryptocurrency investors out of millions and using actor Steven Seagal to promote a fake company.

John DeMarr, 55, of Santa Ana, was charged in a complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York. He is said to have conspired with others to defraud victims out of $11.4m by persuading them to invest in dud companies.

The complaint alleged that between 2017 and 2018, DeMarr and others made “false and misleading representations” about two companies: Start Options and B2G.

Start Options was promoted as an online investment platform offering cryptocurrency mining, trading and digital asset trading services. B2G was marketed to investors as an ecosystem that would allow users to trade B2G tokens, use digital wallets and trade digital and traditional currencies “on a secure, comprehensive platform.”

Investors were apparently told that their money would be held for a specified contract period, after which they could withdraw major profits.

In fact, the funds were redirected accounts controlled by DeMarr and others, who used the money to fund lavish purchases of luxury sports cars, jewellery and renovations to DeMarr’s Californian home, according to the Department of Justice (DoJ).

To catch the eye of investors, the co-conspirators are said to have invented celebrity endorsements for Start Options, including a professional athlete whose name and image was used without their permission.

When the end of a Start Options contract approached, they allegedly tried to persuade investors to roll over their accounts into an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for B2G.

Bizarrely, the scammers are reported to have recruited Steven Seagal, referred to in the DoJ release only as “an actor famous for martial arts films made in the 1980s and 1990s,” to promote B2G.

According to the DoJ, the co-conspirators falsely claimed that B2G could generate an 8000% return for investors within one year, and that Segal was a participant in the ICO. The actor is said to have moved on from the project in March 2018.

Incredibly, DeMarr then staged his own disappearance to avoid facing the wrath of angry investors, according to the complaint.

He’s said to have instructed others to release statements claiming that he had been assaulted and is now missing in Montenegro. However, all the while he’s believed to have been in California.

Seagal is reported to have settled with the FTC last year for his role in the ICO.","Crypto Asset Manager Bitwise Files to Publicly Trade Bitcoin Fund

On February 2, the crypto asset manager, Bitwise Asset Management, announced it had filed a Form 211 with the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). If the proposal is approved Bitwise will be able to deploy its shares publicly via over-the-counter (OTC) desks and secondary markets.

Bitwise Plans to Compete With Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust

The popular cryptocurrency index fund provider, Bitwise Asset Management, hopes to get regulatory approval from America’s financial regulators in order to publicly list the Bitwise Bitcoin Fund on OTC markets. The Bitwise Bitcoin Fund (BBF) if approved, will follow the public quotation of the firm’s Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund that recently obtained regulatory approval.

The BBF will trade on OTCQX Best Market and currently Bitwise hasn’t chosen a ticker for the fund yet. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro explained during the announcement that the fund has been managed since 2018 and the company looks forward to an OTCQX public quotation.

“We are tremendously excited to take the Bitwise Bitcoin Fund down the path recently taken by the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (OTCQX: BITW),” Fusaro said. “We have been managing this fund since 2018, offering investors a cost-effective, convenient, and secure means of gaining investment exposure to bitcoin, and are excited to potentially see shares of the fund quoted on OTCQX,” the crypto asset manager’s President added.

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer: ‘There Is Significant Growth in Interest From Professional Investors in Accessing Bitcoin’

The Bitwise Bitcoin Fund will compete with the likes of Grayscale, a fund manager that has created numerous trusts that are sold on OTC markets. Grayscale also has a fund that is similar to Bitwise’s 10 Crypto Index Fund called the Large Digital Cap Fund.

Both firms recently removed the crypto asset XRP from these two specific funds holding a basket of digital currencies. While Grayscale has had the opportunity to deploy the fund to a broader audience, Bitwise has had to keep the BBF strictly for private placements by accredited investors.

“There is significant growth in interest from professional investors in accessing bitcoin as a tool to hedge their portfolios against rising inflationary risks,” added Matt Hougan, Bitwise chief investment officer. “Financial advisors, in particular, are taking note of the large allocations that hedge funds, institutions, insurance companies, and traditional asset managers are making to bitcoin, and based on our recent survey of nearly 1,000 financial advisors, many are deciding that now is the time to consider an allocation of their own.”

Meanwhile, exchange-traded notes and trusts like Grayscale have been the only investment vehicles open to the public that give investors exposure to bitcoin and other digital assets. People are hoping the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2021.

A number of crypto proponents believe an ETF will be approved this year, as firms like Valkyrie Digital Assets and Vaneck are racing for approval.

Revealing the news exclusively to The Block on Tuesday, OKEx said the move is aimed at enabling cheaper and faster transactions for users.

Specifically, bitcoin deposits and withdrawals will get cheaper, said the exchange.

The current average cost of one bitcoin transaction is about $11, and its average confirmation time is between 10-30 minutes. ""This is impractical as more users join the network,"" OKEx CEO Jay Hao told The Block.

With Bitcoin's Lightning Network, a Layer-2 scaling solution, the average cost will come down to ""less than 0.01 cents,"" and the average confirmation time will reduce to ""1-3 seconds,"" said Hao.

That would be a huge benefit, but there are certain limitations of the Lightning Network. It is mainly meant for micro-transactions.

In other words, there is a cap on bitcoin withdrawals. ""For now, we are setting the limit at 0.000001 BTC to 0.05 BTC [$0.035 to $1,770],"" Hao told The Block.

For deposits, OKEx doesn't control the limit, ""but when you withdraw on another Lightning Network node to that deposit, that node will have similar limits,"" said Hao.

OKEx has partnered with Lightning Labs for the integration, meaning the exchange will become one of the nodes on the Lightning Network.

The network is made up of nodes to send and receive bitcoin from each other. These nodes open payment channels between them to increase the liquidity of the network. There are currently more than 8,600 nodes with payment channels, according to data from Bitcoin Visuals.

There is no specific date by when OKEx's integration with the network will be live, but Hao said it should be completed by March.

A number of crypto exchanges have announced support for the Lightning Network in recent weeks, including OKCoin and Kraken. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, and a few other exchanges already support the feature.","Introduction: Cryptocurrency-Trading Businesses in Canada

Canadian cryptocurrency-trading businesses face unique challenges. The mostly unregulated market brings higher risk of fraud and cyber-crime. The volatile markets may bleed profits. And some cryptocurrency traders don't even realize that they're carrying on a business, misreporting their profits as capital gains.

This article aims to educate cryptocurrency traders on a fundamental income-tax issue: calculating the costs of their cryptocurrency inventory for tax purposes. This article first discusses how Canada's tax system distinguishes a cryptocurrency-trading business, for which cryptocurrency is inventory, from a cryptocurrency investor, for whom cryptocurrency is a capital property. It then analyzes how a cryptocurrency-trading business should compute and claim its inventory costs for income-tax purposes. It concludes by offering pro tax tips for Canadian cryptocurrency-trading businesses.

Is Your Cryptocurrency Inventory? Trading vs. Investing

Canada's Income Tax Act recognizes only two broad sorts of property for tax purposes:

capital property, which creates a capital gain or loss upon disposition; and

inventory, which figures into the computation of business income.

The type of income that the property generates upon sale-that is, capital gains or business income-determines whether that property is a capital property or inventory. In other words, one starts by determining the nature of the income and then characterizes the property, not the other way around. Hence, your profits from a cryptocurrency transaction will be treated as either (i) business income or (ii) a capital gain, and, if they are characterized as business income, your cryptocurrency units constitute inventory.

The income/capital distinction also comes with important tax implications. The full amount of business or property income is taxable, while only one-half of a capital gain is taxable. On the flip side, while only one-half of capital losses are deductible, one may fully deduct losses and expenses associated with business or investment activity.

Some cryptocurrency transactions straddle the line between income and capital. Canadian courts have indeed churned out a large body of case law wrestling with the ambiguity between investing, which produces a capital gain or loss, and trading, which results in business income or expenses. Courts assess a wide range of factors when deciding whether to characterize a transaction's gains or losses as on an account of capital or income. Applied to cryptocurrency transactions, these factors may include:

transaction frequency-e.g., a history of extensive buying and selling of cryptocurrency or of a quick turnover of cryptocurrency units might suggest a business;

length of ownership-e.g., brief periods of holding the cryptocurrency indicate business dealings, not capital investing;

knowledge of cryptocurrency markets-e.g., increased knowledge of or experience with cryptocurrency markets favours a business characterization;

relationship to the taxpayer's other work-e.g., if cryptocurrency transactions (or similar dealings) form a part of a taxpayer's employment other business, it points toward business;

time spent-e.g., a greater likelihood of characterization as a business if a substantial part of the taxpayer's time is spent studying cryptocurrency markets and investigating potential purchases;

financing-e.g., leveraged cryptocurrency transactions indicate a business; and

advertising-e.g., increased likelihood of business characterization if the taxpayer has advertised or otherwise made it known that he deals in cryptocurrency.

Ultimately, the taxpayer's motive or intent at the time of acquiring the cryptocurrency is the most important criterion that courts consider when determining whether the transaction produced a capital gain or business income. Still, to discern a taxpayer's intention, courts will focus on the objective factors surrounding both the purchase and the sale of the cryptocurrency. In other words, courts will determine a taxpayer's intent by evaluating the factors listed above.

Computing & Claiming Costs of Cryptocurrency Inventory for Income-Tax Purposes

Subsection 9(1) of Canada's Income Tax Act codifies the deductibility of inventory costs by defining a taxpayer's business income as the taxpayer's ""profit from that business."" When evaluating how a taxpayer went about computing profit, a court may ask whether a particular deduction agrees with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). But for income-tax purposes, the determination of a taxpayer's profit is ultimately a legal question. In other words, while accounting principles and commercial practices may influence a court's determination of whether a deduction was proper, those norms don't comprise the operative legal criteria. In many cases, the Income Tax Act expressly ousts the use of otherwise acceptable accounting practices. So too have the courts.

That said, on the issue of computing inventory costs, Canada's income-tax law mainly defers to commercial practice and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For instance, commercial practice stipulates the use of accrual accounting for most businesses-especially those with high inventory turnover. As such, cryptocurrency-trading business will recognize inventory costs on an accrual basis, which means that the business doesn't deduct the cost of cryptocurrency as an expense for the fiscal period in which the cryptocurrency was purchased. Instead, the business recognizes the inventory cost as an expense for the fiscal period in which the cryptocurrency was sold (i.e., cost of goods sold). For any cryptocurrency remaining on hand at the end of the fiscal period, the inventory at cost is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet for that period.

Cryptocurrency-trading businesses typically feature substantial inventory turnover. Thus, it's neither possible nor desirable to keep a running tally of the cost of goods sold on a daily basis. So, the only feasible way of determining the cost of goods sold is to (i) determine the sum of the value of inventory on hand at the beginning of the tax year and the cost of the inventory purchased during the year and then (ii) subtract the value of the inventory on hand at the end of the year.

This accounting exercise gives us the following formula:

Cost of Goods Sold = Opening Inventory + Acquisitions - Closing Inventory

If inventory costs remain stable, the formula presents little trouble. If prices fluctuate, problems arise. For example: At the beginning of the year, a cryptocurrency-trading business has on hand 10,000 units of a particular coin with a current price of $1.00 per coin. At the end of the year, the business has on hand 10,000 units of the same coin with a current price of $4.00 per coin. During the year, the business traded 100,000 cryptocurrency units in the same coin, the price of which steadily increased as the business bought and sold cryptocurrency units each month. It's impossible to say whether the 10,000 units in closing inventory are the same units as those in the opening inventory, or whether some or none from the opening inventory remain.

Hence, the computation of cost of goods sold involves two steps: The first is valuation, the second tracing.

Inventory Valuation

Valuation refers to the method by which you assign an overall cost (or value) to the opening inventory and the closing inventory. Canada's Income Tax Act permits two general methods of valuing inventory:

valuation at the lower of cost and fair market value for each item of inventory; or

valuation of the entire inventory at fair market value.

A taxpayer may choose between these two methods and must use it consistently thereafter. (If the taxpayer wishes to switch, the Canada Revenue Agency must first give its permission.) Moreover, the Income Tax Act requires that the value of a business's opening inventory equal the value of the business's closing inventory from the immediately preceding year. So, the value of a taxpayer's closing inventory determines the value of the taxpayer's opening inventory for the following year.

Inventory Tracing

Tracing refers to the method by which you determine which goods comprise the closing inventory and how much those goods cost. Canada's income-tax law permits two methods of tracing: (1) averaging and (2) first in, first out (FIFO). Averaging assumes that the cost of each unit in closing inventory and of goods sold during the year equals the average cost of all units in opening inventory and of all units purchased during the year. FIFO allocates the most recent costs to closing inventory and the oldest costs to goods sold during the year. The assumption is that the goods sold were those first purchased-hence, first in, first out.

A third tracing GAAP method-last in, first out (LIFO)-also exists. LIFO makes the opposite assumption as that made by FIFO, and it thus allocates the oldest costs to closing inventory and the most recent costs to goods sold during the year. Canadian courts have rejected its legitimacy, however. Thus, Canadian cryptocurrency-trading businesses cannot use LIFO for income-tax purposes. This is an example of Canada's income-tax law expressly ousting the use of otherwise acceptable accounting practices.

Pro Tax Tips: Record-Keeping, Cryptocurrency Tax Audits, Voluntary Disclosures Program & Solicitor-Client Privilege

A cryptocurrency-trading business that lacks proper records will fare poorly during a CRA cryptocurrency tax audit. If selected for a cryptocurrency tax audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, a Canadian cryptocurrency trader will typically receive a 13-page cryptocurrency-audit questionnaire, which includes over 50 questions on a range of topics, such as:

The timeline of owing or using cryptocurrency;

The source of the cryptocurrencies purchased;

The use of third-party exchange wallets;

The source of funds used to purchase cryptocurrency;

Transaction record-keeping practices of the taxpayer;

Participation in initial coin offerings (ICOs);

Whether any cryptocurrency holdings generate passive income for the taxpayer (e.g., Node, Masternodes, Supernodes, etc.);

Participation in cryptocurrency mining (including questions about the sort of mining hardware used and energy expenses related to mining);

Acceptance of cryptocurrency as payment for goods or services;

The frequency of cryptocurrency transactions; and

The time spent studying cryptocurrency markets.

The taxpayer must also turn over bank-account statements and any other records allowing the Canada Revenue Agency's tax auditor to verify the taxpayer's answers.

Cryptocurrency traders must therefore keep records of their cryptocurrency transactions. If you use a cryptocurrency exchange, you should periodically export your transaction information to avoid losing it. (Many cryptocurrency traders found themselves suddenly without any records when the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX imploded.) You should also maintain the following records about your cryptocurrency transactions:

The date of each transaction;

Any receipts for purchasing or transferring cryptocurrency;

The value of the cryptocurrency in Canadian dollars at the time of the transaction;

The digital-wallet records and cryptocurrency addresses;

A description of the transaction and of the other party (e.g., the other party's cryptocurrency address);

The exchange records;

Records relating to any accounting and legal costs; and

Records relating to any software costs for managing your tax affairs.

If you mine cryptocurrency, you should keep the following records in addition to your cryptocurrency-transaction records:

Receipts for purchasing cryptocurrency-mining hardware;

Receipts for expenses associated with your cryptocurrency-mining operation (e.g., power costs, mining-pool fees, maintenance costs);

Records about your cryptocurrency-mining operation (e.g., hardware specifications, hardware operation time); and

The mining pool details and records.

Our Certified Specialist Canadian tax lawyer can provide advice about record-keeping and proper reporting of your cryptocurrency profits to ensure that CRA doesn't fault you for misrepresenting the information in your tax returns. You may, for example, benefit from a tax memorandum examining whether your cryptocurrency profits should be reported as capital gains or as business income or as a blend of both. It is also important to remember that an intermediate transaction-e.g., purchasing Bitcoin for the sole purpose of acquiring a trading pair-may itself give rise to a taxable transaction.

Since forming an international coalition aimed at cryptocurrency transactions, the Canada Revenue Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, and other tax administrators have fine-tuned the strategies allowing them to identify cryptocurrency users for tax audit or prosecute them for tax evasion. The advances and cooperative efforts of tax authorities signal the end of the anonymity that cryptocurrency users thought they once enjoyed. This should definitely concern Canadian taxpayers with unreported profits from cryptocurrency transactions. If you filed tax returns that omitted or underreported your cryptocurrency profits, you risk facing not only civil monetary penalties, such as gross-negligence penalties, but also criminal liability for tax evasion.

You may qualify for relief under the CRA's Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP). If your VDP application qualifies, the CRA will renounce criminal prosecution and waive gross-negligence penalties (and may reduce interest). A voluntary-disclosure application is time-sensitive, however. The CRA's Voluntary Disclosures Program will reject an application-and thus deny any relief-unless the application is ""voluntary."" This essentially means that the VDP must receive your voluntary-disclosure application before the CRA contacts you about the non-compliance you sought to disclose. Our experienced Canadian tax lawyers have dealt with many Canadian taxpayers involved with cryptocurrency and can carefully plan and promptly prepare your voluntary-disclosure application. A properly prepared disclosure application not only increases the odds that the CRA will accept your disclosure but also lays the groundwork for a judicial-review application to the Federal Court should the CRA unfairly deny your disclosure.

To determine whether you qualify for the Voluntary Disclosures Program, schedule a confidential and privileged consultation with one of our expert Canadian tax lawyers. The Canada Revenue Agency cannot compel the production of information protected by solicitor-client privilege. In other words, solicitor-client privilege prevents the CRA from learning about the legal advice that you received from your tax lawyer. Your communications with an accountant, however, remain unprotected unless the accountant has been retained on your behalf by a Canadian tax lawyer. So, if you seek tax advice but want to keep that information away from the CRA, you should approach a Canadian tax lawyer first. If an accountant is needed, your Canadian tax lawyer will retain the accountant on your behalf and extend the privilege.

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning intraday low $33,500.0 before making a move.

Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $33,008 and the first major support level at $32,364, Bitcoin rallied to a late intraday high $36,054.0.

Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $34,738 and the second major resistance level at $35,909.

A late pullback, however, saw Bitcoin fall back through the second major resistance level to end the day at sub-$35,600 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the recent pullback to sub-$40,000. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $18,504 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Tuesday.

Binance Coin (-0.78%) and Polkadot (-1.27%) saw red to buck the trend on the day.

It was a bullish day for the rest of the majors, however.

Ethereum jumped by 10.12% to lead the way, with Litecoin rallying by 7.65%.

Bitcoin Cash SV (+3.13%), Cardano’s ADA (+4.11%), Chainlink (+3.49%), and Crypto.com Coin (+4.01%) also found strong support.

Ripple’s XRP (+0.34%) trailed the front runners, however.

At the start of the week, the crypto total market cap fell to a Monday low $939.07bn before rising to a Tuesday high $1,080.74bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $1,066.34bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance fell to a Monday low 61.48% before rising to a Monday high 64.10%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 63.12%.

This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.73% to $36,192.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning low $35,485.0 before rising to a high $36,305.1

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the broader market.

Story continues

Cardano’s ADA (-0.44%), Chainlink (-0.14%), and Polkadot (-1.23%) saw red early on to buck the trend.

It was a bullish start for the rest of the majors, however.

At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 5.25% to lead the way.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall through the pivot level at $35,044 to bring the first major resistance level at $36,587 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from this morning’s high $36,305.1.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $37,000 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $38,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $37,598.

Failure to avoid a fall through the $35,044 pivot would bring the first major support level at $34,033 into play.

Barring an extended crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$34,000 levels and the 23.6% FIB of $33,008. The second major support level sits at $32,490.

The balance of dollar-pegged USDC on exchanges reached over $915 million Friday, while the amount of decentralized stablecoin dai on exchanges went above $81 million on Sunday, according to Glassnode.

USDC on exchanges “represents almost $1 billion worth of buying power from USDC alone, poised to move into assets” such as bitcoin, according to Glassnode’s weekly newsletter dated Feb 1. “This high figure should increase investors’ confidence in any dips being quickly bought up, making it a bullish signal.”

As CoinDesk reported Tuesday, some analysts see several on-chain metrics for bitcoin’s price pointing in a bullish direction in the coming weeks. For example, a decreased amount of bitcoin held on exchange addresses indicates less pressure on the sell side.

In crypto trading, traders and investors often use stablecoins to put money into riskier cryptocurrencies; in such cases, buying stablecoins backed by government-issued currencies is seen as the first step necessary before buying other cryptocurrencies.

“The growth in on-exchange USDC reflects the increasing view among traders that USDC is a preferred base currency, as well as the fact that a lot of the new flows into crypto are starting with on-exchange activity,” Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of peer-to-peer payments company Circle, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson. He noted that USDC issuance in January saw “record levels.” Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase are behind USDC’s governing Centre consortium.

The circulating supply of USDC, which is valued 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, has grown to over 5 billion from just below 4 billion in the beginning of the month, sharp growth after slowing in October, according to data from Glassnode.

Increased exchange activity is also reflected in the significant price rise of exchanges’ utility tokens. Centralized exchanges Binance and FTX and decentralized exchanges Uniswap and SushiSwap all saw their exchange tokens hit new all-time highs in the past week.

As of press time, MakerDAO did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment regarding its dai stablecoin.

Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that tether (USDT) is still the stablecoin king despite recent controversies involving its issuing company. Tether currently has over $27 billion in market capitalization but its balance on exchanges in the past two months has been more volatile.

When interest in blockchain peaked three years ago, most companies had a plan (or at least a PR announcement) for force-fitting what Dennis Howlett called ""the most over-hyped yet least understood technology shift I've ever seen"" into their operations, whether it made sense or not. Little did anyone know that perhaps the most promising corporate blockchain application might be the one that made the technology a household name: digital currency.

Until recently, Bitcoin's immature financial ecosystem, extreme volatility and legal ambiguities made it inappropriate for anyone but speculators. Since falling from its first peak in December 2017, the financial infrastructure for cryptocurrency has significantly matured, however, a recent price spike has seen a return of the volatility that spooked investors three years ago. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 response by central banks and sovereign treasuries is even more worrisome to some, including a small list of companies trading their dollars for Bitcoin.

The governmental response to the calamities of 2020, which saw the U.S. Federal Reserve expand its balance sheet by more than 75 percent ($3.25 trillion), the U.S. Treasury accumulate $3.7 trillion in debt since the end of FY2019 and the European Central Bank add more than €2 trillion is unprecedented. Such a massive expansion in financial assets has many questioning the long-term value of fiat currency and looking for alternative assets such as commodities and cryptocurrencies as hedges against inflation. Wealthy individuals have started using cryptocurrencies to supplement other alternative investments and several corporations, notably MicroStrategy have chosen to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Since adopting Bitcoin as a primary holding in its treasury, MicroStrategy's share price has quadrupled, significantly outperforming Bitcoin itself. Although the company had some strong earnings reports since then, cryptocurrency enthusiasm and significant appreciation of its Bitcoin assets undoubtedly contributed to the rise.

(Via author)

CEO Michael Saylor explained the company's rationale this way (emphasis added):

This investment reflects our belief that Bitcoin, as the world’s most widely-adopted cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash. Since its inception over a decade ago, Bitcoin has emerged as a significant addition to the global financial system, with characteristics that are useful to both individuals and institutions. MicroStrategy has recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made Bitcoin the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy.

Investment or gamble?

MicroStrategy didn't take the decision lightly, deliberating it for months before concluding that Bitcoin mitigates several macroeconomic risks to its reserve holdings. These primarily stem from the continued uncertainties due to Covid and subsequent policy response I illustrated above, or as Saylor put it, ""unprecedented government financial stimulus measures including quantitative easing adopted around the world."" He shares concerns about a potentially inflationary financial policy and still struggling economy that investors traditionally hedge against by purchasing precious metals, but now have some turning to cryptocurrencies (emphasis added):

We believe that, together, these and other factors may well have a significant depreciating effect on the long-term real value of fiat currencies and many other conventional asset types, including many of the assets traditionally held as part of corporate treasury operations. In considering various asset classes for potential investment, MicroStrategy observed distinctive properties of Bitcoin that led it to believe investing in the cryptocurrency would provide not only a reasonable hedge against inflation, but also the prospect of earning a higher return than other investments.

Indeed, Saylor proceeds to call Bitcoin ""digital gold,"" adding that its value will further increase as network effects create a virtuous cycle of greater innovation and adoption. Saylor and other MicroStrategy execs reiterated their Bitcoin stance when discussing the company's recent Q4 2020 earnings. The CFO said MicroStrategy purchased 70,469 Bitcoins for an aggregate price of $1.125 billion, making its average price $15,964 per Bitcoin with an unrealized (paper) gain of $1.27 billion based on a recent price of $34,000. When asked if MicroStrategy was simply using Bitcoin as a ""buy low, sell high"" investment vehicle, Saylor stressed that it's not, but rather sees Bitcoin as a strategic investment, saying (emphasis added):

Our belief is that Bitcoin is the first effective digital monetary network, and it's going to grow over time. We're early adopters, the early Bitcoin holders or adopters. It's the solution to every company's problem and every individual investor's problem. And so as more and more corporations adopt the Bitcoin's standard and they use it as a store of value, as more investors and mutual funds and hedge funds use it as a store of value, as more individuals use it as a store of value, the overall amount of monetary energy, the total amount of capital flowing into the network is just going to increase in time. And because there's a fixed amount of Bitcoin, that just means the price is going to go up. And as I've said to many people, the nature in the free market is in a free market capital flows from the weakest assets to the strongest assets...We're strategic buyers, and we're looking out a decade or longer, which we think is the right way to think about this.

Although MicroStrategy is holding Bitcoin for the long term, one analyst raised an pertinent accounting question about how the volatility of Bitcoin's dollar price affects MicroStrategy's quarterly balance sheet. Its CFO answered that the company treats Bitcoin as an intangible asset and that GAAP requires it to mark its digital wallets to market every quarter, creating balance sheet fluctuations that showed up between Q3 and Q4. However, the company also reports non-GAAP financials that better reflect the underlying book value of its holdings, adding "" there's transparency into both means, the book value and a potential market value.""

Counter arguments

Bitcoin proponents refer to it as a digital currency, however, the designation is more aspirational than actual since Bitcoin isn't widely accepted as a medium of exchange, with the dollar volume of Bitcoin payments about 1/2000th the size of annual U.S. retail sales. The other significant critique of Bitcoin is its volatility. Even when priced using another popular inflation hedge, gold, Bitcoin's value has spanned a 4:1 range over the past year.

Some investors counter that such volatility makes Bitcoin a more efficient hedge against other assets since it means you don't need much to diversify a portfolio. For example, the VP of research at Morningstar estimates that a 5 percent share in Bitcoin diversifies a balanced portfolio as effectively as a 25 percent allocation in an 'alternative' Hedged Equity mutual fund that uses options to reduce volatility. Bitcoin as a portfolio hedge also has the advantage of being almost completely uncorrelated to both equities and gold.

Another recurring critique is that Bitcoin's price is artificially inflated by purchases from other crypto currencies, particularly Tether, that can create (rather than mine as the case for Bitcoin) new tokens on demand. However, the Tether fraud argument has been debunked by crypto analysts who point out that at 4 percent that of Bitcoin, Tether's market capitalization is far too small to move the price.

Corporate Bitcoin beyond MicroStrategy

MicroStrategy is the largest and most prominent, but several other companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy remains unique as the only non-financial firm, since others with significant Bitcoin portfolios operate Bitcoin funds or are investment managers. A site that tracks corporate Bitcoin holdings shows an aggregate value of about $44 billion, with MicroStrategy accounting for almost six percent of the total.

MicroStrategy is promoting Bitcoin as a financial asset with a Bitcoin for Corporations track at its MicroStrategy World conference this week, which includes sessions on Bitcoin:

I'll have coverage in my next article should significant news emerge from the event.

My take

Ditching dollars for Bitcoin is a bold move that instantly turned MicroStrategy into an influential force in the crypto currency world. Given Bitcoin's volatility and recent price appreciation (and pullback) it also significantly muddled its financial reporting and corporate strategy to the point that one analyst asked Saylor whether MicroStrategy is still a software company or merely a Bitcoin investment vehicle. Saylor's reply, that the company's primary focus is software but that it plans to continue acquiring Bitcoin to bolster its balance sheet, implies that the company is both, a factor sure to confound financial analysts attempting to value the company.

While there's a good case for Bitcoin as an inflation hedge and vehicle for portfolio diversification, the ecosystem for distributed finance, aka DeFi, is too immature to allow Bitcoin to be broadly used for B2B transactions. However, it behooves corporations wanting to be on the cutting edge of DeFi and smart contracts to include some Bitcoin on their balance sheet and gain experience using Bitcoin as an alternative to wire transfers for B2B payments. More committed DeFi advocates can start playing with Ethereum and wrapped Bitcoin to combine the former's advantages as a smart contract platform with Bitcoin's security and financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin and other crypto currencies have survived stages of euphoria, despair and derision to emerge as a viable, albeit still unstable, financial asset. With AT&T, Microsoft, Overstock soon to be joined by Paypal in accepting Bitcoin payments, MicroStrategy won't be the last major corporation holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Organizations that want to be ready for the mainstreaming of crypto-enabled DeFi should start preparing now.","FILE PHOTO: Representation of the Ethereum virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ethereum hit all-time highs on Wednesday, breaking above $1,500, as traders bought the cryptocurrency ahead of the launch of ethereum futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange next week

Ethereum has seen year-to-date gains of around 120%, compared with bitcoin’s 30%, and hit a new high of $1,576.7 in early London trading on Wednesday.

“The listing of ethereum futures on a regulated exchange should serve to enhance the crypto market structure by allowing investors to gain exposure to the second most important cryptocurrency as a diversifier to bitcoin, or for simply hedging existing ethereum exposures,” wrote JPMorgan strategists in a note to clients.

“It may be that this week’s listing of ethereum futures contracts will be followed by negative price dynamics by enabling some holders of physical ethereum to hedge their exposures,” they added.

But they continued: “a successful launch of ethereum futures this month is likely to be followed by options on ethereum futures, perhaps as early as 2022, in a similar manner to the launch of options on bitcoin futures in the first quarter of 2020”.

Led by bitcoin, cryptocurrencies are gaining traction with more mainstream investors. The euphoria boosted the total market value of all cryptocurrencies above $1 trillion for the first time earlier in January.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin broke out of a consolidation pattern that could see it rise towards new all-time highs.

Ethereum entered price discovery while the technicals point to an upswing towards $1,900.

Meanwhile, the rising number of stablecoins flooding cryptocurrency exchanges suggests traders are preparing to buy.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have sliced through a critical resistance level that kept their prices at bay over the past three weeks. Now that buying pressure is picking back up, these cryptocurrencies face little to no obstacles ahead that would prevent further advances.

Bitcoin Bulls Get Back in Control

Bitcoin has endured a month-long consolidation period that began after prices peaked at an all-time high of nearly $42,000 on Jan. 8. Since then, BTC made a series of lower highs while the $30,000 support continued to reject it from a steeper pullback.

Such market behavior has formed a descending triangle on Bitcoin’s 1-day chart.

A recent spike in the buying pressure was significant enough to push BTC through the triangle’s hypotenuse. Moving past this hurdle has drastically increased the odds for a 30% upswing towards $45,000.

This target is determined by measuring the distance between the widest range of the triangle and adding it to the breakout point.

IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model reveals two supply barriers ahead of Bitcoin that might prevent it from achieving its upside potential.

Based on this on-chain metric, one of them sits at $37,000, where roughly 330,000 addresses had previously purchased nearly 200,000 BTC. The second major interest area lies at $38,400 since 350,000 addresses hold more than 230,000 BTC around this price level.

These supply walls may have the ability to absorb some of the buying pressure seen recently. Holders who have been underwater may try to break even on their positions, slowing down the uptrend. But if Bitcoin can slice through these hurdles, it would likely climb to $45,000.

On the flip side, the IOMAP cohorts show that Bitcoin sits on top of stable support. Approximately 700,000 addresses bought over 400,000 BTC between $34,640 and $35,680. If this crucial area of interest fails to hold, the bears will struggle to push prices further down as 1.10 million addresses hold more than 500,000 BTC at $33,340.

Given the strength of these demand barriers, only a daily candlestick close below $32,000 will invalidate the bullish outlook and lead to a steep correction.

Ethereum Rises to New All-Time Highs

Ethereum made headlines after it broke decisively through the $1,400 resistance level. The bullish impulse was significant enough to encourage market participants to buy more ETH in anticipation of higher highs.

As buy orders piled up across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, ETH was able to break out of an ascending triangle where it had been contained over the past three weeks.

Now that Ethereum has entered price discovery mode after rising to a new all-time high of $1,550, the chances for another 22% surge to $1,900 have drastically increased. This target is defined by measuring the distance of the triangle’s y-axis and adding it to the x-axis.

IntoTheBlock’s IOMAP model estimates that $1,330 plays a crucial role in Ethereum’s trend. Transaction history shows that this is the largest demand barrier underneath this altcoin that could hold prices in the event of a sudden correction.

Here, nearly 157,000 addresses had previously purchased 6.60 million ETH. This area could absorb some of the selling pressure if ETH’s breakout gets rejected.

That said, it would be catastrophic for those betting to the upside if the $1,330 support level breaks. The IOMAP cohorts show that the next significant support level reinforcing Ethereum’s uptrend sits around $1,200.

Therefore, ETH holders should expect their investments to plunge by 10% if the $1,330 support breaks.

Massive Buying Power Sits on the Sidelines

Though uncertainty reigns after the pump and dumps seen over the past week, it seems like Bitcoin and Ethereum are primed for higher highs.

The Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) indicator has been steadily declining since the beginning of the year as more stablecoins are minted to meet the market’s demand.

A low SSR is indicative of mounting buying power ready to flow into the cryptocurrency market.

“SSR decreases when the price of BTC is low or when more stablecoins are entering circulation. The fact that SSR is so low even as Bitcoin maintains high prices demonstrates just how many new stablecoins have entered the ecosystem recently,” said Glassnode.

As more stablecoins get deposited into exchanges, it signals that investors are preparing to buy up cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

If this is the case, FOMO might kick in as soon as BTC regains $40,000 as support triggering a new uptrend across the entire cryptocurrency market.

ETHUSD, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, passed $1,500 for the first time on Tuesday. Unlike larger peer Bitcoin (BTCUSD), which broke its 2017 records last December, ETHUSD had challenged old peaks without closing above them. That is, until yesterday.

The price surge comes with CME’s Ethereum futures set to begin trading Sunday evening. They will be the exchange’s second crypto-based futures product, following the launch of Bitcoin contracts three years ago.

Two other products this month will also give investors access to Ethereum. Grayscale announced on Monday it would reopen its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to accredited investors. Galaxy Digital also plans to launch an Ethereum-based fund for institutional investors in mid-February.

Why Is Ethereum Going Up?

Ethereum has rallied up as decentralized finance (DeFi) gains acceptance. DeFi uses Ethereum as an operating system for loans with “smart contracts” as intermediaries. Smart contracts are fully automated financial programs running on Ethereum. (They’re a way investors can earn interest on crypto holdings.)

Over $28 billion of value was locked up in the DeFi market yesterday, according to DeFi Pulse. It’s increased 82 percent since the end of 2020.

Ethereum (ETHUSD), daily chart, courtesy of TradingView.

Backers think it’s just the tip of the iceberg. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, predicted in a November 10 YouTube interview that credit-card issues will start using Ethereum in coming months. Mainstream lenders and central banks could follow.

“I think you’ll see more projects migrate” to Ethereum, Novogratz said. “That’s what’s going to drive the attention.”

Ethereum 2.0

Ethereum is also in the process of a major upgrade that will change its mining system from “proof of work” (PoW) to “proof of stake” (PoS). The new rules will pay validators based on the number of coins they own, rather than speed of calculating blocks. That structure is considered faster than PoW, which is used by Bitcoin.

Ethereum 2.0 will also use the computing technique “sharding” that breaks up work into smaller parallel pieces, helping to increase its speed over 5,000-fold. The result is expected to be a fast, reliable, anonymous transaction system. Participants will pay in fractions of Ether known as “wei” (one-billionth of a coin).

Ethereum and Fee Burning

Other changes that could be implemented soon are BASEFEE and so-called “fee burning.” Introduced under EIP-1559 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal), these new standards would calculate a base level for fees and make Ethereum the sole cryptocurrency for payments. Proponents say it would make transaction fees more predictable (potentially encouraging use), while also reducing new supply. Both forces could be positive for Ethereum.

In conclusion, the world of cryptocurrencies continues to advance as more investors gain access to digital assets. Bitcoin was in the spotlight when it gained wider acceptance and broke out last year. Now attention may be shifting to Ethereum.","Why did this happen?

According to the exchange’s page about the new product, Binance Pay, currently in beta, allows users to make “contactless, borderless and secure” cryptocurrency payments around the world.

“Binance Pay is a basket product which we do plan to spend a lot of effort on this year. We think that payments is one of the most obvious use cases for crypto,” said Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance, announcing the news at the virtual Binance Blockchain Week event Tuesday.

The Pay platform allows users to pay and be paid in five cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, ether, swipe (SXP), BNB and BUSD – and one fiat currency so far, the euro.

When CoinDesk asked Binance if it intends to add more payment options, a representative said more information on “functionalities and plans” would be released soon.

Users will need to top up their Binance Pay wallets (shared with the Binance Card wallet) in order to make payments. QR codes are generated when a payment is made that can be scanned by the recipient in order to receive their funds.

According to CZ, payments is one of the “most obvious use cases for crypto,” but merchants face difficulties with fluctuating prices and low adoption.

Binance Pay gives merchants the option to accept fiat-backed stablecoins (so far limited to its own BUSD token) so they aren’t affected by price volatility, he said.","Dive Brief:

The cryptocurrency exchange Gemini on Tuesday launched a savings product, dubbed Earn, that lets customers move their holdings in Bitcoin, or any of the 26 cryptocurrencies Gemini supports, into accounts yielding interest as high as 7.4%.

Gemini said it can afford to pay relatively high rates — by comparison, the average savings account in the U.S. yields 0.05% interest, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) data — because it lends the cryptocurrency deposits to institutional borrowers through a partner, Genesis Global Capital, at a higher interest rate.

Customers should plan to assume considerably more risk than with a traditional bank's savings account. Deposits aren't protected by the FDIC, and there's no central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to set benchmark interest rates. Rather, Gemini and other providers adjust rates based on their own supply-and-demand analysis.

Dive Insight:

Earn marks a continuing expansion of Gemini's products in banking-adjacent spaces. Gemini bought fintech startup Blockrize last month to help build its own credit card offering rewards of up to 3% in cryptocurrencies. JPMorgan Chase extended banking services to the crypto exchange last spring.

Gemini touts Earn as the first account of its kind available in all 50 states. Crypto lender BlockFi offers an account with up to 8.6% annual percentage yield (APY) on deposits, but it is not available in New York. Gemini, by contrast, is regulated by New York's Department of Financial Services. Earn will not, however, be available to clients outside the U.S.

The Earn offering opened to existing Gemini customers Tuesday. Gemini said it expects later this month to allow clients of competing exchanges to transfer their assets into Earn accounts. Account holders can withdraw their crypto assets at any time without penalties or fees.

Hans Morris, a managing partner at the venture capital firm NYCA Partners, characterized the Earn offering as part of the ""creeping normalization of crypto.""

""It will be something to watch if noncrypto holders are brought in by the offering of interest accounts,"" he told American Banker.

Noah Perlman, Gemini's chief operating officer, said the product should be seen as more of an investment than a savings account. ""It lets investors put their passive crypto assets to work and earn a return at competitive rates,"" he told Bloomberg.

However, Perlman told American Banker, ""You're always going to have maximalists, in any space ... and I wouldn't be surprised given the delta between the interest offered on a traditional banking account that you might have consumers who decide to take their entire savings and checking balance and move it to Gemini, to earn the compelling interest.""

It's also likely, Perlman said, that a crypto account like Earn would become one silo in a user's portfolio, alongside fixed income, equity and cash.

The annual percentage yield Earn offers varies by currency from 1.54% for Balancer to 7.4% for Filecoin. Bitcoin and Ether, the most popular currencies, each yield 3.05%.

But the past year has shown the value of Bitcoin, for example, can swing wildly. Its worth has roughly quadrupled since early February 2020 — to well over $36,000 now — but dipped to $4,107 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Yahoo Finance.

Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti Bank, said the Earn program can offer a high APY because of the volatility of crypto's value — and because only 20% to 25% is outside of self-custody and available for lending.

That lack of availability might prompt institutions to pay Gemini a higher rate for borrowing — Perlman calls that ""part of a maturation of the [crypto] space"" — but some of that risk passes to the consumer.

Gemini warns in its account terms and conditions that customers' digital assets will leave the exchange's custody, ""and you accept the risk of loss associated with loan transactions, up to and including total loss of your available digital assets.""

""Consumers need to appreciate that this is nothing like putting your cash in a savings account,"" Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at the British investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, told Bloomberg. ""There's a real danger if people assume they can make a big return without risking capital.""

For one, it's difficult to track the solvency of the intermediaries attached to Gemini's Earn, Long told American Banker.

""There's no financial disclosure [in the Bitcoin lending market] and almost no regulatory examination of intermediaries — and most of them are not audited either,"" she said. ""So, it's not possible to do counterparty credit risk analysis in this market.""

Perlman told CNBC each customer has to assess their own risk tolerance, but reinforced that Gemini's security protocols are ""on par with those offered by top financial institutions.""

""We still think that crypto empowers individuals in a way that traditional banks don't,"" he told the network. ""But, at the same time, there is a reason why Wall Street and traditional banking has been around as long as it has ... It provides lots of safeguards, and we think that we can get the best of both worlds and offer that to our customers.""","Bitcoin is no longer the sole star in the crypto scene. Yes, no one is denying that the coin still holds the numero uno stature, but it is also true that the crypto world has recently embraced a bunch of new coins that speak of great promise as well. Among the new powerful coins that can pose serious competition to BTC today, one of the crucial names is Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

The article below offers a comparative study on the two so that you can have a better understanding of which one to invest in.

Bitcoin

Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is a trailblazer in the cryptocurrency scene. The biggest cryptocurrency to date, BTC was developed to introduce a cutting-edge decentralized P2P electronic cash that is based on advanced

blockchain technology. Given its decentralized infrastructure, Bitcoin cannot be governed or controlled by any single authority. All the Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a decentralized global immutable and encryption-guarded blockchain-based ledger. As a result, no one can alter or censor BTC transactions which makes them way safer compared to traditional fiat money.

But, one of the major drawbacks of BTC is its extremely restricted block size limit which is a mere 1 MB. It was not a problem initially but as the coin started gaining traction, this limited block size proved to be insufficient to manage an increased flow of transactions on a daily basis.

No wonder, the crypto world started looking for options that can beat the scalability issue of Bitcoin and assure better speed. It led to the birth of more competitive coins like Bitcoin Cash among many others.

Bitcoin Cash

Interestingly, Bitcoin Cash was launched in 2017 through Bitcoin hard fork to present a coin with better scalability than Bitcoin. While BTC was introduced with a 1 MB block size, BCH was launched with an 8x bigger 8 MB size. Later on, the block size was further scaled to an even grander 32 MB.

In other words, BCH is designed with a faster transfer speed that enables it to manage more transactions (compared to BTC) per second. As a result, more people would be able to use Bitcoin Cash simultaneously compared to what you would find with Bitcoin. Also, BCH assures more economical transaction fees ($0.20) compared to that of Bitcoin ($1).

So, Which One?

What we can infer here is that Bitcoin Cash has a much stronger capacity to handle a growing scale of the user base. The crypto scene is gaining momentum with each passing month, and you have more people looking forward to testing the waters now than you had 7-8 years back. In that light, you need a coin with increased scalability to handle increasing traffic and Bitcoin Cash surely shows immense promise here. The cheaper transaction rate is another big draw here.

So, which one to go for? Well, both the coins mentioned here are great in their own aspects. But, while Bitcoin is still ruling the roost, Bitcoin Cash also shows a brighter future with its stronger emphasis on far improved scalability, and economical transaction fees. Yes, Bitcoin will remain the king and most likely the most traded ones, but Bitcoin Cash will clearly take a strong part by its improvement and continuous adoption.

Ether (ETH) prices were lower after surging 10% on Wednesday to a new record, climbing past $1,600 for the first time.

The recent gains appeared driven by signs of growth on the cryptocurrency’s underlying Ethereum blockchain network, as well as interest from institutional investors starting to venture beyond bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency.

“Ethereum is in such high demand because the asset is undergoing changes to make it even more decentralized and even more secure,” said Simon Peters, an analyst for the trading platform eToro. “This is attracting buyers from both the institutional and retail world.”

Bitcoin (BTC) appeared to lose momentum after its steady rise over the past week from $30,000 to about $38,000.

The price level of $38,190 proved tough to pierce, according to Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS.

“Once it hit that level, prices seem to struggle and actually just retraced lower, overtaken by massive sell orders on both spot and derivatives exchanges,” Blom wrote. “Stagnation in the $34K-$38K range probably can’t be avoided, and eager bulls might be cooled down by relentless sellers before BTC progresses higher again.”

And dogecoin (DOGE)? The digital token launched in 2013 as little more than a joke is up about 50% in just the past two days, for a market value of more than $6 billion. Elon Musk, the electric-vehicle and private-spaceflight entrepreneur who’s also reportedly the world’s richest man, tweeted about it early Thursday. There was also heavy chatter about the token on social media forums, and probably a lot of speculation about the chatter.

In traditional markets, the Reddit-fueled whiplash in shares of “meme stocks” like GameStop (GME) appeared to subside, but the regulatory fallout might just be getting going: U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who heads the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said Wednesday she wants Reddit user Keith “DeepF***ingValue” Gill to testify at a Feb. 18 hearing along with executives from the retail trading platform Robinhood and the hedge funds Melvin Capital and Citadel.

Stocks were pointing higher while gold weakened 1.1% to $1,814 an ounce.

Visa's plans push crypto industry closer to point of no return

With 3.3 billion payment cards in use, Visa (V) is a household name. It’s also one of the biggest players in the global financial infrastructure, processing some 188.1 billion transactions a year.

That’s why it was such big news for the cryptocurrency industry on Wednesday when Visa announced it is piloting a new program that will allow banks to offer bitcoin services. Previously, Visa had been focused on helping crypto companies issue bank cards and has partnered with 35 crypto firms to date, but this is the first time the company has offered crypto services to banks.

The market impact? Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the brokerage Oanda, wrote Wednesday the news may have helped to push up bitcoin’s price. “Bitcoin’s acceptance continues to improve,” Moya wrote.

Another takeaway might be that Visa’s splashy move could make it harder for U.S. lawmakers or regulators to thwart bitcoin’s growth. Ray Dalio, of the giant hedge fund Bridgewater, and former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein have suggested that authorities might look to crack down on the fast-emerging cryptocurrency if it really starts to take off.

Think of the operational, technological and marketing expenses involved in Visa’s new project. The chances are low that a big, heavily regulated financial company would push forward without some assurances that there’s no turning back from crypto. Or that Visa would make this move before heavy consultations with key corporate customers, including big credit-card lenders such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America.

The more investments established companies make in the business, the less likely authorities are to force write-offs.

Ether rally spreads beyond ether. Dogecoin has nothing to do with it.

The average fee for sending a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain has climbed above $20 for the first time, in a sign of just how popular the network is becoming. Source: Blockchair

It’s not just ether rallying to a new all-time high this week: Also rising were major digital tokens from the realm of decentralized finance, or DeFi, where entrepreneurs are building software-automated versions of banks and trading platforms atop decentralized, Internet-based networks, mainly the Ethereum blockchain, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported Wednesday.

DeFi tokens including price-feed-provider Chainlink’s LINK, the decentralized exchange SushiSwap’s SUSHI and the DeFi lender Aave’s AAVE have logged new historic highs.

Prices for SUSHI, whose launch last year met with immediate controversy, have quadrupled already in 2021 amid bullish speculation over the future of DeFi. Based on data from the analysis firm Messari, that’s the second-highest gain among digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion – after dogecoin (DOGE), which offers little more than meme-y yuks to its adoring fans. (Dogecoin has nearly sextupled this year, for those keeping track.)

Also getting a lift were prices for cryptocurrencies associated with blockchains that are competing with Ethereum to become dominant platforms for decentralized computer applications. Sometimes referred to colloquially as “Ethereum killers,” they include Polkadot’s DOT token and Solana’s SOL.

“Ether made a significant push, and that is causing projects linked to the DeFi space” to rise, said Hunain Naseer, senior content editor at crypto exchange OKEX’s research unit, OKEx Insights.

One downside from the flurry of activity on the Ethereum blockchain might be elevated fees for sending transactions over the network, since the rate paid rises with increasing congestion. As reported by CoinDesk’s Will Foxley, the average transaction fee early Thursday climbed above $20 for the first time, reflecting growing demand for tokens launched atop the Ethereum blockchain. Those include the dollar-linked digital tokens known as stablecoins as well as DeFi-related tokens.

A catalyst for further price action might come from the Chicago-based CME’s launch of a new futures contract on ether next week. The listing should give more institutional investors a way to bet on the second-largest cryptocurrency after they took positions in bitcoin last year.

“The institutions are buying ether,” Ryan Sean Adams, founder of newsletter Bankless, wrote in a tweet. “And they’re just getting started.”

Bond traders are increasing their expectations for inflation

So-called breakeven inflation rates, or the pace of price increases implied by U.S. government bond markets, have reached an eight-year high and are climbing fast. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis

The Federal Reserve’s mantra over the past year as the coronavirus wreaked a devastating toll on the economy is that there’s no need to worry about inflation; in fact, as Chair Jerome Powell was quick to point out, recessions often lead to deflation because flagging consumer demand can prompt businesses to cut prices while elevated unemployment mutes upward pressures on wages.

Despite the assurances, big investors and corporations have piled into bitcoin over the past year, betting the cryptocurrency, whose supply is limited under the blockchain network’s underlying programming, could serve as a hedge against loose monetary policy, aka near-zero interest rates and trillions of dollars of money printing.

But now there are signs another key market segment might be getting more concerned about inflation: bond traders.

The five-year “breakeven inflation rate,” which can be derived by examining the yields on various U.S. government bonds, is now signaling a 2.2% average rate over the next five years. That’s the highest in eight years, and it’s also above the Fed’s long-term target of 2%. What’s more, the figure appears to be rising fast: As recently as September, the breakeven inflation rate was below 1.5%.

As noted this week by First Mover, economists are already starting to sketch out how fast the economy might heat up as more people get vaccines and consumers start to get their confidence back. Bank of America estimates there’s some $1.6 trillion of excess savings on consumer balance sheets, which could quickly translate to pent-up spending demand. And the economy has yet to feel the impact of the stimulus package now being debated in U.S. Congress, likely to total at least $1 trillion.

The national employment situation will become clearer on Friday when the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its jobs report for the month of January. On Wednesday, Pantheon, a macroeconomic forecasting firm, revised its projection to an increase of 200,000; previously the firm was expecting a decline of 100,000 in the nonfarm payrolls. The average expectation of Wall Street economists is for an increase of 100,000, according to Bloomberg. (U.S. jobless claims were lower than expected last week, at 779,000, according to a report early Thursday.)

“The reflationary trends we are seeing in markets are likely to continue throughout 2021,” according to a report Wednesday from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

Bitcoin Watch: Increasing signs of demand from institutional investors

Although bitcoin has failed to sustainably push past the psychologically important $40,000 price level, signs continue to mount of growing interest in the cryptocurrency from big institutional buyers.

Elon Musk has tweeted that dogecoin is the people’s crypto shortly after the billionaire pledged to go off the social media platform for a while. Incidentally, the token, which traded at $0.0411 on February 3, surged to $0.0588 just as Musk was tweeting.

However, at the time of writing, the token appeared to have retreated to $0.0541, a price which is still 60% higher than that of February 3. Following Musk’s previous tweets about the token, dogecoin’s price surged to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.0791, according to Messari data. At the time of writing, the token is still up by more than 400% in the week while its market capitalization stands at $6.74 billion.

Similarly, when Musk amended his Twitter account bio to include the term bitcoin, the crypto’s value surged by more than 20% in a few hours.

Meanwhile, not everyone is impressed with the billionaire’s tweets that have ranged from pumping the dogecoin token to supporting Wallstreetbets traders.

Some analysts have accused Musk of deliberately tweeting about certain stocks and crypto assets for his and his friends’ benefit. Consequently, others now want regulators to get involved after alleging that Musk’s market-moving tweets are hurting “the little guy.” Some Twitter users believe this is what may have prompted Musk, the world’s richest person, to announce that he was going off Twitter.

However, since ending his brief self-imposed exile from Twitter, Musk has talked up the dogecoin in at least five tweets. Meanwhile, on Twitter, some users thanked Musk for helping them profit from the token while others asked if he could do the same for other tokens. Still, others like one Twitter user, Poison joked that he had incurred losses “because I listened to you man.”

While a number of digital currencies have seen price gains the two leading crypto assets, bitcoin and ethereum have seen transaction fees skyrocket. For instance, data shows that the median fee for a bitcoin transaction is $8.58, while the median fee is $9.35 when spending ether. Meanwhile, the average transaction fee for both networks has been much higher between $14 to over $20 per transfer.

During the course of 2021, crypto assets have increased a great deal in value but alongside this, the fees to transact on these networks have risen as well. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the two largest blockchains, in terms of market capitalization. The two networks also take the cake when it comes to expensive transactions and this has been a complaint on social media and crypto-focused forums.

At the time of writing, according to bitinfocharts.com data, the average transaction fee for bitcoin (BTC) is 0.00038 BTC or $14.25 USD per transfer. Of course, the median sized transaction is lower on the BTC network, but still $8.58 per transaction according to today’s messari.io data. Stats show that the average transaction fee on the ETH network today is 0.013 ETH or $20.68 USD at the time of writing. Messari stats show the median fees for ETH is also higher than BTC, but lower than the average ETH transaction, at $9.35 per transfer.

Of course, people have been complaining about the fees and the backlog of transactions. “Always remember people,” one person tweeted. “The sky high transaction fees of ethereum [and] bitcoin are there so someone wants to make profit, not because they’re necessary.” Financial reporter, Kyle Torpey tweeted about the fact that it cost more to send wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) using Ethereum, than it does to transfer bitcoin onchain.

Other digital currency fans, specifically ETH supporters believe the high fees problem will be fixed. “On the surface, it looks far overstretched, but 2.0 is going to massively increase ETH’s speed, scalability, and value,” an individual claimed on Twitter. “Those outrageous fees will become a thing of the past.”

Bitcoin cash proponents also discussed the massive fees on both the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks during the course of the past week. The cost to get a transfer into the next block using the BCH network costs $0.0021 according to bitcoinfees.cash statistics. The current median fee on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain on February 4, 2021, is $0.0009. Bitcoin.com founder Roger Ver recently appeared with the nomadcapitalist.com founder, Andrew Henderson, and discussed the problem with BTC transaction fees.

“Just try to make a bitcoin transaction and then try to make a bitcoin cash transaction,” Ver explained in the video. “The difference is staggering and may be the only evidence you need to know where you stand in the Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash debate,” the entrepreneur added.

The high fees have also seemingly pushed stablecoins who leverage these networks to alternative blockchains. For instance, when onchain fees became too burdensome, the most popular stablecoin tether (USDT) started migrating from BTC (Omni Layer) to the Ethereum chain. Since the ETH network fees have spiked in recent months, recently USDT settlements have seen more action on the Tron blockchain. Additionally, the second most popular stablecoin USDC is migrating to the Stellar network and fees may have spurred this decision as well.

Visa’s new APIs will allow banks and other traditional financial outlets to enable their users to make and receive Bitcoin transactions, among other cryptocurrencies

Visa’s new stand, along with the support of PayPal and institutional investors, signals a tremendous change in acceptance and policy from traditional finance towards the developing digital assets

Visa, a former staunch enemy of the burgeoning cryptocurrencies market, is completing its turnaround into a Bitcoin supporter – the long-established payments giant has revealed plans to help banks roll out cryptocurrency buying and trading services with a Visa crypto software program, set to launch later this year.

Visa’s announcement comes after a year of institutional and other traditional investors finally coming aboard the crypto as a digital currency bandwagon, buoyed by bullish performances by Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole towards the middle of 2020.

READ NEXT How ‘legitimizing’ cryptocurrency could benefit businesses

Not surprisingly, governments and players in the existing banking system are unwelcoming of payment networks that are “powered by users with no central authority or middlemen.” Many fear that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be used to circumvent capital controls, and can be used for money laundering or illegal purchases.

But wide-scale adoption of crypto also has the potential to render certain traditional finance channels irrelevant, especially if the valuations in the volatile crypto market stabilize. Why would one store their funds in banks with hefty interest rates, for instance, if a stable crypto coin can store value for minimal charges, yet with the potential to gain even more?

That development, if it ever happens, is still far off on the horizon. But the interest from traditional financial services and investment groups to invest in the crypto market, along with calls to formally regulate the space, appear to step in a more fruitful direction.

Over the past year, hedge funds and various institutional investors have changed their tune about Bitcoin and the crypto market in general, now pouring in billions and sending the prices of certain coins skyrocketing. It is an attractive time to be a cryptocurrency trader once again after the initial market boom in 2017-2018, but Visa has actually been quietly working on its crypto software services for some time.

The credit card firm has been partnering with 35 various bitcoin and cryptocurrency platforms in recent years, and the company is finally ready to roll out Bitcoin and cryptocurrency buying and trading services that are intended to help banks, the traditional bastion of finance, ease into onboarding crypto transactions and trades.

A US bank in Kansas will be the first to pilot the Visa APIs, which will help the card issuer’s bank clients integrate Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies. It’s understood banks will be able to allow their users to withdraw and self-custody their crypto holdings, a departure from Visa rival PayPal, which also joined the crypto acceptance train late but drew criticism for preventing people from moving their holdings off its platform.

The price of Bitcoin and other notable cryptos like Ethereum have surged of late thanks to the support of institutional investors and PayPal, drawing global attention once again. But Bitcoin’s growing popularity among investors as a speculative asset and a hedge against inflation has reduced its perceived utility as an alternative payment method.

“We see crypto assets as more like digital gold,” Visa’s head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, told Forbes over the phone. “There’s less demand to spend Bitcoin.”

His comments on “digital gold” echo those of Visa chief executive Al Kelly, indicating the card company as a whole view Bitcoin and possibly all crypto assets more for their function as a store of value, rather than as a form of payment.

Kelly also pointed out that digital currency exchanges and platforms like Crypto.com, BlockFi, and BitPanda have begun issuing Visa cards, telling a Q1 2021 earnings call that “Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials or to cash out onto our Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally.”","Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- The surprise takeover bid for Toshiba Corp. is a palpable demonstration of the growing influence in corporate Japan of activist investors, who have gone from largely impotent onlookers to kingmakers in the space of just a few years.The offer from CVC Capital Partners, while still in the early stages, comes just weeks after Toshiba Chief Executive Officer Nobuaki Kurumatani lost a landmark shareholder vote, forcing an independent investigation into alleged issues with voting at its annual general meeting last year.That loss has piled pressure on Kurumatani, who barely won re-election at last year’s meeting and is seen as unlikely to survive another. The vote was triggered by Toshiba’s largest shareholder, the secretive Singapore-based hedge fund Effissimo Capital Management.Any deal for Toshiba faces legal hurdles, and analysts say that investors such as Effissimo would likely insist on a substantial premium from Tuesday’s closing price.

A bid at that level would value Toshiba at about 2.28 trillion yen ($20.7 billion) and represent a 31% premium to its last close before news of the bid emerged, data compiled by Bloomberg show.That would make it the largest private equity-led buyout since 2013, and CVC’s biggest acquisition on record. Toshiba’s board plans to form a special committee to consider the proposal, said the executive, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.While there are many hurdles to a deal taking place, Toshiba shares rose by their daily limit of 18% to 4,530 yen per share at the close in Tokyo.“Considerable value would be created simply by simplifying ownership and clarifying governance by taking the company private,” said Nicholas Benes, an expert on Japanese corporate governance. “Precisely because of that, one would very much hope that this is a case where Toshiba will be open to other bids, by both other PE firms as well as strategic acquirers.”Activist investors have increasingly been flexing their muscle in Japan in recent years, as corporate governance reforms promoting shareholder value have meant management can no longer dismiss such pressure.

The price of bitcoin is now in the fourth day of an upward trend, going as high as $38,332 at 14:00 UTC (9 a.m. ET) before losing some steam heading into the weekend. It was down to $37,751 as of press time.

“Similar to the last bull run, we are seeing bitcoin initially steal the attention as retail adoption pours in through mainstream attention,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer for trading firm Global Digital Asset.

However, Gord told CoinDesk traders are rotating out of bitcoin to high-flying digital assets. “Bitcoin then cools off and profits generated from bitcoin find themselves first in ether, then in other high market-cap digital assets,” Gord said.

Nevertheless, fresh interest such as from Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, which manages $150 billion in investor money, has some including quantitative trading firm QCP Capital highly bullish on bitcoin.

“Bridgewater’s piece out last week had a sensitivity analysis which showed their estimates of BTC price, should private holders of gold switch to BTC,” states QCP’s weekly investor note Friday. “They forecasted that should 50% of capital in gold move into BTC, that would result in a price of $85,000 per 1 BTC.”

Investors are certainly looking to crypto as an asset class, but bitcoin is still quite volatile; its 30-day volatility from Thursday’s close is at 102.9% on an annualized basis whereas gold is at 16%.

Yet, crypto advocates see bitcoin and ether (ETH) similar to different asset classes, according to Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange BitFlyer USA. “My guess is that BTC is like gold and priced by the value it stores, a scarce commodity in price discovery,” Edgerton said. “ETH is more like a stock and priced by the value it delivers (ETH 2.0, network effects, basis for DeFi).” He said he thinks of ether as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for decentralized finance.

While bitcoin has performed well so far in 2021 – it’s up 29% – ether’s returns have more than quadrupled, gaining 129%.

“Ether is surging largely on the back of the growth in decentralized finance projects that rely on ERC-20 tokens to operate,” Guy Hirsch, managing director of U.S. for eToro. “Since ETH has not previously traded this high, it’s hard to tell what kind of support there is but, should DeFi projects continue to grow at the rate they are, it would be hard for ETH to not also continue setting new records.”

One thing to watch during a heated ether market is the ETH/BTC trading pair. A rise in this market signals traders are selling their bitcoin for ether; it has appreciated over 75% in 2021.

“While bitcoin consolidates and trends back towards all-time highs, much of the price action has focused on the ETH and DeFi space,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin. “ETH/BTC has almost doubled in the last month.”

Ether dominance up ahead of CME launch

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday, trading around $1,714 and climbing 3.3% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). It hit a brand-new price high Friday, at $1,761, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

The dominance of ether, a measure of the asset to the larger $1.1 trillion market cap of cryptocurrencies overall, is now at over 17%. That’s a more than 50% increase since the beginning of 2021, according to metrics calculated by charting software TradingView.

Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower Capital, told CoinDesk that crypto traders have been scooping up ETH ahead of institutional-friendly CME launching ether futures Feb. 8. “I think that many traders are building positions ahead of the launch,” he said.

“The availability of CME-listed ETH futures could be a significant positive catalyst,” said Steinglass. “The addition of CME futures will open the door to many potential investors who want to have exposure, but have yet to take any positions due to logistical hurdles.”

“With decentralized exchange trading surging yet again, and yield farming showing no sign of easing, growing interest in leveraged farming products is driving demand for ETH ever so higher and shows the market is only going to grow further,” noted Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage Bequant.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Futures on ether, the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and daily volume, will launch late Sunday on derivatives exchange CME, as investors seek to take advantage of mounting institutional interest in this evolving asset class.

Ether, which has long lived in bitcoin's shadow, is the digital currency or token that facilitates transactions on the ethereum blockchain. In the crypto world, the terms ether and ethereum have become interchangeable.

While bitcoin is the preferred store of value in the digital ecosystem, ethereum has emerged as the leading financial infrastructure, settling more than $12 billion in daily transactions, according to digital asset manager GrayScale's latest report.

The CME listing allows investors to diversify crypto holdings outside of bitcoin and provides an avenue for investors to hedge their ethereum exposure, opening a market where bearish positions on the asset can be readily expressed.

Ether futures, which follow those of bitcoin's listing in December 2017, will be cash-settled and will be priced based on a CME reference rate that draws data from major cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, and Kraken.

Investors don't expect huge volumes out of the gate, much like when bitcoin futures launched three years ago, but the asset should gain traction as an easy way to get access to another crypto-based network, said John Wu, president of AVA Labs, an open-source platform for creating financial applications using blockchain technology.

""This will introduce new people and organizations to crypto and to the programmable smart contract side of the ecosystem, rather than just a store of value and digital gold,"" Wu added.

Smart contracts are self-executing transactions.

Ethereum hit a record high of $1,764.55 on Friday, ahead of its futures launch, which helped boost the crypto sector's market cap to about $1.2 trillion, according to data tracker CoinGecko.com. It was last up 8% at $1,729.59.

(Graphic: Ethereum on the rise: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlknropb/ethereum.PNG)

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was up 2.5% at $37,892. It hit a record high of $42,000 on Jan. 8.

Since the launch of bitcoin futures three years ago, the CME has noted significant growth in their adoption from a broad array of participants, including institutional investors.

Since the beginning of 2020, a total of 8,560 CME bitcoin futures contracts, equivalent to about 42,800 bitcoins, have traded on average per day, the CME said in a statement. Institutional interest has also increased, with the number of large open interest holders reaching a record of 110 in December.

The latest CME data also showed bitcoin's net shorts of 2,781 contracts last week were the smallest since late November.

(Graphic: Bitcoin futures vs asset price: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaoexeva/Bitcoin%20futures.PNG)

JP Morgan in a research note suggested that ether futures' listing could be followed by a fall in the price of the underlying currency, much like what happened when bitcoin futures started trading. The new contracts will enable holders of physical ethereum to hedge their exposure.

Global investors have started pouring cash into ethereum funds and products, with about $56.1 million in inflows in January, according to a report on institutional flows from digital currency manager CoinShares. Bitcoin remains the recipient of the bulk of overall investor flows or 92%, equivalent to nearly $2 billion in January.

Ethereum in 2020 attracted investor flows of $926 million, while bitcoin had $4.5 billion.

Ether price hits record $1,750

Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed a fresh breakout occurring for ETH/USD during Friday trading.

At the time of writing, Ether was targeting $1,750 as 6.5% daily gains topped weekly returns of nearly 22%.

The move came on the back of intense trading interest in DeFi coins, many of which use the Ethereum network as their basis. DeFi produced many of the best movers on weekly timeframes.

Ether meanwhile had already seen brisk upside as anticipation built over the launch of dedicated futures from CME Group, one of the pioneering Bitcoin futures operators. Asset management giant Grayscale began buying ETH for its Ether Trust again this week after a near two-month break.

Gas fees cause headaches

While some well-known cryptocurrency figures, including Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, celebrated price performance, the highs were accompanied by another record — transaction fees.

As Cointelegraph reported, gas fees on the Ethereum network became so high this week that some exchanges were forced to halt ETH withdrawals altogether.

""This is a legit crisis. Going to have to stock up on popcorn to see how Ethereum digs its way out of this,"" Blockstream developer Grubles commented.

According to data from YCharts, the average ETH fee was $23.27 on Feb. 4, the latest date for which statistics were available.

While Bitcoin (BTC) meanwhile simmered below $40,000, macro conditions appeared apt to fuel fresh upside for BTC/USD. As the S&P 500 hit its own all-time highs on Friday, so the U.S. dollar currency index drop, a phenomenon which traditionally implies that Bitcoin will benefit.

A 24-year-old founder of two cryptocurrency hedge funds pleaded guilty to securities fraud on Thursday.

The two hedge funds had more than $100 million in assets, the Department of Justice said.

He embezzled almost all of one's capital to pay for personal expenses including a penthouse apartment.

The founder of a cryptocurrency hedge fund that claimed to use a trading algorithm to capitalize on price differences in several crypto assets pleaded guilty to securities fraud on Thursday, the Department of Justice said.

Stefan He Qin, a 24-year-old Australian national, admitted in court that he had embezzled nearly all the assets raised in his Virgil Sigma Fund, which along with his VQR Multistrategy Fund had more than $100 million in assets, the DOJ said.

Qin used the assets to pay for personal expenses including a penthouse apartment.

Prosecutors said Qin stole money from investors in Virgil Sigma, then tried to pay them back with the assets raised from investors in his second multistrategy fund.

""The whole house of cards has been revealed, and Qin now awaits sentencing for his brazen thievery,"" Audrey Strauss, the acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.

For years Qin made misrepresentations and false promises to lure new investors into his funds. Marketing materials for Virgil Sigma claimed that the strategy had been profitable every month since August 2016 except for March 2017, the DOJ said.

Qin faces a sentence of as long as 20 years in prison.

In a statement, Qin's lawyers said he ""has accepted full responsibility for his actions and is committed to doing what he can to make amends.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors have confiscated more than 50 million euros ($60 million) worth of bitcoin from a fraudster. There’s only one problem: they can’t unlock the money because he won’t give them the password.

The man was sentenced to jail and has since served his term, maintaining his silence throughout while police made repeated failed efforts to crack the code to access more than 1,700 bitcoin, said a prosecutor in the Bavarian town of Kempten.

“We asked him but he didn’t say,” prosecutor Sebastian Murer told Reuters on Friday. “Perhaps he doesn’t know.”

Bitcoin is stored on software known as a digital wallet that is secured through encryption. A password is used as a decryption key to open the wallet and access the bitcoin. When a password is lost the user cannot open the wallet.

The fraudster had been sentenced to more than two years in jail for covertly installing software on other computers to harness their power to “mine” or produce bitcoin.

When he went behind bars, his bitcoin stash would have been worth a fraction of the current value. The price of bitcoin has surged over the past year, hitting a record high of $42,000 in January. It was trading at $37,577 on Friday, according to cryptocurrency and blockchain website Coindesk.

Prosecutors have ensured the man cannot access the largesse, however.

Bitcoin climbed above $38,000 for the third time in a week on Friday in an attempt to hold the key support level.

The cryptocurrency has steadily trended higher after peaking near $42,000 last month and plunging soon after.

Indicators suggest the coin has room to run and will make another run at the $40,000 level, one analyst said.

Bitcoin rose as high as $38,346.61 on Friday as the world's most popular cryptocurrency faced the latest hurdle in its path back to record highs.

The digital token has staged a strong comeback rally over the past week as retail-investor demand fuels new inflows. That momentum now faces a key test as bitcoin struggles to hold above the $38,000 resistance level. Bitcoin rose above the threshold in Thursday trading before sinking back below $37,000 later in the day.

The token traded 1% higher from 24 hours ago, at $38,065.03, as of 10:10 a.m. ET Friday. Despite tumbling from its early January peak, bitcoin is still up 31% year-to-date.

Bitcoin leaped to an all-time high of nearly $42,000 at the start of the year before profit-taking dragged prices back to earth. The token traded in a narrow range of roughly $32,000 before climbing higher through the end of last month.

Friday's climb is the third time in the past week bitcoin edged above the $38,000 level. The token traded above the threshold on January 29 before surrendering the support and sinking as low as $33,000. Thursday's attempt to break above the ceiling gave way to a less dire plunge.

Some technical signals suggest the token could finally enjoy a new price floor. Bitcoin's Relative Strength Index - a gauge of momentum over the past 14 days - sits just above 60. Readings above 70 suggest the cryptocurrency is overbought. Measures of trend fluctuations also suggest Friday's leap could finally pull bitcoin to new heights.

The broader cryptocurrency market has also trended higher thanks to vague backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The world's wealthiest person praised dogecoin in a flurry of Thursday tweets, at one point calling it ""the people's crypto."" The messages kicked of a positive trend across several cryptocurrencies.

The positive momentum and new demand place bitcoin on track for another run at the $40,000 level, Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said Thursday.

The key to how large the impact of each tweet will be, according to the research, depends on whether Musk is reacting to activity that is already happening in the market or if he is independently sharing a thought out of the blue.

When his crypto-related twitter activity is not connected to previous market activity, the impact is much more significant. For example, within three hours after his bio change to Bitcoin, the price per share increased from over $32,000 to over $38,000. This resulted in a spike of cumulative abnormal return(CAR) of 18.99% within 7 hours.

Similarly, Musk’s tweet of just the word – Doge – resulted in an increase of average trading volume from about 9 trades per minute to 775 trades per minute within 30 minutes.

“The presented results show that individual tweets can have a significant influence on returns and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies…

While Elon Musk is likely to be an extreme example in terms of influence via social media, there is a huge number of comparatively less influential individuals, groups or companies who communicate their opinions on cryptocurrencies via social media. A systematic classification of influencers in terms of their short-term impact on cryptocurrencies may represent a promising research approach.”

According to BRL researchers, four other tweets analyzed in the study were likely reactions to previous market activity and therefore did not yield such significant results.

2021-02-06,"Bitcoin topped $40,000 in a rally that helped the market value of digital tokens scale a new peak.

The largest cryptocurrency rose nearly 7% to $40,498 today, taking it closer to early January’s all-time high of almost $42,000. The value of more than 6,000 tokens tracked by CoinGecko hit about $1.23 trillion.

The jump comes after another volatile week in cryptocurrencies marked by Elon Musk’s support for Bitcoin and a record runup in Ether, the second-largest token. Billionaire Musk also posted tongue-in-cheek tweets about Dogecoin — a Shiba Inu-themed unit that began as a joke — stirring buying that drove its market capitalization past $6 billion.

The developments provide more evidence of the way the casino-like gyrations of digital coins are seeping into the mainstream. High-profile proponents of Bitcoin like Musk say it’s winning broader acceptance in the finance community. Regulators, meanwhile, are stepping up warnings of volatility that could wipe investors out.

“Investor perception is at an all-time high at both the retail and hedge fund levels,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner with blockchain advisory firm Kenetic Capital in Hong Kong.

Even so, many investors still view digital coins as a treacherous sector. That was underlined in the U.S., where the 24-year-old founder of two New York-based cryptocurrency hedge funds with more than $100 million in investments pleaded guilty Thursday to securities fraud.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is up about 24% this week. The token may be consolidating before heading toward $50,000, which would imply a market value of about $1 trillion, said Mike McGlone, commodities strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence.

Meanwhile, Ether’s eightfold rally over the past year faces possible turbulence from the impending launch of CME Group Inc. futures next week. The contracts may open the door for bearish investors. The digital coin was at $1,683 as of 11:58 a.m. in London on Saturday.","Bitcoin climbed toward $40,000 in a rally that helped the market value of digital tokens scale a new peak.

In brief Bitcoin's price has jumped 8% over the past 24 hours to highs of $40,415.

The coin has increased by 16.21% over the past week.

Other cryptocurrencies are also on the rise. XRP and Ethereum today reached $0.43 today and $1,687, respectively.

The price of Bitcoin has jumped 8% over the past 24 hours to highs of $40,415. The cryptocurrency has increased by 16.21% over the past week.

Bitcoin is now at its highest price since the sudden drop to lows of $31,500 on January 27. That drop followed Bitcoin's all-time high of $41,946 on January 8.

Today’s high price is the continuation of a rally that began at the start of the week. On Monday, the price started picking up from about $33,600.

Bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume today hit $74.3 billion, up by 17.34% from yesterday's $61 billion.

ETH and XRP also up

Other cryptocurrencies are also on the rise.

Ethereum's price, $1,687, marks a daily increase of 1.82% and a weekly increase of 25.42%. Yesterday, the coin broke another all-time high of just over $1,720.

XRP reached $0.43 today, an increase of 0.14% over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency increased by 44.91% this week.

On 1 February, XRP’s price jumped to highs of $0.75 after 295,000 traders on a “Pump and Hold XRP” Telegram group coordinated to pump the price. But the pump, and the success of it, was short-lived. The membership of the group has dipped to 165,000.

Earlier this week, Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone said that Bitcoin has entered a consolidating bull market. He estimated that $50,000 is the “initial target resistance” level.","The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of a newfound rally as it breaks the $40,000 resistance area. There is a combination of optimistic on-chain data points and a favorable market structure that is leading analysts and traders to anticipate an impending Bitcoin breakout to a new all-time high.

In the short term, the $38,000 and $40,000 levels remain the biggest hurdles for Bitcoin. The longer BTC took to break out of $40,000, the higher the probability of a potential correction was imminent. Thus, it’s critical for Bitcoin to surpass the $40,000 level and stay above it in the foreseeable future. Bitcoin has already spent nearly three weeks under $38,000, causing its short-term price cycle to stagnate and lose momentum. On Feb. 6, Bitcoin finally broke out of the $38,000 level, establishing it as a support level.

One positive on-chain data point that raises the chances of a Bitcoin breakout is the increase of whale addresses. Analysts at Santiment said that Bitcoin whales have continued to accumulate despite the increase in the price of the asset: “The whales of #Bitcoin (1,000+ $BTC addresses) haven’t stopped accumulating, while the mid-tier traders (10-1,000 $BTC) haven’t stopped taking profit as its price hovers around $38,000. Meanwhile, the small addresses have been #FOMO’ing back in rapidly!”

The accumulation of Bitcoin by whales coincides with large outflows from Coinbase, which typically indicates that high-net-worth investors are purchasing Bitcoin. A pseudonymous trader on Twitter known as Johnny stated: “There is coincidence that we have been seeing huge amounts of $BTC being withdrawn from coinbase. The first market correction of the 2021 bull market is now finished.”

Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, noted that atop the optimistic on-chain data and fundamentals, Bitcoin is demonstrating a favorable technical market structure. He explained that Bitcoin is seeing a “massive bull flag” structure, which, when played out, could lead BTC to hit $63,000 in the foreseeable future: “$BTC is potentially breaking out of a massive bull flag that would technically send price to $63,000,” expressing optimism toward Bitcoin’s short-term price cycle.

What of Bitcoin in the near term?

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Guy Hirsch, managing director for the U.S. at eToro social trading platform, said that there is capital rotation ongoing from Bitcoin to decentralized finance and other altcoins. The market has become full risk-on, as DeFi-related tokens rally by 30%–100% on a single day. The appetite for altcoins, which are seen as higher-risk higher-return bets, has caused the momentum of Bitcoin to slow down.

Hirsch noted, however, that the long-term sentiment for Bitcoin is still bullish. He explained that Bitcoin was range-bound for a while, which means that it was trading in a tight range. This would change if Bitcoin price secures at over $40,000, Hirsch said, as it would cause the interest in Bitcoin to spike in a short period. Based on the options market data, Hirsch said there is a lot of open interest at $52,000 and $56,000, which Bitcoin could be headed to next. He added:

“I would be surprised if Bitcoin does not go past $40,000 in the coming months. There aren’t really any support levels established at that price because it’s only traded there very briefly. However, options positioning could be a good place to look when trying to find some insights into where professional traders see the markets moving.”

Bitcoin stagnated throughout the past week as the decentralized finance market outperformed major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). Hirsch said that many investors, including institutions, saw opportunities for higher-gain plays in the DeFi market. Consequently, he said that profits from Bitcoin rotated into altcoins, prompting an “alt season.” However, in the long term, Hirsch thinks that the profits would likely cycle back into Bitcoin, explaining:

“This rotation of capital, often called ‘alt season,’ is common in the wake of Bitcoin hitting new highs and is often followed by a sell-off in these assets back to BTC. Short-term, sentiment is neutral, and that can be seen in Bitcoin’s mostly range-bound trading as of late; but long-term sentiment is still bullish, as evidenced by PayPal’s admission during this week’s earnings call that they were surprised by the amount of crypto-asset transactions on their platform.“

Strategists predict a clean break of $40,000

Investors, researchers and strategists at Bequant, LMAX Digital and CrossTower told Cointelegraph that they expect Bitcoin will likely successfully rally above $40,000 just like the explosive increase in demand in December 2020. They believe that the recent consolidation of Bitcoin does not show weakness in its price trend.

Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant crypto trading and brokerage platform, said that BTC staying below $38,000 for a long period showed “efficient price discovery,” which in the past led to a “sharp reversal due to lack of price information."" He further added that once the $40,000 level breaks, what happens next will be hard to predict:

“There is little information to go on since the previous highs are the natural go-to level. But, after that, anything goes, and the next move is anyone’s guess.”

Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower crypto investment platform, said that after Bitcoin surpasses $40,000, it will see an explosive upward movement. Bitcoin saw a similar scenario play out in December 2020, when it struggled to break out of $30,000. As soon as it did, it saw a rather quick move to its $42,000 all-time high. According to him:

“If new investment demand can eat through this wall of sell interest, and Bitcoin does breakthrough 40K again, and especially if it notches new all-time highs, I expect that the volume of these risk-reduction sellers will evaporate quickly, and that could pave the way for another leg higher.”

Joel Kruger, a cryptocurrency strategist at institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital, believes that Bitcoin could rally to the $40,000 level, which would present a more “meaningful” resistance area. He noted that the “current price action is indicative of consolidation in the aftermath of a significant rally,” emphasizing that the consolidation has been healthy for Bitcoin.

However, he was more cautious in predicting the continuation of an upward movement of Bitcoin after breaking the $40,000 mark, saying that “we don’t believe the market should be expecting a meaningful bullish continuation beyond $40,000 just yet.” According to him, the “weekly and monthly technical studies are still tracking in severe overbought territory,” which would suggest that BTC is entering risky territory.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways CME Group is scheduled to introduce Ether futures to its wide range of institutional traders.

Grayscale reportedly purchased over $76 million worth of ETH in anticipation of the upcoming launch.

Ethereum price continues to gain ground, heading to $2,000.

Share this article

Ethereum is going through an impressive bull rally fueled by mounting buy orders from retail and institutional investors.

ETH Futures on CME Incoming

Interest in Ethereum mounts as the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange, CME Group, is scheduled to launch ETH futures on Feb. 8.

The new cash-settled contracts will offer institutional investors exposure to the digital asset on a 50:1 ratio, based on CME’s CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate. According to the official announcement, the derivative product will be open to trade between 18:00 to 17:00 ET from Sunday to Friday.

Given the importance of the event, Grayscale is preparing for a spike in volatility.

The cryptocurrency asset management firm reopened its Ethereum Trust to accredited investors and closed a deal to buy more than $76 million worth of ETH. Grayscale now holds more than 3 million Ether, which is worth roughly $4.60 billion.

The significant spike in buying pressure appears to have had an important impact on Ethereum’s price, pushing it to new all-time highs.

Ethereum Targets $2,000

Even though Ether was able to rise to a record high of $1,767 on Feb. 5, its uptrend seems far from over.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently broke out of an ascending triangle where it had been contained over the past three weeks. Based on the height of the triangle’s y-axis, Ethereum could surge another 13% to hit a target of nearly $2,000.

IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model suggests that the bullish outlook will prevail as long as Ethereum continues to trade above the $1,560-$1,630 demand barrier.

Failing to do so could trigger a spike in selling pressure as more than 200,000 addresses will be forced to sell their holdings to avoid incurring significant losses.

If a “buy the rumor, sell the news” phenomenon was to occur, a sell-off may push Ethereum to look for support around the ascending triangle’s x-axis at $1,440.

Share this article","The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) ordered Commercial Banks and other licenced financial institutions to, with immediate effect, stop facilitating transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges in Nigeria.

The apex bank stated this in a circular released on Friday, February 5, 2020, which also orders banks to close the accounts of any persons or entities found making any cryptocurrency transaction or operating a cryptocurrency exchange.

The CBN addressed the directive to Deposit Money Banks, Non-bank financial institutions, other financial institutions, and the public, alluding to the risks involved in cryptocurrency.

Let’s delve into the details of this strange statement and clear some major pain points.

Advertisement

What are the details behind the CBN’s crypto circular?

The CBN referenced its circular from 2017 that warned people and businesses about the risks involved with trading cryptocurrencies. Then, it told banks not to offer any crypto.

However, the regulator did not prevent crypto platforms from making use of banking and payment channels. It only demanded that crypto exchanges meet Know-your-customer (KYC) and Anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that would enable them to meet customer identification, verification, and transaction monitoring requirements.

The crux of the CBN’s 2017 message is that cryptos like Bitcoin, Ripples, Ethereum were not legal tender, and any bank that performs any crypto transaction does so at its own risk.

In its latest circular, the CBN is basically removing that decision out of the banks’ hands.

Senator Iheyen, Lead Partner at Infusion Lawyers, and President for Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SiBAN) states that if the CBN planned to develop this kind of measure, one would expect them to carry industry players along, and express their concerns.

“We just saw the publication from nowhere, and within the first one hour, we were trying to verify if it was authentic. It was not even on the CBN website before we knew it, they uploaded, removed, changed it, and re-uploaded again. Possibly due to a typo, they made in the first circular,” he says.

This move feels eerily familiar to the SEC’s move to regulate investment-tech companies. The Investment and Securities Tribunal served a court order to a major investment-tech startup, Chaka, and it found out about it like everyone else — on Google newsfeeds and social media.

Ihenyen considers the CBN’s move to be without due regard to existing laws and regulations. Even those previously released by the apex bank.

“The letter doesn’t explain anything; it doesn’t say that this is the reason they want you to close down the accounts of crypto customers which is markedly different from what they released in 2017,”

“There’s no law in Nigeria that criminalises crypto, but for the CBN to deny banking access to an entire industry, I see that as arbitrary, and I do not think that is legal,” he argues.

“The CBN has no right to determine which Nigerian citizen has access to financial services unless there is a law, which would be by the National Assembly, that states so. One that prevents people involved in crypto from having access to financial services.”

Ihenyen explains that Nigeria can deny terrorists access to banking services because we have an Anti-terrorism Act in Nigeria that criminalises terrorism. For crypto, however, there’s no such law.

Why is the CBN banning banks from anything crypto?

As we’ve pointed out, the CBN did not state why it is denying crypto players access to any form of financial services. The obvious reasons seem to tie in with its recent aggressive move to secure the naira, protect people from fraud and discourage money laundering, or just a political move. But, these are just educated guesses without any concrete regulator statement.

Recall that in November 2020, the CBN ordered all remittance inflows to Nigeria to be withdrawn only in dollars. It intended to reduce dollar scarcity and strengthen the naira against the dollar.

The regulator banned fintech companies from accepting remittances and muscled Azimo and Transferwise away from the market. The result? Naira fell as low as ₦396 by December 31, 2020, and is currently at ₦378/$1.

Cryptocurrencies have helped disrupt international payments, driving down costs and speed of reception. With fintech companies banned from receiving remittances, crypto seemed like the next best route.

On the other hand, it could be a political move; an offshoot of the October 2020 #EndSARS protest. Recall that when the CBN ordered banks to freeze accounts of protesters, people used Bitcoin to help keep up protests.

In October 2020 alone, Usefultips reported that Nigerians traded up to $32.5 million worth of crypto.

Ihenyen, once more, points out that no one is still sure why the CBN took that action and raises many legal questions.

Chimezie Chuta, the founder of Blockchain Nigeria User Group, argues that if the CBN’s concern is fraud and money laundering through crypto, it is totally misplaced.

“People have been laundering money with fiat long before crypto, and people still launder money with fiat even in the era of crypto.”

Centralised exchanges like Bundle, Buycoins, and Quidax demand strict KYC requirements during registration, and the onboarding process feels similar to any other fintech application.

The most rampant cases of crypto-related fraud have been tied to Ponzi schemes and dubious Initial-Coin Offerings (ICOS). This part of the market is more in the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Recall that the financial markets regulator released a statement of Intent for regulating crypto where it laudably recognised cryptocurrency as a form of security.

What happens to your crypto?

If you have any crypto investment with any of these exchanges, you can still withdraw your investments as we earlier indicated. Depending on your familiarity with the market, you could also decide to retain your funds.

Some exchanges have already assured that all cryptos are still safe in their wallets.

According to Chuta, the CBN’s order only broke off the branches that connect crypto with fiat money. That ease of access to pay with your bank card or transfer has been disconnected.

What are the implications?

Some crypto experts we discussed with assert that Nigerians would have to double down on P2P. According to Chuta, P2P is the fundamental essence of crypto, and people will have to go back to the very roots of decentralised finance.

“That essence was to provide an alternative form of finance from the politically influenced currencies issued by a central bank. The CBN has only succeeded in delaying the hands of the clock that is ticking the hands of disruption their way,” Chuta insists.

He believes the order opens the floodgates for more informal transactions and decently structured P2P exchanges to flourish.

This will not be a drastic change as crypto trading volumes most bodies report are P2P numbers. Case in point is PAXFUL ranking Nigeria as second only to the US in terms of Bitcoin trading.

P2P exchanges are the oldest form of crypto exchanges. Platforms like Napsters and BitTorrent inspired the P2P exchange model.

Platforms like LocalBitcoins and Binance connect buyers directly to sellers; they hold the crypto in escrow until the seller confirms that funds have been received.

Exchanges later evolved to fiat-to-crypto, that helped people convert fiat money to cryptocurrency. Finally, crypto-to-crypto platforms emerged with more secure channels for transactions.

For years, crypto trading in WhatsApp and Telegram groups reigned supreme in Nigeria. However, this was how several crypto scams were done. If you couldn’t find who to trust, it was so easy to fall prey to dishonest people who collect money but don’t send crypto to your wallet, or vice versa.

In 2020, several more platforms emerged, offering various exciting ways to leverage cryptocurrency in Nigeria. Most of these innovations were the products of strategic partnerships with fintech companies, banks, and global payments giants like Visa, and MasterCard.

The different reactions?

Exchanges: Following the announcement, major crypto exchanges have paused naira deposits, but withdrawals are still possible. We’ve confirmed this for Quidax, Roqqu, Bundle, Buycoins, Binance, among others.

Payments processors: Some Nigerian payments companies have released statements suspending any crypto-related transactions pending a thorough analysis of the CBN’s directive.

Investment-tech: Nigerian investment-tech startup, Trove, recently launched crypto as one of its assets class. But it announced that it had suspended offering cryptocurrencies on its platform.

Popular savings app, Piggyvest, has also suspended crypto offerings on the platform.

Crypto Communities: Some crypto communities are looking to engage regulators and policymakers, so they can define crypto’s status in Nigeria.

Grayscale Investments has surpassed the milestone of $30 billion in net crypto assets under management (AUM). The company says the tremendous growth is due to institutional investors, particularly hedge funds.

Grayscale revealed Friday that its net total crypto assets under management now stands at $30.4 billion. In the lead is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which currently has over $24 billion in AUM, followed by the Ethereum trust with more than $5 billion in AUM.

Last year, Grayscale started off with just $2 billion in assets under management and ended the year with more than $20 billion, representing a 900% increase.

Grayscale attributed the massive growth to investments from institutional investors, particularly hedge funds. CEO Michael Sonnenshein says: “There’s no longer professional risk of investing in the digital currency asset class — there’s probably more career risk in not paying attention to it.”

In its Q4 2020 report, the company wrote that “Institutions are here,” adding that in the fourth quarter institutions accounted for 93% of all the capital inflows during the period, or approximately $3 billion. “The average commitment among institutions is also growing at a significant pace,” Grayscale detailed, noting that “The average commitment from institutions was $6.8 million, up from an average of $2.9 million in 3Q20.”

Grayscale now offers nine different cryptocurrency investment products after discontinuing its XRP trust. The remaining products are Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust, Horizen Trust, Litecoin Trust, Stellar Lumens Trust, Zcash Trust, and the digital large-cap fund.

Out of all the crypto products offered, only three are not publicly traded on OTC markets: the Horizen Trust, Stellar Lumens Trust, and Zcash Trust. Shares of the remaining trusts and the large-cap fund are now unrestricted and sold via any brokerage account.

Elon Musk thinks that crypto could be the future, though he’s unsure whether Dogecoin will be the winning currency. He also warned against speculation.

Musk Clarifies Crypto Stance

Elon Musk has clarified his stance on cryptocurrencies.

In a recent video clip, Musk appeared to address questions from fans regarding his thoughts on crypto. He said:

“There’s a good chance that crypto is the future currency of earth.”

Originally posted by The Hollywood Fix, the clip was taken outside of LA restaurant BOA Steakhouse on Friday night. Musk shared his thoughts while signing autographs for the fans.

He said that there could be “multiple” cryptocurrencies that last in the long run. He also warned about the risks of investing in a speculative asset class. One fan replied, “so, disposable income is OK?”

Musk replied by urging him not to “bet the farm on crypto.”

When asked about Dogecoin, he said that “fate loves irony,” referring to the currency’s inception as a joke project. Musk used the same phrase in a Clubhouse stream last week. During that discussion, he said that Bitcoin was close to reaching “broad acceptance.”

Musk has been known for his advocacy of cryptocurrencies, most notably Dogecoin. Several posts on his Twitter page have helped pump the token’s price, and the Bitcoin market also responded by pumping the asset’s price by 20% when he changed his bio to read “#bitcoin.”

So … it’s finally come to this … pic.twitter.com/Gf0Rg2QOaF — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 7, 2021

To date, Musk’s thoughts on crypto have largely been taken as a joke. Based on his comments in the latest video clip, however, he may genuinely see a future where crypto is used by billions of people worldwide.

Share this article","It’s been quite an interesting couple of weeks in the cryptocurrency market. Somewhat surprisingly (or not), the meme coin DOGE has seen more retail interest than Bitcoin in the US, propelled by a series of events ranging from Elon Musk tweeting about it regularly and the craze surrounding Wall Street Bets.

Dogecoin Searches Top Bitcoin’s in the US

Dogecoin, believe it or not, is currently the 12th largest cryptocurrency in the world by means of total market capitalization. Sitting on a whopping $8.2 billion of total market cap, it has surpassed the likes of Aave, Uniswap’s UNI, and even the USDC stablecoin.

With this said, it’s also worth noting that the cryptocurrency is now more popular than Bitcoin in the US as searches for “dogecoin” on Google have topped these for “bitcoin.”

This is a 12-month chart for interest over time in the United States.

Undoubtedly, the major part of it comes from the fact that Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX is tweeting about DOGE almost every other day for the past few weeks. Musk has almost 46 million followers on Twitter, and even right now, at the time of this writing, his pinned tweet is a poll about the “future currency of Earth.” The results are somewhat unsurprising.

In the past week alone, DOGE is up around 110%. Over the last 14 days, the cryptocurrency has charted 600% gains. This is after it retraced from its all-time high reached on January 29th.

In Sunday’s statement, the CBN said Friday’s letter was only a reminder that cryptocurrencies were not legal tender in Nigeria and was reiterating a position the bank has held since 2017, not imposing new restrictions on the industry.

“It is important to clarify that the CBN circular of Feb. 5, 2021, did not place any new restrictions on cryptocurrencies, given that all banks in the country had earlier been forbidden, through CBN’s circular dated Jan. 12, 2017, not to use, hold, trade and/or transact in cryptocurrencies,” the statement said.

The CBN sent a letter to local financial institutions on Friday, ordering them to shut down all bank accounts associated with cryptocurrency trading platforms. In response to the letter, crypto trading platform Binance and local electronic payment apps like Bundle halted deposits. Angered Nigerian crypto users took to Twitter and other social media platforms to express their displeasure.

The press statement, signed by Osita Nwanisobi, Ag. director of Corporate Communications, goes on to list other countries that have banned its banks from dealing in cryptocurrencies and makes the claim that in China, “cryptocurrencies are completely banned and all exchanges closed as well.”

While China has imposed a number of restrictions on crypto exchanges and users, it has not outright banned cryptocurrencies entirely.

It also states that cryptocurrencies are issued by “unregulated and unlicensed” entities, and that crypto assets are volatile speculative assets that can be a danger to Nigerian users.

“The very name and nature of ‘cryptocurrencies’ suggests that its patrons and users value anonymity, obscurity, and concealment,” the statement said.

In the letter, the CBN assured that this stance will not inhibit the progress of the fintech sector in the country, or its payments ecosystems. The directive became necessary, it said, to protect Nigerians, including its youths from the risks inherent in crypto assets transactions.

“Due to the fact that cryptocurrencies are largely speculative, anonymous and untraceable they are increasingly being used for money laundering, terrorism financing and other criminal activities,” the statement said.

The letter also stated the high volatility inherent in crypto assets posed a great threat to “small retail and unsophisticated investors” who stand to lose a lot.

“In light of these realities and analyses, the CBN has no comfort in cryptocurrencies at this time. It will continue to do all within its regulatory powers to educate Nigerians to desist from its use and protect our financial system from activities of fraudsters and speculators,” the statement said.","Nigerian cryptocurrency: CBN ban Crypto [Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum] trading in Nigeria as China, India, Iran ban crypto-currency trades

For more information you can review our Terms of Service and Cookie Policy.","With the wild journey that is bitcoin price swings so far this year, you might have missed the accelerating rhythm of companies announcing services to support bitcoin for payments.

We’re not talking about small idealistic startups, either.

A week ago, on Visa’s Q1 earnings call, CEO Al Kelly said the company may add cryptocurrencies to its payments network. He acknowledged that bitcoin is “not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point,” but went on to discuss a strategy to “enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials or to cash out onto our Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally.”

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.

Visa also currently provides credit card infrastructure for 35 crypto companies, with the aim of making it easier for users to pay with bitcoin.

In PayPal’s (PYPL) Q4 earnings call this week, the first since the company started allowing the purchase and sale of a handful of cryptocurrencies via their PayPal account, the company revealed that it was planning to start allowing customers to use their crypto balances to pay for goods and services at any of the approximately 29 million merchants on the network, and that it was “significantly investing” in the crypto business unit.

Large crypto companies are also moving into payments. Last month, crypto exchange and custodian Gemini launched a credit card with a 3% reward on purchases. In December, crypto lender BlockFi announced that it would launch a similar product in early 2021.

This is just scratching the surface. Binance, Coinbase, Paxful and BitPanda are just some of the crypto exchanges that over the past few months have introduced crypto debit cards for retail spending. This week, crypto platform Uphold announced the acquisition of card issuer Optimus Cards U.K.

Also this week, Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of volume, announced the launch of a payments system called Binance Pay, aimed at encouraging the use of crypto in cross-border payments. Binance CEO and founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said: “We think that payments is one of the most obvious use cases for crypto.”

Not so fast

Is he right?

Obviously “crypto” encompasses a range of assets, but let’s focus on Bitcoin for a moment.

The white paper that introduced Bitcoin to the world in 2008 opens with:

“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”

Whether Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous writer of the paper, meant for payments to be the main use case or not (this is a point of contention, as he* also wrote elsewhere about its potential role as a store of value), over the years it became clear that scaling limitations inherent in the protocol design made the network impractical for high transaction volumes.

(*I am not assuming Satoshi is a he, but I am using this pronoun to avoid linguistic clutter.)

Another critique of Bitcoin-as-a-payments rail is its relative lack of speed, although this can be misleading. A bitcoin payment will take around 10 minutes on average, and up to an hour for assumed settlement finality. Credit card and contactless payments are faster, but they usually don’t have settlement finality until days later. And data gathered in electronic transactions removes any financial privacy. Cash, on the other hand, is instantaneous and private, but you need to be physically present.

What’s more, bitcoin transactions are relatively expensive. This week the average fee reached its highest point since January 2018.

Source: Glassnode

Solutions such as the Lightning Network aim to solve for these barriers by offering fast and cheap throughput on a transaction layer that anchors to the Bitcoin blockchain at certain intervals. Adoption of this technology is growing, but is still in its early stages.

The existential question

Then again, most of those who complain that Bitcoin doesn’t work for payments have access to other mechanisms that work well. That’s not the case for much of the world. Some jurisdictions have strict capital controls that block payments to other regions. Some countries don’t have sophisticated payment rails that make even simple internal transfers easy. Even some demographic groups in developed countries don’t have access to online payments and are still largely dependent on bank relationships.

For many, bitcoin is a tool for freedom in that it facilitates online payments where previously they were inaccessible. For others, using bitcoin is a way to support the network by giving the asset a broader utility.

This raises an important question: Should bitcoin be encouraged to be both a store of value and a payments mechanism?

Some reasons why it should:

It can be argued that bitcoin’s worth as a store of value depends on its utility. The more there is residual demand for bitcoin as a payment token, regardless of its price, the more investors will believe that demand for it will rise in a sustainable way.

It can also be argued it is essential for the health of the network that bitcoin’s use as a medium of exchange be encouraged. As successive halvings reduce the block subsidy (in which miners get new bitcoin as compensation for the work expended in successfully processing blocks of transactions), miner incentives will increasingly rely on transaction fees.

And current demand for this use case is not insignificant. Binance Research this week published the results of a survey of 16,000 crypto users across 178 regions, which found that 38% see bitcoin as a medium of exchange. In December, Susquehanna Financial Group revealed a survey of PayPal customers that showed 53% would use bitcoin to pay for goods, if they owned it.

Some reasons why it shouldn’t:

There is a not totally unfounded concern that if bitcoin becomes seen by governments as a widely used payment token and a potential threat to fiat currencies they may decide to act, and not in bitcoin’s favor.

While it may seem that governments care more about markets and asset prices, it’s payments that matter for monetary policy, consumption and wages – all things that get you votes. Investments sit there (and hopefully grow) while payments move, and both animal and regulatory instinct is to focus more on things that move.

In addition, you have the theory that if bitcoin is seen as a store of value, it will not be spent. Gresham’s Law dictates that bad money crowds out the good – if bitcoin is “good” money, people are more likely to hold onto it, and use other assets with less potential value.

The endgame?

This segues into what is perhaps the endgame of many of the crypto payments providers.

It’s perhaps not about Bitcoin at all.

Bitcoin is the crypto asset with the least regulatory uncertainty at the moment. Even stablecoins are not totally out of the regulatory woods yet. (The letter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that allowed banks to handle stablecoins could be walked back under a new chief.)

So, maybe Bitcoin is the safe starting point for these new rails. Ethereum will probably come next, and where Ethereum goes, so do stablecoins.

Maybe the banks and payment companies working on bringing crypto payments services mainstream have their eyes on a potentially bigger pie – that of tomorrow’s payments, the bulk of which could run on blockchains that handle a range of assets. Maybe the forward-thinking institutions are preparing for a day when we hold cryptocurrencies in our digital wallet right along with our private stablecoins and our digital dollars and our tokenized GameStop (GME) shares.

Maybe they’re all looking at a financial landscape where the user has more choice.

The crypto payment functions today serve their purpose. They offer a useful service to many, nudge along the sophistication of market infrastructure, and set the scene for mainstream adoption of a range of assets with a range of utilities.

And with more choice, it is more likely that the market will decide whether Bitcoin is a good payment rail or not. With each new service, we experiment with market adoption, and we learn more about what today’s and tomorrow’s users will value. I’m all for bringing on more experimentation.

CHAIN LINKS

Investors talking:

This interview, in which MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor interviews NYDIG CEO Ross Stevens, is a must-see.

Chief economist and managing director of CME Group Bluford Putnam said his firm has begun to notice gold’s waning appeal as a hedge against global political risk, and that he believes bitcoin is an “emerging competitor” to gold.

Takeaways:

Visa (V) is piloting a suite of APIs that will allow banks to offer bitcoin services such as buying, selling and custody, with a view to extending the service to include other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. TAKEAWAY: Initiatives like this (last month, NYDIG made a similar announcement) are a step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. The “endorsement” of traditional banks, while far from the original ethos of the industry, will go a long way toward encouraging trust in the concept from mainstream clients. This could encourage new investment in the space, both from investors and small savers as well as from startups working on improving market and payment infrastructures.

New York-based crypto exchange and custodian Gemini is now offering deposit accounts with a 7.4% APY, via a partnership with Genesis Capital (owned by DCG, also parent of CoinDesk). TAKEAWAY: The “bankification” of crypto exchange platforms is gathering steam. Gemini is a crypto asset trading platform, stablecoin issuer, credit card issuer and now also an interest-bearing deposit taker. The yield offered is sufficiently higher than traditional deposit yields and so should attract attention, perhaps even serving as an onramp into crypto asset markets.

Bitwise Asset Management has applied to publicly trade shares of its bitcoin fund on the OTCQX marketplace. TAKEAWAY: The fund aims to compete with market leader GBTC fund (managed by Grayscale Investments, owned by CoinDesk parent DCG), which quotes on the same exchange. GBTC’s premium to underlying value has dropped over the past few days to around 10%, from a three-month high of around 40% in mid-December. More competition should keep the premium down, giving retail investors a better deal as well as more choice. GBTC’s $24 billion market leadership position will be hard to assail, however.

We saw above in THE BRIEFING that BTC transaction fees are increasing. ETH transaction fees are spiking even more. TAKEAWAY: This reflects the ETH price increase as well as growing demand for stablecoins and decentralized finance tokens. In spite of increasing fees, transaction volume also continues to rise. (For background on Ethereum’s gas costs, see our recent metrics report.)

Source: Coin Metrics

Cryptocurrency investment firm Arcane Crypto (ARCANE) is now listed on Sweden’s Nasdaq First North following a reverse takeover of Vertical Ventures AB. TAKEAWAY: With this, Arcane joins the growing roster of listed crypto companies, and is one of the few broad industry plays (as opposed to pure funds or market infrastructure plays) to have a transparent market valuation (approximately $200 million at listing).

CalPERS, the largest public pension fund in the U.S., increased its stake in bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain (RIOT) nearly sevenfold over the last quarter, to $1.9 million at year-end price. TAKEAWAY: This highlights that direct ownership is not the only way to play BTC exposure. RIOT’s share price has moved up with BTC, but since Sept 30, 2020, has produced a return of over 750% vs BTC’s 250%.

Source: CoinDesk, FactSet

The total balance of BTC held in “accumulation addresses,” which have at least two incoming transfers over the past seven years and have never spent funds, has reached a 3.5-year high of over 15% of the total circulating supply. TAKEAWAY: As more investors buy to hold, more bitcoin is removed from circulation, which supports further price rises as new demand comes in. This type of detail is one of my favorite things about crypto asset metrics – imagine if we had this level of insight into investor behavior with traditional assets.","The CEO of the crypto management firm Galaxy Digital says Bitcoin’s bull market is far from over.

In an interview on the Alpha Trader podcast, Mike Novogratz says BTC is poised to go higher in the next 22 months as big banks hop on to the Bitcoin bandwagon.

“We’ve kinda passed the Rubicon, if you will. We’re over the hill. The network effect of this [is] really taking off… What I’m really convinced of is we’re still really early on the adoption cycle for big institutions. You haven’t seen the big banks come out with their offerings yet. Let me tell you with certainty, they are coming.

I will be really surprised if Bitcoin is not higher this year and higher the year after.”

As Bitcoin continues on its extended run, the Galaxy Digital executive highlights key factors driving the growth of the leading crypto asset.

“Covid changed everything with the macro backdrop of hard assets, and Bitcoin is so well developed, created to be a hard asset that the adoption curve accelerated. Paul Tudor Jones looked at it and said, ‘Wow, this really does work as a hard asset…’

It’s the single largest distributed asset ever outside of the dollar, and so you’ve got this community-building that’s going on telling the story of why it’s important.”

Novogratz also reveals the current makeup of Galaxy Digital’s crypto portfolio.

“Right now, we’re probably 70% Bitcoin, 25% Ethereum (ETH) and 5% DeFi (decentralized finance). That feels to me about the right risk-adjusted and volatility-adjusted portfolio.”

Featured Image: Shutterstock/gonin/MicroOne","Ricardo Salinas Pliego, chairman at conglomerate Grupo Salinas and Mexico’s third richest person, is plugging Bitcoin on social media.

The billionaire with an estimated net worth of more than $13 billion as of January changed his Twitter bio over the weekend to include the Bitcoin (BTC) hashtag. Crypto Twitter users and some of Salinas' more than 840,000 followers reported noticing the change Saturday around the time the price of the crypto asset surged to more than $40,000 for the first time in 23 days.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in December, Salinas revealed he had first purchased Bitcoin at $200 in 2013, later selling during the 2017 bull run when the price reached the $17,000s. He described the crypto asset as his “best investment ever.”

In November, Salinas said that 10% of his “liquid portfolio” is invested in BTC, with the remaining “in precious metals miners.” The 65-year-old billionaire bought in before the price of Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs in December and January, more than doubling his investment. He has said he isn’t planning on selling off any crypto holdings for at least five years.

Salinas is not the only billionaire using social media to push crypto recently. Today SpaceX CEO Elon Musk continued his push of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE). Musk has targeted DOGE users in recent weeks as the token became entangled in a pump-and-dump effort by Reddit traders and investors. The price of DOGE has risen almost 600% in the last 30 days.

Bitcoin hit news highs of over $43,000 per coin on Monday.

The rise in digital asset prices is driving crypto-related stocks to huge gains.

The bullishness comes after Tesla invested $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and said it may begin accepting the currency as payment.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Cryptocurrency-related stocks skyrocketed on Monday as Bitcoin tested new highs of over $43,000 per coin. The rise in digital asset prices came after news broke that Tesla invested $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and may begin accepting the currency as a form of payment in the future.

Across the board, cryptocurrency-related stocks jumped in response. Bitcoin miners like Marathon Patent Group and Riot Blockchain saw gains of as much as 30.3% and 22.6%, respectively, while Grayscale Bitcoin Trust-a digital currency investment vehicle-rose as much as 16%.

Even companies that don't directly deal with bitcoin but have been associated with the digital asset saw their shares rise.

MicroStrategy, a company that provides business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services, was up as much as 16.77% on Monday. The firm said recently that it made large Bitcoin acquisitions amid a pullback in prices.

Cryptocurrency investors are responding to more institutional interest in Bitcoin and other digital assets. While the Tesla news is the main driver of the surge, other institutional investors are also eyeing the token and bolstering prices.

The $2.7 billion, top 2% performing Miller Opportunity Trust, run by famed fund manager Bill Miller, said it might indirectly invest in Bitcoin through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), per Bloomberg.

California Public Employees' Retirement System also entered the crypto fray, buying 113,034 shares in the bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain at the end of 2020, according to regulatory filings.

And even Apple may be in the market for Bitcoin going forward, according to RBC Capital analyst Mitch Steves.

""If the firm decides to enter into the crypto exchange business (multi-billion dollar industry), we think the firm could immediately gain market share and disrupt the industry (while simultaneously making the USA a leader in crypto for the next 10-20 years),"" Steves said in a note to clients on Monday.

Bitcoin had taken a back seat to GameStop, AMC, and other popular stocks over the past few weeks amid a Reddit-trader frenzy on shorted-stocks. But as that trade begins to fade, all eyes are back on Crypto.

Read More: Goldman Sachs says the reflation trade is on, and these 5 market dynamics that could 'shift materially' as price pressures build","Today in an SEC filing, Tesla disclosed that it has acquired $1.5 billion in bitcoin, the popular cryptocurrency. Moreover, the company noted that it may also accept bitcoin in the future as a form of payment for its cars, though it did allow that there is some regulatory uncertainty around that effort.

As the news broke, the price of bitcoin instantly rose by around 7% to more than $40,000 per coin.

Tesla had previously telegraphed that it had an interest in the cryptocurrency, however to purchase such a large block of the coin is notable.

In its filing, Tesla writes that earlier this year it “updated [its] investment policy to provide [it] with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on [its] cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity,” adding that it has the option of putting cash into “certain alternative reserve assets” that include “digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future.”

Under that banner, the firm has “invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin,” going on to say that the well-known electric car company “may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.”

That’s enough wiggle room for Tesla to do whatever it wants with its cash and the crypto markets.

But the company wasn’t done, completing its news-drop by adding that the company “expect[s] to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for [its] products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which [it] may or may not liquidate upon receipt.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made waves in recent days by pumping a silly cryptocurrency joke called Dogecoin; this is something more material. Tesla is selecting bitcoin as the cryptocurrency of its choice, helping to further cement the blockchain as the world’s best known. And that it may accept bitcoin-denominated transactions in the future could help bitcoin retain both value and exchange volume, though we probably repeat ourselves. It’s worth noting that Musk himself has also personally sent bitcoin prices higher in the past using his social presence, including by changing his bio to just the single word, before its price faded back after he removed it earlier this month.

The car company then spends three paragraphs saying that its choice is risky. That’s an understatement. Then again, what is Musk if not entertaining?","Why did this happen?

Please make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading.

REUTERS/Aly Song

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk is never shy of creating a bit more disruption. The entrepreneur’s $808 billion electric-car company, Tesla, said on Monday that it has put $1.5 billion into bitcoin and may soon accept the cryptocurrency from buyers of its vehicles. It’s right up Musk’s street as a wink to virtual-investment, anti-establishment fervor. But it’s also a serious challenge to something mainstream: in this case, accounting rules.

Bitcoin surged to a record dollar value above $44,000 following Tesla’s disclosure. But Musk’s company won’t mark up the gain or any subsequent uplift in the value of its holdings. The reported value can only go down.

If that sounds odd, it is. Like payments group Square, for example, Tesla has to account for its bitcoin holdings as so-called indefinite-lived intangible assets, a category more commonly for brands and trademarks. That means they must be written down in the event of impairments, which include trading prices lower than cost. They are never written up again. Gains, if any, come only when assets are sold.

The current accounting method follows a process of elimination. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin don’t meet the definition of cash, which among other things requires sovereign-government backing. They also don’t fit the traditional shape of a financial instrument. And they aren’t tangible assets that might be defined as inventory.

Yet bitcoin is a bit like virtual cash. It’s akin to a currency, too, albeit volatile, illiquid and issued by an algorithm. If it’s neither of those, it’s a lot like a speculative financial instrument. For those who see it as an inflation hedge, it’s a kind of digital gold.

Right now, the accounting is not aligned with any of those. If crypto investments by companies catch on, that will surely have to change. After all, Bitcoin’s volatile price arguably makes it more likely Tesla’s reported carrying value will ratchet downward, even if the digital asset’s price spikes to new highs.

Imagine a future Tesla with large holdings of bitcoin worth far more than they cost. The company would report an asset value based, essentially, on the lowest trading price of the cryptocurrency since it was acquired. That would be misleading and give managers a potentially huge pot of obscured gains to play with. Musk might appreciate that flexibility. But investors and accounting standard-setters shouldn’t.","In 2020, big businesses and institutions really started jumping into Bitcoin. Now Tesla has invested $1.5 billion into the cryptocurrency and is working on plans to let customers pay with it when buying its EVs. While Apple often stands back and watches before stepping into something new (iPod, iPhone, etc.), I think now is the time for Apple to make its move into Bitcoin/cryptocurrency – here are four ways the company could do it and potentially disrupt the industry.

Bitcoin background

In October 2020, Square Inc. (payment processing app, Cash app, etc.) invested $50 million into Bitcoin (BTC). That was about 1% of the company’s total assets at the end of Q2 2020 (for reference, that’s grown 4x since then to over $200 million at the time of writing). That move came after the Cash app has offered the ability to buy Bitcoin for several years.

An even bigger investment into BTC was made by Microstrategy over the last year with the company’s CEO Michael Saylor putting over $1 billion into the cryptocurrency. And notably, Saylor was likely a factor in Elon Musk and Tesla putting its $1.5 billion in – with what started as a Twitter conversation back in December.

2020 also saw more traditional veteran investors like Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones become Bitcoin bulls.

The big picture here is that more and more companies and institutions are looking to Bitcoin for long-term investment and asset preservation, something Bitcoin bulls believe will lead to more stability and naturally, increased value.

Why Bitcoin?

There is certainly risk with investing in Bitcoin, but there’s also a very big potential upside. Apple of all companies has the ability to tolerate risk, and even putting just 1% of its cash on hand would amount to a $2 billion investment into Bitcoin. Notably, analysis from Ark Investments sees Bitcoin growing to $70,000 per coin if US companies put 1% into it, and $400,000 a coin if companies put 10% into the cryptocurrency.

The bull case here is that investing cash on hand into Bitcoin is a way to preserve/grow cash (BTC has over a 100% growth a year at this point) while the USD is losing value over time. In turn, that preserves shareholder wealth. That line of thinking is based on Bitcoin having a known, limited supply of 21 million coins and the basic principles of supply and demand (if people and companies keep investing in it).

Michael Saylor believes that Tesla, Apple, Google, etc. will need to shift their cash to Bitcoin. Notably, the video below is from December 23, before Tesla made the jump into BTC.

Apple and Bitcoin: 4 ways it could move into cryptocurrency

Apple has been publicly optimistic about cryptocurrency in the past. Back in 2019, Apple Pay vice president Jennifer Bailey said “we’re watching cryptocurrency” and that “We think it’s interesting. We think it has interesting long-term potential.”

Investing cash on hand

So Apple has been no doubt researching and planning on what do to with Bitcoin/crypto for some time. As far as Apple investing its own cash on hand, I think it’s a no-brainer. 1% of that would be $2 billion and would be an easy way to start. It probably wouldn’t alarm Wall Street/traditional investors being such a low percentage and with Tesla and Apple both investing in it, the moves would spur many more companies to do the same. The 1% mark would be in line with Apple’s financial M.O.

I don’t think Apple is likely to put a large portion of its cash into Bitcoin in one move – like Michael Saylor might advocate. But it could put itself in position for huge gains if it moved say even 5 or 10% of its $207 billion in cash to Bitcoin. But with a history of being financially conservative, Apple may make a bigger initial bet on this next aspect of crypto…

Apple cryptocurrency exchange

I think the other side of Apple embracing Bitcoin will be integration with iOS. Major players like Square and PayPal already offer the ability to buy Bitcoin easily in their apps and Apple has been ramping up its financial offerings over the last couple of years.

Of course there’s been some good progress with Apple Pay adoption, but things have become more focused in the fintech space for the company with Apple Cash and Apple Card.

Apple offering the ability to buy and sell or better yet, also send and receive Bitcoin P2P right within iOS could be a game-changer.

In fact, RBC Capital Markets (via CNBC) believes that if Apple jumps into the cryptocurrency exchange market, it could disrupt and potentially own the market.

“If the firm decides to enter into the crypto exchange business (multi-billion dollar industry) we think the firm could immediately gain market share and disrupt the industry (while simultaneously making the USA a leader in crypto for the next 10-20 years),” RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said in a note to clients on Monday.

RBC believes this could mean $40 billion/year in revenue for Apple – that would be a sizable boost to the company’s services portfolio. Further, RBC thinks that if Apple bought $1 billion of BTC, it could create a lot of momentum with an Apple Exchange.

iPhone as a crypto wallet

So far, Bitcoin has been a bit messy when it comes to the public understanding how it works and buying it. For beginners or small amounts, there’s the ease of buying through Cash App, PayPal, Robinhood, etc. Those apps allow you to buy BTC with USD. However, these apps, don’t offer a full cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase and others where you can send and receive as well as buy and sell.

And for those serious about buying and holding crypto like Bitcoin, they do so with hardware called a cold wallet (offline wallet) for the most security. That’s usually a standalone thumb drive-sized device like Trezor or Ledger. But the issue here is that it’s mostly tech-savvy people that know or are ready to learn about how that all works.

But with Apple’s hardware expertise with iPhone and its Secure Enclave, the company could have a huge opportunity to build one of the world’s first secure cryptocurrency wallets integrated into a smartphone that’s easy for users to adopt (Samsung has done this with several of its S series Galaxy smartphones, but it hasn’t been widely adopted and integrates with the third-party Gemini exchange). Apple could have a big advantage by having its own exchange as well as offering iPhone as a cold storage wallet.

Apple recently shared its has over 1 billion active iPhones around the world. That could mean a massive increase in worldwide adoption if Apple is able to blend its security expertise with user-friendliness to allow almost anyone to feel comfortable and confident getting started with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Accepting Bitcoin as payment

It will be interesting to see how Tesla does with its plans to allow customers to buy its electric vehicles and other products with Bitcoin. This is another major piece in more people adopting the cryptocurrency.

If Apple at some point lets its customers buy Apple products with Bitcoin, it could be a major factor in other companies following suit.

I think a move like this is more likely to come after bringing Bitcoin into iOS and Apple investing some of its cash into the crypto. It will involve a lot more leg work with the tax and legal details to figure out. Nonetheless, it would be a big boon for Bitcoin and crypto to see companies like Tesla and Apple accept the crypto as payment.

Apple and Bitcoin wrap-up

The future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are no doubt uncertain, but it’s clear that big businesses like Tesla and more are ready to test the waters to discover what the future of finance could and should look like.

I think all signs point to more companies jumping into Bitcoin following Tesla and Microstrategy’s moves and think Apple should be next as it has more upside potential than almost any other company in the world due to its ability to lean into this fintech revolution from multiple angles.

Apple could stand to see massive returns on investment by putting cash on hand into BTC but the bigger deal could be if it could become the leader of software/hardware that makes crypto simple, accessible, and secure for the masses.

Announced in mid-December, trading in ether futures went live late Sunday, with the February contract registering an opening price of $1,669.75. At the time, the spot price stood at around $1,600.

The Chicago-based exchange has traded 77 contracts so far, with most activity concentrated on the February expiry. The futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell the crypto asset at a predetermined price at a later date.

CME ether futures

CME’s ether futures are cash-settled and based on the exchange’s reference rate that includes data from major cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit and Kraken.

The CME’s regulated ether futures product may draw more institutional demand for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, boosting the recent price rally.

“The earliest traditional financial institutions that bought BTC are already looking at ETH, if not bought already. And rightfully so. The most used crypto network + future of finance + a potential deflationary monetary policy narrative make it extremely compelling,” Qiao Wang, cryptocurrencies researcher and investor and co-founder of Messari, tweeted on Sunday.

Wang foresees ether rallying to $5,000 and higher in the long run. Ether is trading near $1,632 at press time, a 1% gain on the day, having reached record highs above $1,700 on Friday.

The cryptocurrency has more than tripled in value since the CME announced plans to list futures contracts on Dec. 16, mimicking bitcoin’s surge from $6,000 to $19,783 seen in the weeks leading up to Dec. 17, 2017, when the exchange began trading bitcoin futures.

While bitcoin topped out on the same day and subsequently moved into a year-long bear market, ether is likely to remain bid. “The market is now more mature, the macro is different, and there are different players involved,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted last week, ruling out a significant crash in ether.

Wang also voiced a similar opinion Sunday, warning that betting on an ether bear market would be “the worst trade of your life.”

Patrick Heusser, head of trading at the Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, foresees ether leading the broader market higher. “I have turned long on ETH/BTC over the weekend and reduced some DeFi exposure,” Heusser told CoinDesk. “I see no connection to the ETH futures listing and a specific price action linked to it.”","Why did this happen?

These apps differ from regular mobile and web-based apps because they aim to hand users more control over the data the apps manage. Traditional apps, such as Robinhood or Twitter, are managed by a central authority, which ultimately has the last word on how their customers’ data is secured and used – for better or worse.

Dapps take a decentralized approach to data management, theoretically putting control back in the hands of the user with the help of blockchain technology – the basis of the Ethereum network. Ethereum is the name of both the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization (after bitcoin) and the first platform to facilitate the creation of dapps.

While the promise of Ethereum is tantalizing to proponents of the technology, it’s an open-source platform, meaning the projects built upon it are often experimental and sometimes outright scams. Conducting diligent research before investing is highly recommended.

Top Ethereum projects

Right now, many of the top Ethereum projects are focused on decentralized finance, or DeFi. DeFi aims to expand the utility of cryptocurrencies from day-to-day transactions to more complex financial use cases, such as loans and derivatives.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The DeFi space gained significant traction in 2020, with the total value of crypto assets locked in its protocols rising over 2,000% from $650 million at the start of the year to $16.05 billion at the close.

Ethereum dapps have become so popular that the increased congestion has pushed transaction fees – the amount of ether required to send payments over the network – higher than ever. This is a direct result of dapp users competing to get their transactions processed faster by miners. The higher the fee attached to a transaction, the more likely an ETH miner will add that to the blockchain sooner.

MakerDao

Stablecoins are an effort to improve upon one of the pain points of cryptocurrencies. Crypto prices fluctuate unpredictably, making them unsuitable as a means of payment and as a reliable store of wealth. While most stablecoins are centralized, MakerDAO is different in that it has put forth a detailed plan for how to eventually decentralize the control of its stablecoin, dai.

Uniswap

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange, meaning that unlike most exchanges it never takes control of a user’s funds. It’s the most popular decentralized exchange so far. This exchange is a cornerstone of Ethereum’s recent booming DeFi movement, facilitating trades from coin to coin. The project even attracted a “vampire” competitor, SushiSwap, which tried to suck up all its users. Another unique aspect of Uniswap is that it utilizes an automated market maker (AMM) system for facilitating trading, meaning the underlying liquidity pools that manage the actual coin-swapping are run by smart contracts as opposed to a traditional order book system.

When trading on a regular centralized crypto exchange, the market price for an asset is determined by supply and demand. In order to buy and sell, a trader must find someone on the opposite side of the order book to provide liquidity to complete a transaction. With AMM-based exchanges like Uniswap, a pricing algorithm determines the market price of each asset. Investors are incentivized to provide liquidity which is pooled together and used to execute all trades at the set market prices.

Chainlink

Chainlink is an oracle platform, which means it connects smart contracts with real-time data from the outside world such as weather information or stock prices. A smart contract uses that data to execute pre-defined instructions. For example, payout an insurance claim in the event of a hurricane.

While Chainlink has been around since 2017, the project didn’t really come to the forefront of the space until 2019 – after it partnered with Google. Chainlink is fuelled by an ERC-20 crypto token, LINK, and runs on top of the Ethereum network.

Axie Infinity

Axie Infinity is an online role-playing game where users collect and raise digital, fantastical characters called “Axies.” Under the hood, Axies are types of nonfungible tokens (NFT), which means each one is cryptographically unique, gamers have full ownership over them and in some cases have a monetary value due to their scarce, collectible nature.

Aave

Aave is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that recently raised $25 million from leading venture capital firms Blockchain.com and Blockchain Capital.

According to tracker DeFi Pulse, Aave is currently the fourth-largest DeFi app based on the $1.14 billion locked up in the app. It was briefly the largest earlier this year.

Bitcoin has more than doubled over two months as institutional investors search for alternative wealth stores and retail traders ride the wave. Monday’s leap after Tesla’s announcement was its largest daily rise in more than three years.

It traded at a record high of $48,216 late in the Asian afternoon on Tuesday. Rival cryptocurrency ethereum had made a record high of $1,784.85 in the early morning.

Shares of companies that provide trading platforms for bitcoin and the technology to “mine” the cryptocurrency surged in China, South Korea, and Australia, and big computer chip making companies such as SK Hynix also rose.

The U.S. dollar slumped against most currencies.

Analysts figure Tesla’s announcement that it had bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin and that it would take the cryptocurrency as payment for cars is part a of a larger shift as companies and big investment houses follow small traders into the asset.

“While you can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin, I wouldn’t suggest doing so,” said Michael Bucella, partner at crypto investment firm BlockTower on CNBC. “We’re in a position where these are the earliest phases of an allocation to bitcoin from the institutional and corporate community.”

Bitcoin is already up 62% this year, on top of a 300% rally last year, as investors search for alternatives to the greenback because of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 0% interest rates.

Central bankers and regulators, particularly in China, are also starting to embrace issuing their own digital currencies for everyday use, in a major break from the conventional workings of global finance.

“Digital currencies, it seems clear to us, are going to be an increasing part of financial architecture very broadly and potentially portfolios moving forward,” Ben Powell, APAC chief investment strategist at BlackRock’s Investment Institute said on CNBC.

“There isn’t just news in the U.S. with the bitcoin situation, but in China we’ve got a rollout of China’s digital currency with so-called ‘red packets.’”

Tesla boss Elon Musk has long been a cryptocurrency fan - he has talked them up online - but Tesla’s hard currency investment came as a surprise that has put a rocket under the sector.

Even dogecoin, a joke cryptocurrency with a dog as its symbol, has seen its value turbocharged after Musk mentioned it on Twitter. It has jumped by 13% in the past day, according to CoinMarketCap.

China’s Feitian Technologies Co Ltd, which makes technology for digital payments, rose 4.47% on Tuesday.

Beijing will issue 10 million yuan ($1.55 million) worth of digital currency to residents that can be used during the Chinese New Year holiday starting Thursday, domestic media reported.

In addition, Chinese are expected to send billions of yuan to each other during the weeklong holiday via chat apps like WeChat - digital versions of traditional ‘red packet’ envelopes filled with cash. ($1 = 6.4493 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Writing by Stanley White)","Bitcoin took another large stride toward mainstream acceptance on Monday after billionaire Elon Musk‘s electric vehicle company Tesla Inc revealed it had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars, sending the cryptocurrency shooting higher.

The announcements, buried deep in Tesla‘s 2020 annual report, drove a roughly 20% surge in the world’s most widely held cryptocurrency to over $47,000. At current prices, 0.8 bitcoins would be enough to buy an entry-level Tesla Model 3.

Investors anticipated other companies will soon join a list of firms that invest in or hold bitcoin including BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, and payments companies Square and PayPal.

Musk has upended Wall Street over the last year and briefly became the world’s richest person as shares of Tesla surged nearly 500% to become the fifth most-valuable U.S. company, leaving other companies and investors eager to follow in his wake.

“If any lesser mortals had made the decision to put part of their balance sheet in Bitcoin, I don’t think it would have been taken seriously,” said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York. “But when the richest man in the world does it, everyone has to take a second look.”

The news sparked heavy trading in cryptocurrencies and caused exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, Binance to experience technical issues, according to Coindesk

It also generated discussion on Reddit. While discussions of cryptocurrencies are banned on the WallStreetBets community that fueled the GameStop Corp trading frenzy, users in other subreddits posted “to the moon,” expecting more companies to follow suit after Tesla.

A well-known supporter of cryptocurrencies, Musk has weighed in regularly on the past month’s frenzy in retail investment, also driving up prices of the meme-based digital currency dogecoin and shares of U.S. video game chain GameStop.

Experts said they would not be surprised by a closer look from regulators given Musk‘s bumpy past with watchdogs.

The Securities and Exchange Commission sparred with Musk and Tesla several times over his use of Twitter to discuss the company, ultimately resulting in his exit as company chairman and a pair of $20 million fines for Musk and Tesla.

“We’re talking about a billionaire with one of the most valuable companies in the history of the world who has seemingly gotten away with poking the SEC before,” said Tyler Gellasch, head of the Washington-based Healthy Markets Association and former SEC official. Still, Gellasch said that “examination doesn’t mean this is likely to be an enforcement case.”

Tesla said in a filing the decision to move nearly 8% of its reserves into bitcoin was part of its broad investment policy as a company aimed at diversifying and maximizing its returns on cash, including holding gold. The report said it ended 2020 with $19.38 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

“We expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt,” the company said.

Tesla said it had invested an aggregate $1.5 billion in bitcoin under the changed policy and could “acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term”. Shares of the company rose 1.3% Monday.

Gold jumped more than 1% Monday while ethereum, another cryptocurrency, surged to a record high.

Long-term store of value

Central banks remain skeptical of digital currencies, but analysts say the more real-world uses appear for bitcoin, the more attractive it will prove as a long-term store of value.

Bitcoin has rallied as far as $47,565 after Tesla‘s disclosure. The cryptocurrency is up 1135% since March 2020, thanks in part to interest from institutional investors.

“The argument for bitcoin is evolving. It used to be negative (reasons to buy), but suddenly there are positive reasons, and that’s why you see bitcoin at (new highs),” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor of Allianz, told CNBC.

Tesla is the latest company to add bitcoin to its corporate treasury, following similar moves by Square, the payments company led by Twitter Inc chief Jack Dorsey and U.S. software firm MicroStrategy Inc.

Apple Inc may be the next big company to enter the cryptocurrency market, both by allowing bitcoin to be exchanged on its Apple Wallet service and investing some of its own reserves in units of the cryptocurrency, said Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

“If this becomes a trend in corporate treasuries the downside of staying on the sidelines will only become costlier over time,” said Maya Zehavi, a blockchain consultant.

Tesla‘s move to put some of its corporate reserves in bitcoin may be a signal that it expects the cryptocurrency will emerge as another store of long-term value alongside the dollar and gold, said Graham Tanaka, president and chief investment officer of Tanaka Capital Management in New York.

“Companies are very careful when it comes down to their reserves,” he said. “This doesn’t appear to be a flash in the pan. It appears to be something that may be a fundamental change.”

The news comes as bitcoin tested new highs of over $48,000 per coin on Tuesday morning.

Saylor held a ""Bitcoin for Corporations"" conference on February 3 and 4 that saw 7,000 companies attend.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Noted bitcoin bull Michael Saylor said that 2021 is the ""year of institutional investment"" in cryptocurrency in an interview with Ran Neuner, the former host of CNBC's ""Crypto Trader,"" on Tuesday.

With fiat currencies depreciating, Saylor said, ""the simple most value-creating thing"" companies can do is convert cash from ""analog money into a digital asset like bitcoin.""

According to the bitcoin evangelist, there were ""1,000 companies"" that ""went through this transformation"" in 2020 alone.

Saylor, who is the CEO of the business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, has been pushing corporate moves into bitcoin for some time. His company MicroStrategy owns over 71,079 bitcoins worth $3.35 billion at current prices.

Saylor's comments come on the back of a historic rise for bitcoin, which hit all-time highs on Tuesday of over $48,000 per coin after Tesla announced a $1.5 billion investment in the currency.

Saylor and Elon Musk have been linked in the media after a tweet exchange between the two showed Musk asking if bitcoin transactions in the billion-dollar range are even possible.

Saylor responded, ""Yes. I have purchased over $1.3 billion in #BTC in past months & would be happy to share my playbook with you offline - from one rocket scientist to another.""

Ran Neuner asked Saylor about the Tesla move and if there were other interactions between him and Musk in the Tuesday interview.

Saylor responded by saying that as an officer of a public company, he ""couldn't really comment on that one way or the other.""

However, he did call the move by Tesla ""forward-thinking"" and compared the transformation from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles at Tesla to the ""digital transformation of the balance sheet.""

Michael Saylor has been the talk of the crypto world this month after he held a ""Bitcoin for Corporations"" conference on February 3 and 4.

In his interview with Ran Neuner, Saylor said 7,000 companies and around 8,500 people attended the event, far exceeding his expectations for 2,000 attendees.

He also noted the idea for the conference came from ""popular demand."" The bitcoin bull said he had been receiving hundreds of invitations for meetings to answer questions about converting fiat currencies into bitcoin after his company bought into the market.

When asked about the next major company that might move into crypto, Saylor said he would look at ""cash-rich companies,"" including big tech players, saying, ""I think it makes sense for Apple,"" but ""it could be any of the top five to 10.""

Still, bitcoin and Tesla always have their critics. Michael Burry, of ""Big Short"" fame, said on Tuesday he believes ""we are in a blow-off top in all things"" and that ""markets have now bubbled over in a dangerous way.""

Bitcoin traded at $47,344 on Tuesday as of 3:46 PM EST. The cryptocurrency has appreciated roughly 20% in the past two days alone.","Will other companies follow Mr. Musk’s lead? It doesn’t seem likely, said Naresh Aggarwal of the Association of Corporate Treasurers in London. “Gold is probably a more traditional form of alternative investment,” he said, yet few firms outside the financial sector hold it. “If they’re not tempted by gold, then I can’t see them being tempted by Bitcoin,” he added, likening it to “putting money on a horse race.” Keeping money in liquid, ultra-safe investments is particularly important during the pandemic, and many corporate finance chiefs remember being burned in 2008 by higher-yielding investments, whose volatility looks tame compared to many cryptocurrencies.

That said, Tesla isn’t the only company dabbling in Bitcoin. Most notably, the software company MicroStrategy now holds Bitcoin worth about a third of its market cap; the company’s C.E.O., Michael Saylor, held a conference last week that promoted Bitcoin for corporations. Tesla representatives were reportedly spotted there.

It’s also emblematic of the struggle by financial regulators the world over to regulate the supercharged space of digital currencies.

On Friday afternoon, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a circular asking commercial banks and other financial institutions to close accounts transacting in, or operating on, cryptocurrency exchanges. All deals involving cryptocurrency are now “prohibited” with “severe regulatory sanctions” awaiting erring outfits. The CBN also asked banks to identify “persons and or entities transacting in or operating cryptocurrency exchanges within their systems and ensure that such accounts are closed immediately.”

The circular follows a 2017 warning issued by the bank against the use of cryptocurrencies.

While the new directive doesn’t explicitly void the legality of virtual currencies, it goes a step further than the 2017 guidance, by making trading them in Nigeria basically impossible. While the 2017 note prohibited banks from doing crypto deals, it did allow them to have exchanges as customers, provided they met certain requirements. Language in the latest guidance appears to make dealing on any exchanges illegal.

The bank’s position since 2017 did not stop the meteoric rise of cryptocurrency in the country. By some estimates, Nigerians have traded over $500 million in bitcoin in the last five years, making it the second largest bitcoin market after the US.

Crypto’s instability notwithstanding, it provides a worthwhile hedge for Nigerian investors, considering the country’s uncertain monetary policy, currency fluctations, and recent collapse in oil prices. The fact that digital currencies are protected from inflation, capital controls, or exchange rate depreciation has seen many Nigerians turn to them for financial trades such as cross-border remittances and e-commerce. Startups have sprung up to facilitate these trades.

Bitcoin was also used to fund activists during last year’s widespread protests against police brutality in the country, after the government and Central Bank allegedly blocked donations coming through local payment platforms.

“CBN’s move likely reflects an attempt to get remittance dollars to flow back into the official channels to support the exchange rate,” one economist who requested anonymity told Quartz.

Unlike traditional currencies, crypto is not subject to monetary policy, and like several central banks around the world, the CBN has taken aim at the currency’s volatility and opaqueness. These criticisms are not without merit: crypto has been used to facilitate fraudulent and questionable activities, including a 2017 Ponzi scheme in which an estimated 3 million Nigerians lost 18 billion naira ($47 million).

However, moves to have it regulated have been protracted. Some African countries like Algeria, Morocco, and Libya have laws prohibiting cryptocurrency outright. South Africa, on the other hand, is proposing new regulations that protect its citizens from frauds using the platforms.

Nigeria seemed to be on that path when its Securities and Exchange Commission recognized the validity of digital currencies last September, thus providing investors with hope that regulation and security would follow. But the apex regulator’s new rules looked to have stymied those efforts.

Some fintech platforms facilitating crypto-related transactions have complied so far with the CBN’s approach. Binance, through its owner Changpeng Zhao, made an announcement on Twitter asking users to “withdraw your NGN as early as possible to avoid potential channel issues.”

Former vice-president Atiku Abubakar was one of the critics of the policy over the weekend, saying he believes it would stifle an already unhealthy economy. “This is definitely the wrong time to introduce policies that will restrict the inflow of capital into Nigeria, and I urge that the policy to prohibit the dealing and transaction of cryptocurrencies be revisited,” Abubakar wrote on Twitter, calling for regulation instead.",

Tesla's bold bitcoin bet is unlikely to be followed by other major corporates, according to JPMorgan.

Bitcoin's volatility is the main reason that will deter more mainstream companies, strategists said.

Adding a 1% Bitcoin allocation ""would cause a big increase in the volatility of the overall portfolio.""

Don't expect other large companies to follow Tesla's $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase, JPMorgan said on Tuesday.

Bitcoin got a huge boost from the electric-car maker's announcement, which pushed the digital token to a record high of $48,000. But Tesla's 8% bitcoin allocation is unlikely to be followed by more mainstream corporates, according to analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.

""The main issue with the idea that mainstream corporate treasures will follow the example of Tesla is the volatility of bitcoin,"" the bank said in a Tuesday note.

Experts within the crypto industry largely expect Tesla's bitcoin holding to open up the idea to a whole new class of retail and institutional investors. More corporations appear poised to embrace the world's biggest cryptocurrency and add it to their balance sheets, said Paolo Ardoino, CTO at crypto exchange Bitfinex. According to him, all the stars may be aligning for the digital asset, as mainstream adoption plays out in real time.

Crypto bull Mike Novogratz added his take on Monday, saying he expects ""every company in America"" to follow in Tesla's footsteps and allow customers to make purchases using cryptocurrencies.

But the more traditional JPMorgan said adding a 1% Bitcoin allocation ""would cause a big increase in the volatility of the overall portfolio."" Due to Bitcoin's 80% annualized volatility, an allocation of this size could mean a portfolio's volatility rises from 1% to 8%, the bank wrote.

The bank, however, didn't deny that Tesla's endorsement will favor Bitcoin.

""Irrespective of how many corporates eventually follow Tesla's example, there is no doubt that this week's announcement changed abruptly the near-term trajectory for bitcoin by bolstering speculative institutional flows via bitcoin futures as well as retail flows,"" strategists wrote. How sustained the price surge will be depends on ""less speculative"" institutional flows like those in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

Yet the electric carmaker’s backing of bitcoin this week could turbo-charge global use of a currency that’s estimated to cause more pollution than a small country every year.

Tesla Inc revealed on Monday it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as payment for cars, sending the price of the cryptocurrency though the roof.

So what’s the problem, you may ask? Bitcoin’s virtual, so it’s not like it’s made from paper or plastic, or even metal.

The digital currency is created when high-powered computers compete against other machines to solve complex mathematical puzzles, an energy-intensive process that currently often relies on fossil fuels, particularly coal, the dirtiest of them all.

At current rates, such bitcoin “mining” devours about the same amount of energy annually as the Netherlands did in 2019, the latest available data from the University of Cambridge and the International Energy Agency shows.

Bitcoin production is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or between the levels produced by Jordan and Sri Lanka, according to a 2019 study in scientific journal Joule.

The landmark inclusion of the cryptocurrency in Tesla’s investment portfolio could complicate the company’s zero-emissions ethos, according to some investors, at a time when ESG - environmental, social and governance - considerations have become a major factor for global investors.

“We are of course very concerned about the level of carbon dioxide emissions generated from bitcoin mining,” said Ben Dear, CEO of Osmosis Investment Management, a sustainable investor managing around $2.2 billion in assets that holds Tesla stock in several portfolios.

“We hope that when Tesla’s bitcoin ventures are over, they will concentrate on measuring and disclosing to their market their full suite of environmental factors, and if they continue to buy or indeed start mining bitcoin, that they include the relevant energy consumption data in these disclosures.”

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Still, it’s not all eco-doom and gloom, and Tesla’s bet on bitcoin comes amid growing attempts in the cryptocurrency industry to mitigate the environmental harm of mining. This movement could be advanced by billionaire entrepreneur Musk, who this week separately offered $100 million for inventions that could pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or oceans.

The entrance of big corporations into the crypto market could also boost incentives to produce “green bitcoin” using renewable energy, some sustainability experts say. They add that companies could buy carbon credits to compensate too.

Yet in the shorter term, Tesla’s disclosure of its bitcoin investment, made in a securities filing, could indirectly serve to exacerbate the environmental costs of mining.

Other companies are likely to follow its lead by buying into the currency, investors and industry experts say. Greater demand, and higher prices, lead to more miners competing to solve puzzles in the fastest time to win coin, using increasingly powerful computers that need more energy.

“It’s (bitcoin) not a sustainable investment and it’s hard to make it sustainable with the kind of system it is built on,” said Sanna Setterwall, a consultant at corporate sustainability advisory South Pole.

Graphic - Power hungry: Bitcoin's growing energy use

CAN TESLA TURN BITCOIN GREEN?

Estimates on bitcoin’s reliance on fossil fuels versus renewables vary, with detailed data on the bitcoin mining industry’s energy mix hard to come by.

Projects from Canada to Siberia are striving for ways to wean bitcoin mining away from fossil fuels, or at least to reduce its carbon footprint, and make the currency more palatable to mainstream investors.

SJ Oh, a former bitcoin trader based in Hong Kong and a self-professed “tree-hugger”, was aware that his passion for the environment was somewhat at odds with his day job. So a year ago he co-founded Pow.re, a firm that runs green bitcoin mining operations in the Canadian subarctic.

Located in Labrador, Pow.re’s machines run on hydropower, with plans to repurpose the heat generated by the mining to serve local agriculture, heating and other needs, he said.

“Overwhelmingly, I do think there will be a concerted effort by the bitcoin industry to be environmentally friendly,” said Oh, who believes Musk and his company can come up with better methods.

“Tesla is one of the greenest companies on the planet so I’m sure they’ll figure it out.”

Other projects aimed at reducing bitcoin’s carbon impact include that run by an arm of Russian gas producer Gazprom in the Khanty-Mansi region of Siberia.

There, power generated by flare gas - a by-product from oil extraction usually burned off - is used for cryptocurrency mining. The process leaves a lower carbon footprint than coal power, said Gazprom Neft, the unit behind the project.

In theory, blockchain analysis firms say, it is possible to track the source of bitcoin, raising the possibility that a premium could be charged for green bitcoin. Stronger climate change policies by governments around the world might also help.

“It’s not so much bitcoin that is the problem.” said Yves Bennaim, the founder of 2B4CH, a Switzerland-based cryptocurrency think-tank.

“People are saying it’s energy intensive therefore it’s polluting, but that is just the nature of the energy we are using today. As bitcoin goes up there will be more incentive to make investments in renewable sources of energy.”

Some bitcoin proponents note, meanwhile, that the existing financial system with its millions of employees and computers in air-conditioned offices uses large amounts of energy too.

‘OBJECTIVE IS MAKING PROFIT’

However it is early days for such green projects, and some ESG experts say bitcoin could have a tough task being accepted by mainstream investors en masse in the foreseeable future.

“I still think the big players will refrain from bitcoin for these particular reasons - one being very a negative climate angle to it, given the way it’s mined, and two, the compliance and ethical issues related to it,” said Sasja Beslik, head of sustainable business development at Bank J. Safra Sarasin in Zurich.

Some industry players and academics warn that the dominance of Chinese miners and lack of motivation to swap cheap fossil fuels for more expensive renewables means there are few quick fixes to the emissions problem.

Chinese miners account for about 70% of bitcoin production, data from the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finance shows. They tend to use renewable energy - mostly hydropower - during the rainy summer months, but fossil fuels - primarily coal - for the rest of the year.

“Every miner’s objective is making a profit, so they don’t care about what kind of energy they use, if it is generated by hydro, wind, solar or burning coal,” said Jack Liao, CEO of Chinese mining firm LightningAsic, adding that government incentives for miners to favor renewable energy might help.

Others are less optimistic that significant change is on the horizon.

“Production of renewables is extremely volatile, it’s not ideal as a consistent form of power,” said Alex De Vries, the founder of research platform Digiconomist.

“The problem is that the miners that will last the longest will be the ones using cheap fossil fuels, simply because it is the cheapest and more stable source.”

Market Moves

Everybody wants bitcoin, but where will it come from?

The number of bitcoins held on cryptocurrency exchanges, ostensibly ready for a quick sale if the price is right, has declined over the past year to levels not seen since mid-2018. (Glassnode)

A collision course is setting up in the bitcoin market: a wave of new buyers appearing just as easily obtained supplies of the cryptocurrency fall to their lowest levels in more than three years.

Electric-vehicle maker Tesla’s announcement this week that it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin triggered a new round of wagering that more corporate treasurers might soon follow CEO Elon Musk’s lead.

At least one Wall Street analyst argued that iPhone maker Apple, the world’s largest company, should push into the game. There’s also speculation that software giant Oracle might be next, partly fueled by CEO Larry Ellison’s service on Tesla’s board of directors. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft could all be candidates, suggests Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics.

Even the obstreperous CNBC personality Jim Cramer weighed in on Tuesday: “Every treasurer should be going to boards of directors and saying, ‘Should we put a small portion of our cash in Bitcoin?'” Cramer said on the financial-news network. (A JPMorgan analyst, for what it’s worth, argues that corporate treasurers are likely to be turned off by bitcoin’s notorious price volatility.)

Yet, if companies start buying bitcoin en masse, finding fresh supplies of the cryptocurrency is likely to come at a cost, according to professional analysts in digital-asset markets.

The number of bitcoins sitting on cryptocurrency exchanges – ostensibly ready for a quick sale if the price is right – has fallen to about 2.3 million, the lowest since July 2018, based on data from Glassnode, a blockchain analysis firm. It’s down from about 3 million as recently as early 2020.

The decline may reflect the activity of big investors who bought bitcoin over the past year and then swiftly transferred their holdings to custody providers or offline “cold storage” solutions, awaiting long-term gains, according to Arcane Research, a Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm.

“A proper supply crisis is taking place in front of our eyes,” the Arcane analysts wrote.

Bitcoin's year-to-date returns versus the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and gold. Source: TradingView/CoinDesk

Prices for bitcoin are already up 62% year-to-date, versus 4.1% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks. That track record alone might be enough to tempt more companies, investment firms, endowments, pension plans, governments, endowments, pension plans and regular people – especially at a time when bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against currency debasement, during an era of easy-money policies from central banks around the world.

“If you think bitcoin is lively now, wait till there’s a liquidity crunch,” says Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS.

Some 900 new bitcoins are minted each day by the underlying blockchain network, worth roughly $42 million at current prices.

Compare that with the $2.02 billion that has flowed into bitcoin-focused investment products so far this year, based on a report Tuesday from the digital-asset manager CoinShares. That works out to an average $51.9 million per day.

And the CoinShares report doesn’t even cover demand from investors or corporate treasurers who may be buying bitcoin directly through their own accounts, or from retail traders who are looking for a piece of the action.

The math is pretty simple: There’s not a lot of bitcoin for sale at current price levels.

“Holders are not selling their bitcoin in response to price increases,” says Philip Gradwell, chief economist for the blockchain-forensics firm Chainalysis. “If this behavior continues, then price should continue to rise if demand continues.”

Opinions and observations

Has Ethereum already passed threat from Ethereum killers? Sure, other “smart-contract” blockchains might eventually do what Ethereum does, and do it faster and cheaper. But “Ethereum’s immense intangible assets are the real moat behind its dominance,” including a cryptocurrency brand second only to Bitcoin’s and a “fanatically loyal community,” Zabo co-founder Alex Treece writes for CoinDesk Opinion.

End of “Petrodollar” era could loosen U.S. dollar’s domination as global reserve currency, according to Reuters column by Mike Dolan.

“Investors who have grown accustomed to central banks always coming to the rescue could find themselves in serious pain” if inflation ticks up and the Federal Reserve steps in to tighten monetary policy, columnist James Mackintosh writes for WSJ.

Bitcoin to Keep Dominating? David Russell, an analyst for TradeStation, emails First Mover to say: “Lots of people expected a rally in altcoins this year, and there are legitimate reasons to like smaller coins associated with the growth of DeFi. But investors shouldn’t overlook the much bigger trend of institutional adoption, which could channel hundreds of billions of dollars into the market much faster than anyone thought. It’s a completely different catalyst that could disproportionately favor bitcoin at the expense of altcoins. DeFi and Altcoins offer a steady trickle of innovation and excitement. But institutional adoption could represent a tsunami of cash. Risk-averse corporations and institutions are doing the buying. If they’re just now getting the courage to enter a market that was previously viewed as risky, they will favor the safest asset in that market. This is similar to global investors in a new emerging market. They often target the biggest and most mainstream companies like banks and telecoms rather than smaller industrials.”

Opportunism is alive and well in crypto: After just two days, it appears that a website called The Doge Store is already selling a T-shirt for $19.99 with the words “Elon’s Candle” and an image of bitcoin’s price chart (candle view) leading up to the moment earlier this week when Tesla announced its $1.5 billion purchase of the cryptocurrency. By the way, the 19.5% price jump over the course of Feb. 8 was the largest daily move in percentage terms since Dec. 7, 2017, and also represented the largest-ever daily price increase in absolute dollar terms, at more than $7,500, according to Arcane Research. (EDITOR’S DISCLAIMER: We know absolutely nothing about this retailer.)

""Elon's Candle"" T-shirt from The Doge Store. Source: The Doge Store","To chart the trajectory of cryptocurrencies over the past three months, and have accurate information for you to read once this issue of Fintech Magazine reaches your device, is an impossible task. No sooner than Bitcoin, the world’s highest priced and most traded cryptocurrency, surges beyond a new record valuation, it slumps, rallies, and climbs to new heights. Even the news sites dedicated to cryptocurrency values, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and developments in the crypto startup sector have a hard time keeping pace. Swelling numbers of self-styled crypto-influencers take to their social media channels to warn their followers of a coming slump, only for Bitcoin to tick upwards once more.

From a high watermark of $19,783 in 2017, Bitcoin languished in the intervening years at the low thousand dollar range. But in mid-November, it left that valuation in the shade, topping out this January at a new record high of $41,973 - and yet to dip below $34,000. Other altcoins, such as Etherum, saw similar levels of bullish growth on the back of the headline-grabbing BTC activity, while Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, tweeted his approval of the asset. Tracking hourly trading candles, then, isn’t necessary to see the bigger picture: digital assets have matured beyond obscurity, through frothy curiosity and into the realm of true financial opportunity.

From a consumer perspective, that opportunity seems endless - in part driven by marketing campaigns promising attractive, if in some cases quixotic, potential returns. The grand vision of many crypto evangelists is a democratisation of wealth management, platforms built by plucky startups and passionate visionaries, of borderless global transactions, and greater individual financial control away from the governance of central banks and institutional regulation. In reality, however, the line between digital-native, tokenised finance, and incumbent banks and institutes are beginning to blur.

Consumer appetite grows

Cryptocurrency has proved fertile ground for fintech startups, inspiring competition in everything from wallets for storing digital assets, and exchanges for trading and swapping coin pairs, to new channels for consumers and enterprises to realise value from their virtual coins in the ‘real world’. It’s here, creating meaningful utility and streamlined processes to ‘cash out’ from the enclosed ecosystems, where the biggest future developments lie - and where crypto collides with the big players of world finance.

Take Estonia: the Baltic nation once welcomed foreign crypto startups with open arms, offering easily accessible operating licences and the ability to legally headquarter a business within its borders through a ‘digital license’. Last year, however, it stripped more than 1000 crypto firms of their licenses over growing concerns surround money laundering. Around 400 crypto firms remain after the cull, but they face a tough year ahead. Veiko Tali, Secretary General of the Estonian Ministry of Finance, and Deputy Head of the government’s Anti-Money Laundering Commission, said: “A number of important regulatory changes are planned for the services of virtual currencies in order to further regulate the field.”

On the reverse side of the coin, PayPal signalled its entry into the crypto market in late 2020. In the US, users will soon be able to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies within their existing accounts, a move analysts predict will be a milestone for opening the market up to the mainstream. Sophie Guibaud, Chief Growth Officer, OpenPayd says PayPal’s new functionality “could be a major step towards mass adoption among consumers”, a trend that was already picking up steam under the coronavirus pandemic, as interest rates in traditional channels virtually dried up.

Fintechs were more than happy to meet demand. “COVID-19 drove significant disruption in the asset management industry,” says Simon Jones, Chief Customer Officer, ClearBank. “On one hand customers pursued emerging asset classes like crypto in the pursuit of returns as interest rates remain low. And on the other hand, they gravitated towards digital native offerings that offered better functionality and transparency than analogue rivals.” Jones believes incumbents will fight back in 2021, “as existing asset management and investment platforms reinvent themselves to deliver a much more mobile-centric, real-time investment process that rivals the digital natives”.

Big year ahead

The coming 12 months may play as big a role in the future success of cryptocurrency as the past 12 years, the period since Bitcoin was first released. Coinbase, one of the world’s biggest exchanges, will pursue a public offering after filing with the SEC in late December. Gemini, the New York-based exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, who famously tussled with Mark Zuckerberg in the early days of Facebook, may follow suit after confirming they were “definitely considering [going public]"" in a recent interview. Either would be a landmark event, testing both the appetite for crypto firms in the broader market, and as a means for investors to bet on the digital exchanges without directly entering the system.

Collaboration between crypto firms and incumbent financial institutes will also shape the future landscape. Indeed, crypto exchange Kraken recently became the first US crypto company to secure a banking licence. “That could be far more important,” Guibard says, than merely wider adoption from consumers: the implication being that closer ties to traditional fiat currency will remove the barriers of the somewhat obfuscated closed loop of digital trades and limited payment options.

“The cryptocurrency space is no longer just about what’s happening on the exchanges,” Guibard continues. “Instead, the leaders are going upstream—gaining access to federal banking infrastructure and building out new payments and accounts products that will help them address much broader markets.

“Not every exchange wants to be a bank, so we’ll see exchanges and other crypto companies making more use of Banking as a Service (BaaS) integrations to build better products and customer experiences, with a particular focus on fiat on- and off-ramps and wallet management.”",,"Mastercard (MA) is planning to give merchants the option to receive payments in cryptocurrency later this year.

According to a source familiar with the matter, the functionality will see Mastercard customers’ digital currency payments settled in crypto at participating merchants, a first for the financial giant. The company has not yet disclosed which digital currencies it intends to support, or where.

The details shed new light on CEO Michael Miebach’s Q4 pledge to integrate digital currency payments “directly on our network” in a move the new chief, helming his first earnings call on Jan. 28, said will provide maximal flexibility to customers and merchants alike.

Previously, Mastercard supported limited cryptocurrency transactions through its cryptocard partners Wirex and Uphold. But those programs only cover payment, not settlement; the coins are converted to fiat currency well before reaching the merchant.

The new initiative promises to upend that dynamic among the store owners and businesses who opt in. They will be able to conduct their business beyond the bounds of the fiat ecosystem, assuming, of course, their customers have crypto they’re willing to spend.

That’s hardly a safe bet given the buy-and-hold mantra pervading the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The source pointed out most bitcoin buyers primarily treat their coins as investment vehicles, not payment tools. And the source underscored there’s no guarantee Mastercard’s crypto settlement initiative will support bitcoin.

Instead, cryptos will be evaluated against Mastercard’s 2019 “Principles for Blockchain Partnerships” framework, the source said. Released in the wake of Mastercard’s libra exit, the document placed emphasis on stability, consumer protection and regulatory compliance in vetting potential partners.

“Many of today’s 2,600 digital currencies today fail to do this,” Mastercard said at the time.

In a blog post published after this story, Mastercard Executive Vice President for Blockchain and Digital Asset Products Raj Dhamodharan hinted stablecoins will be the primary beneficiary of Mastercard’s coming integration.

“Our philosophy on cryptocurrencies is straightforward: It’s about choice. Mastercard isn’t here to recommend you start using cryptocurrencies. But we are here to enable customers, merchants and businesses to move digital value,” Dhamodharan said.

Relatively few merchants currently accept crypto, bitcoin or no. Tesla’s stated plans to sell cars for bitcoin remains a hypothetical. A widespread crypto economy is still far from reality.

But Mastercard has been laying the groundwork for that future through years of patents around the digital currency space. The company said it holds 89 blockchain patents and is waiting for approval on an additional 285 around the world.

In the U.S. those filings have included: methods to keep crypto transactions private, on-chain credit card payment verification, instant blockchain payment processing and how to handle crypto refunds, among others.

Mastercard first filed a patent for handling bitcoin payments in 2013 but abandoned that effort in 2015. It began hiring a team of wallet developers and crypto veterans in 2019. The company now hosts a platform through which central banks can test digital currencies.

The payments space is rushing to support blockchain-based currencies at a pace not seen since Bitcoin pioneered the concept of stateless, peer-to-peer immutable transactions in 2009.

Visa’s CEO said the rival company may add crypto payments in the future.","Grayscale, the digital assets management firm, announced today that the total value of its cryptocurrency assets under management has reached $36.5 billion.

Grayscale also accelerated its accumulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum as the fund saw record institutional inflows.

Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic

Apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, Grayscale has increased its altcoin holdings with significant accumulation of cryptocurrency assets like Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic. The company purchased 9,803 Litecoin worth nearly $1.9 million in the last 24 hours as the total value of Grayscale’s LTC holding under management reached $236 million. The asset manager bought 414 BCH worth approximately $218,000 in a single day as the total value of its BCH holding stands at around $137 million. Grayscale has a total of 12.29 million Ethereum classic worth nearly $120 million. Furthermore, the firm has ZEC, ZEN, and XLM under management.

Finance Magnates reported in January about the liquidation of Grayscale’s XRP Trust following the lawsuit by the SEC against Ripple Labs and the executives of the company.

“I see the promise of these new technologies, but I also see the reality: Cryptocurrencies have been used to launder the profits of online drug traffickers; they’ve been a tool to finance terrorism,” she said in her opening remarks.

She referenced the Anti-Money Laundering Act passed into law by Congress last December, a part of the National Defense Authorization Act that requires the U.S. government to update its anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws. Yellen said the existing regulatory framework was created in the 1970s and has not been updated much since.

“The update couldn’t have come at a better time. As this group knows very well, we’re living amidst an explosion of risk related to fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, and data privacy,” she said.

This is the third time Yellen has spoken in public about crypto this year. During her confirmation hearing in January, she told the Senate Finance Committee that crypto use in terrorism was “a particular concern.” In later, written, remarks, she softened her tone, saying cryptocurrencies could be beneficial to the existing financial system as well.

Yellen’s remarks come a week after the United Nations published a report saying cryptocurrencies have been used to finance ISIS and Al-Qaeda.

That report referenced law enforcement actions in France and the U.S. Last September, French police arrested 29 individuals accused of facilitating a complicated scheme to fund terrorists using cryptocurrency coupons.

Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it had dismantled three separate campaigns to finance Al-Qaeda, Hamas and ISIS that used cryptocurrencies.

A different U.N. report said North Korea-linked criminals might be using or stealing cryptocurrencies to fund the nation’s nuclear weapons program.

Federal law enforcement officials are also investigating whether or not bitcoin was used to fund domestic terrorism in the U.S., after a now-deceased French blogger sent $522,000 in bitcoin to far-right figures who may have been present at the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6.

U.S. lawmakers are also asking whether crypto streaming platform DLive, a subsidiary of BitTorrent and the Tron Foundation, was used to facilitate crypto donations to individuals present at the insurrection.

The Treasury Department, alongside regulatory agencies in its umbrella, “can better stem the flow of dark money,” Yellen said on Wednesday."

Bitcoin spiked 7% on Thursday after Elon Musk's consistent tweets about the asset continued.

The billionaire also made a reference to dogecoin, the meme-based crypto that's soared this year.

Announcements from Mastercard and Bank of New York Mellon also further boosted its price.

The price of bitcoin rose by as much as 7% on Thursday after Elon Musk posted a vague tweet with a reference to dogecoin and an image of a crypto-themed ring.

The digital asset rose by $4,000 to trade around $48,000 at 9:40 a.m. ET, after it was stuck around $43,800 the previous day.

In his tweet, Musk said: ""Frodo was the underdoge, All thought he would fail, Himself most of all,"" seemingly in a reference to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Dogecoin saw only a 0.8% jump to $0.07, but it's still up 1300% year-to-date.

Its price was further boosted by positive announcements from other big corporations. Mastercard said it would open its network to some cryptocurrencies later this year and Bank of New York Mellon announced it will start transacting bitcoin for its clients.

Earlier this week, the token got its biggest endorsement after Tesla disclosed a $1.5 billion bitcoin investment. That pushed bitcoin's price to its record high of $48,000.

""These are just the early innings of corporate adoption, as digital currencies are beginning to play a larger role in robust balance sheet management,"" said Nathan Cox, chief investment officer at investment firm Two Prime.

One analyst said Tesla's decision was a massive win for the crypto crowd and acceptance within the financial community is what it has long sought - and this move ticks both of those boxes.

""It seems that one thing more powerful than Elon Musk's Twitter account is the financial power of the company he co-founded and leads,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. ""I'm a little surprised it wasn't enough to push $50,000 if I'm honest, but it's surely only a matter of time. There doesn't appear to be much appetite to sell at this point.""

Read More: UBS says bitcoin is a bubble and too volatile to diversify a portfolio, unlike gold - here's why the bank says it could end up 'worthless'","After Tesla announced it has invested US$1.5 billion in bitcoin and expects to start accepting the cryptocurrency as a payment for its electric vehicles in the near future, the bitcoin price went soaring. It went from around US$39,400 to an all-time high of over US$48,000 in less than 24 hours.

The price is now up by over 50% in the first six weeks of 2021. Led by Elon Musk, Tesla’s investment is obviously in profit already: depending on the exact day of the purchase, it is likely to be worth over US$2 billion, pointing to a paper profit of over US$500 million. To put that in context, when the electric car-maker made its first ever annual net profit in 2020, it was just over US$700 million.

The bitcoin price

Tesla’s move into bitcoin comes on the back of a wave of institutional money invested in the leading cryptocurrency in recent months, plus numerous other companies putting it into their treasury reserves. With the world’s sixth most valuable company also saying it might buy and hold other digital assets “from time to time or long term”, it must be tempting for other major companies to do likewise. Since the Tesla announcement, Twitter finance director Ned Segal has already signalled that his company is considering such a move, while a research note from the Royal Bank of Canada has made a case for why it would benefit Apple.

The prospect of a bluechip invasion into bitcoin has caused much excitement among cryptocurrency investors. But if Tesla does trigger such a goldrush, there will also be some unsettling consequences.

Volatility spillover

Tesla justified this material change in the way it manages its treasury reserves by stating that investing in bitcoin will “provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximise returns on our cash”. Corporate treasurers have always used the money markets to invest surplus cash to eke out small yields, and it is harder than it used to be in the current long-term low interest rate environment.

All the same, this is very different to standard money management. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset that you would not typically associate with the cash reserves on the balance sheet of a listed company worth close to a trillion US dollars. As recently as March 2020, the price dipped below US$4,000. Even in 2021, the price fell more than 30% before its most recent surge.

Tesla has put almost 8% of its reserves into the cryptocurrency. If Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter and Google were to do the same, this would translate into almost another US$7 billion investment. This is less than 1% of the total current worth of the bitcoin market, but the signal that it would send to other companies and retail investors would likely trigger a bull run that would make the current market look comparably stable. Some crypto analysts are already predicting that the price will rise to US$100,000 or even US$200,000 before 2021 is out.

Such a rise would drive up the value of the bitcoin on corporate balance sheets to multiples of what it was at the time of investment. Tesla’s 8% allocation may already have gone up to 12% of the value of its reserves, for instance. And if it follows through on a potential plan to keep any bitcoins it receives for electric cars instead of converting them into dollars, that percentage could rise all the faster.

The problem is the potential effect on company share prices. Tesla’s share price rose 2% on the news of the bitcoin investment, though it has since fallen by 5%. But a longer term example is Canadian tech company Microstrategy. Its share price has ballooned tenfold in value in the past year on the back of a heavy investment into bitcoin, but is also down by almost a quarter in the days since the Tesla announcement.

Writ large, this could make stock markets far choppier in future – and vulnerable to a nosedive when the bitcoin bull market ends. It would be easy to imagine that this could prompt a wider wave of selling as investors sought to cover their loss-making positions, which could be very dangerous for financial stability.

What the regulators will do

Global regulators will no doubt be concerned about a potential volatility spillover from digital asset prices into traditional capital markets. They may not permit what could quickly amount to effective proxy approval by the back door for companies holding large proportions of a volatile asset on their balance sheets.

We have already seen the likes of European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and new US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen calling for more bitcoin regulation in recent weeks.

The view from US regulator the SEC will be extremely important, and it is difficult to predict the response of newly appointed head Gary Gensler, who is himself a crypto expert. We may see anything from a wait-and-see approach through to a ban on listed companies holding any bitcoin-like assets.

But I would expect that if the price of bitcoin continues towards US$100,000, there may be a regulatory restriction on the reserve percentage that listed companies can hold in digital assets. This would be similar to the US rule that companies cannot buy back more than 25% of the average daily volume of their own stock. Such a rule would force companies to sell bitcoin if a price increase meant their holdings broke the maximum level, creating a form of sell pressure that the crypto market has not seen before.

For now, however, bitcoin continues to look like a “buy” asset on the back of the Tesla announcement. The crypto community will be watching to see whether other major companies follow suit, and whether Tesla has the conviction to stay invested when its next quarterly announcement comes around. But if this trend continues, make no mistake that a reckoning will be coming over the prospect of the heady volatility of the crypto market going mainstream. Watch this space.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently made headlines after announcing that his company bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC).

The cryptocurrency has been around for years, but it has surged more than 370% over the past 12 months. Even before Tesla's investment in Bitcoin, Musk himself has been credited with increasing the price of cryptocurrencies by voicing his support online.

Because of its soaring price, Bitcoin may seem like an attractive investment. But is it the right time to buy?

Weighing risk and reward

When you're considering any investment, it's crucial to look past the dollar signs and consider the risk involved.

Bitcoin is an incredibly volatile investment, so it's not for the faint of heart. While it has seen an impressive upward trend over the past several months, nobody knows how long that will last. The cryptocurrency has experienced wild price fluctuations in the past, sometimes losing up to 80% of its value.

Between 2017 and 2019, for instance, Bitcoin jumped from around $1,000 to more than $17,000, before it plummeted back to around $3,000.

While all investments are subject to short-term volatility, Bitcoin has experienced extreme levels of turbulence.

In addition, it's unclear whether Bitcoin really is as game changing as its proponents claim. Some supporters believe the cryptocurrency will become the future of global transactions. Right now, however, only around 2,300 U.S. businesses accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, according to research from Fundera. Without widespread adoption, it will be tough for Bitcoin to survive.

Bitcoin's murky future makes it an even riskier investment. Although it could end up changing the world, it could just as easily crash and burn.

How to invest safely

Bitcoin is an incredibly risky investment that may or may not pay off, so it's probably not the best fit for most people. But if you're eager to invest in the cryptocurrency, it's important to do so safely.

First, make sure you have a well-diversified portfolio. The last thing you want to do is invest all your money in Bitcoin, because if it drops in value (and there is a good chance it will at some point), you could experience devastating losses.

Aim to invest in at least 10 to 15 different companies from multiple industries, or opt for index funds or mutual funds to further limit your risk. Because Bitcoin is so volatile, it's crucial to make sure the rest of your investments are as stable as possible.

Next, only invest money you can afford to lose. This is a good rule of thumb to remember with all investments, but especially the riskier ones. You may not lose money investing in Bitcoin, but it's a good idea to be prepared for the worst just in case.

Bitcoin may be gaining popularity right now, but that alone doesn't make it a smart investment. Before you invest any money, think about your tolerance for risk. If you have money to burn and are willing to risk it, it may be worth the gamble. But for most investors, it's best to steer clear of Bitcoin for right now.

The company announced late Wednesday that it will support”select cryptocurrencies” directly on its network at some point later this year.

“Our philosophy on cryptocurrencies is straightforward: It’s about choice,” Raj Dhamodharan, an executive vice president at Mastercard, wrote in a post late Wednesday. “Mastercard isn’t here to recommend you start using cryptocurrencies. But we are here to enable customers, merchants and businesses to move digital value — traditional or crypto — however they want.”

Although Mastercard was short on details about how customers will be able to use bitcoin, the company said it would work something like this: When someone wants to buy an item with cryptocurrency, Mastercard’s crypto partners will convert the digital currency into traditional currency and then transmit them over Mastercard’s network.

This change “will allow many more merchants to accept crypto” as well as “cut out inefficiencies, letting both consumers and merchants avoid having to convert back and forth between crypto and traditional to make purchases,” Mastercard said.

It’s a major milestone for bitcoin, which has slowly been permeating Corporate America after years of skepticism.

On Monday, bitcoin soared to a then-record high above $44,800 after Tesla said it will soon accept bitcoin as payment for its vehicles, and disclosed it had purchased $1.5 billion in bitcoin as part of its cash holdings. Digital payment giants Square and PayPal recently began allowing users to trade bitcoin.

But Mastercard will be bitcoin’s most mainstream, major platform yet.

And Wednesday’s news fed the recent rally in bitcoin, sending it up 3% in trading early Thursday, hitting a record high earlier in the day. Bitcoin gained about 300% last year.

Mastercard’s customers are already using its cards “to buy crypto assets, especially during bitcoin’s recent surge in value,” the company said in its statement. The company said not all cryptocurrencies will be included, and while it didn’t specify that bitcoin will be one of those accepted, it was the only such currency Mastercard cited by name.

“We are also seeing users increasingly take advantage of crypto cards to access these assets and convert them to traditional currencies for spending,” Mastercard added.

Meanwhile, BNY Mellon — the oldest US bank, whose history dates back to Alexander Hamilton’s founding of Bank of New York in 1784 — announced Thursday it had formed an “digital assets” unit that will help clients address needs related to the growth of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, at an unspecified time later this year.

Client demand and clearer regulation “present a tremendous opportunity for us to extend our current service offerings to this emerging field,” said Roman Regelman, Mellon’s CEO of asset servicing and head of digital.

In November, Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of fixed income at BlackRock, one of the most powerful asset managers in the world, said he could see bitcoin replacing gold as an investment instrument.

But others continue to question its value. Last month Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Securities, referred to the recent rally in bitcoin as “the mother of all bubbles.”","Bitcoin prices were staging a fresh climb to all-time highs on Thursday as traditional Wall Street corporations waded into the crypto-asset sector.

On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK, +0.04% , the U.S.’s oldest bank, said it would hold, transfer and issue bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on behalf of its asset-management clients.

That report comes after Mastercard MA, +0.36% said Wednesday that it would begin allowing merchants to accept some cryptocurrencies on its network later in 2021.

The moves, including Tesla Inc.’s TSLA, -1.96% announcement on Monday that it had invested some $1.5 billion in bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.52% and would allow its products to be purchased using the crypto, have represented a growing interest by traditional institutions in the digital asset world that didn’t come into existence until around 2009.

The steady acceptance of cryptos by major institutions was helping to send the world’s most popular crypto, Bitcoin, to fresh records above $48,000 on Thursday. At last check, a single bitcoin was changing hands at $47,856, up 8% on the session, after hitting a record peak at $48,297.35, according to CoinDesk.

Bitcoin prices have surged nearly 65% so far in 2021, far outstripping gains in traditional markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.08% up 2.8% thus far on the year and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.01% boasting a healthy 4.3% in the past 28 trading sessions.

Financial services company Mastercard has given fresh credibility to cryptocurrencies this week by announcing it intends to start supporting payments using them on its network this year.

Many people remain very skeptical of crypto, and who can blame them? The price of Bitcoin is far from stable, and then there's the threat of someone stealing it. Mastercard looks to be taking a cautious approach, however, and being very selective in what it chooses to support.

""We are preparing right now for the future of crypto and payments, announcing that this year Mastercard will start supporting select cryptocurrencies directly on our network. This is a big change that will require a lot of work. We will be very thoughtful about which assets we support based on our principles for digital currencies, which focus on consumer protections and compliance,"" explained Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of Blockchain / Digital Asset Products & Digital Partnerships at Mastercard.

Dhamodharan says the decision was taken to unlock choice for customers, merchants, and businesses. ""This change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets, and help sellers build loyalty with existing customers who want this additional option. And customers will be able to save, store and send money in new ways.""

For now, it's unclear which cryptocurrencies Mastercard intends to support. There are hundreds to choose from, but Dhamodharan expects ""consumers and the ecosystem as a whole will start to rally around the crypto assets that offer reliability and security."" With that in mind, the company is focusing on four key features a cryptocurrency must offer to make it on to the Mastercard network:

The same level of security customers already enjoy from their credit cards.

Strict compliance protocols to block illegal activity and payment network deception.

Adherence to local laws and regulations on a per region basis.

Stability in terms of value so people can be confident in using crypto to pay for goods.

Mastercard already created crypto cards last year, holds 89 blockchain patents, and has a further 285 pending, so the company is clearly already heavily invested in crypto. Now it's preparing to take the next step into payments.

Bitcoin is once again breaking the record price, which is already over $48,000, or $177,000. However, this is not the only cryptocurrency that has recently hit a record high - Dogecoin, a crypto created ""for a joke"", also shot up. At the same time, ethereum, polkadot and chainlink, among others, broke records.

The bitcoin exchange rate has been trading at historic peaks recently. The beginning of 2021 has been really successful for bitcoin, plus in recent days Tesla announced the purchase of BTC for $1.5 billion, which further boosted the price of the cryptocurrency. Three days later, on Thursday, February 11, MasterCard announced its support for cryptocurrencies, which triggered further increases in bitcoin. BTC's capitalization is now a dizzying $893 billion.

Other cryptocurrencies are also rising in the wake of these moves. Several of them have, like BTC, scored record prices. Here are a few digital currencies from the pool of the largest in the market that broke records in January.

1 - Ethereum

Ether (ETH) has been the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market for years, next to bitcoin. Its price, according to the CoinMarketCap website, has climbed to a record $1,803. As recently as December 2020, its price was hovering around $500-700. Since then, ethereum has made a massive rally and in 2021 alone, the exchange rate increased by 142 percent. ether's market capitalization is $205 billion.

2 Chainlink

Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized network, based on the Ethereum ecosystem, designed to connect smart contracts on the blockchain with data - and thus entities - outside the blockchain. The network had its ICO, or token issue, in 2017, raising $32 million at the time. Since then, LINK has become the 9th largest cryptocurrency on the market, with the price rising from $0.19 to now $28. Chainlink's capitalization is $11.3 billion.

3 Binance Coin

Binance Coin (BNB) is nothing but a token of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world - Binance. It is a so-called utility token that can be used on the Binance platform for payments, among other things. Its price is currently $133, while in December it was around $20-30. The capitalization of Binance Coin is 18 billion dollars.

4 Polkadot

Polkadot (DOT) is a blockchain protocol designed to support multiple chains on a single network to allow for data or asset transfers, among other things. Simply put, Polkadot is intended to allow mutual operations between different blockchains. The DOT exchange rate is currently $24; in December it was still around $5. The rise to the current price gave Polkadot a capitalization of about $22 billion.

5 Dogecoin

Dogecoin (DOGE) is a bit out of the competition as it is not in the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies on the market, but it cannot be overlooked. For two reasons: first, it shows that even a crypto created by accident and a bit ""for a joke"", as a token using an Internet meme with the famous ""dog"", can give profits. Second - because of Elon Musk, as it was the billionaire who recently contributed to the DOGE record. The Tesla CEO had a whole series of posts on Twitter about Dogecoin, and in them he wrote, among other things, that it is ""the people's cryptocurrency"" and posting a much-talked-about meme with himself and ""dogecoin"" in the lead role. The result: the price of DOGE jumped to $0.07 from $0.008 within a week.

Tags: cryptocurrencies Dogecoin ethereum bitcoin","(CNN Business) After years of skepticism, bitcoin is finally gaining mainstream credibility.

So if you've been ignoring bitcoin thinking it might just be a financial fad, now's the time to start paying attention. Here's what you need to know.

What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are anonymous and are made with no brokers or intermediaries.

Read More","With social media hype and big investment, the electric car company’s eccentric CEO is betting that the future is crypto.

What does the world’s richest person buy his baby? Cryptocurrency, apparently. Tech magnate and Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted the latest in a long string of social media posts boosting the prospects of Dogecoin this week by saying he planned to keep it in the family.

“Bought some Dogecoin for lil X, so he can be a toddler hodler,” Musk wrote on Twitter, using crypto slang to explain how he hopes his son will “hold on for dear life” to the digital asset known by its logo, a Shiba Inu dog.

But while Musk has lauded the joke currency with a number of memes — “D is for Dogecoin!” and “Who let the Doge out” among them — he has also suggested that the “people have spoken” about the pitfalls of fiat currency and extolled the virtues of bitcoin. Tesla’s announcement that it had bought $1.5bn in bitcoin and would accept the cryptocurrency as payment sent it rocketing above $48,000 this week.

Meanwhile, the value of one Dogecoin, expressed in United States dollars, climbed eightfold, from under one cent on January 26 to almost eight cents this week. Its proponents aim to pump the price up to $1; meanwhile, bitcoin’s market capitalisation is around 100 times Dogecoin’s $8.9bn pile.

Memes aside, Musk — who is best known for his disruptive ideas as the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX — is wagering that cryptocurrency is also financially redeeming in two ways: as a stable store of value for investors and as a reliable medium of exchange that can rival the dollar in everyday economic transactions.

‘Whatever direction’

While many sceptics question Musk’s attempts to bridge two major early-adopter consumer demographics — electric-vehicle aficionados and crypto enthusiasts — naysayers are hard-pressed to deny his capacity to influence demand and shake up the economy.

“Dogecoin is headed in whatever direction Elon Musk wants it to head in,” said Glen Goodman, author of The Crypto Trader. “Its current price rise is driven purely by Elon’s tweets.”

However, the crypto expert doubted the rationale of some of Musk’s recent promotional efforts, including gifting his nine-month-old cryptocurrency. “As if the son of the richest man in the world needs a little investment account for his future!” Goodman quipped.

“If Musk grows tired of the joke at some point, don’t expect the joke crypto to keep rising,” Goodman told Al Jazeera.

Goodman explained that cryptocurrencies do not have revenues and profits on which to base a fair valuation, differentiating them from securities like stocks and bonds.

“Their value is determined by supply and demand for their tokens,” Goodman said, likening them to commodities such as precious metals. “And most cryptocurrencies benefit enormously from network effects, which means they work more effectively if there are more people using them.”

At least two users who replied to Musk’s tweet said they had lost money after buying Dogecoin.

“i spent all of my school money on doge and I sold at a loss. Please Elon dont trick others like you tricked me,” @Skelkjaerr tweeted.

While rapid adoption by a user base and mining community can add security for a cryptocurrency, Goodman cautions that any of them can become “trapped in virtuous circles of growth or vicious spirals of decline”.

Dogecoin has few supply constraints – unlike bitcoin, which is limited to a maximum of 21 million units – but is prone to the same volatility afflicting other cryptocurrencies. Detractors point to the lack of technological sophistication at Dogecoin, making it less attractive than other cryptocurrencies with more innovative software.

‘Rival bitcoin someday’

But diehard Dogecoin fans are committed to their cause. In one Facebook group, Livin’ on a Doge, users eagerly await every sign from Musk that their beloved asset will keep moving “to the moon” — crypto parlance for infinite increase in value.

One Islamabad-based user, Shamim Khokaywala, posted, “Am in Pakistan, how do I buy Dogecoin?” A user in India, Rajat Mishra, responded that he should head to CoinSwitch, an instant cryptocurrency exchange where bitcoins and altcoins can be traded anonymously.

Earlier this week, a user in Lagos posted, “Am in Nigeria, how do I mine Doge?” In response, Jacob Green, a crypto fan in the US state of Georgia, provided information on how to generate Dogecoins with either a “mining pool” of personal computers running on top-notch hardware or “a literal mining farm”. He recommended sites like Prohashing.com and Awesome Miner.

Green told Al Jazeera that Musk’s involvement “is definitely launching $Doge to new heights”.

“For what was essentially a dead coin based on an old meme, it is now being pushed to get accepted as currency in businesses and used for tipping/trading online,” Green added. “It may very well rival BTC [bitcoin] someday and we are all in at the ground floor!”

“[The] future looks bright for the crypto and all who bought in on the initial rush of popularity,” he added, referencing the same meme appeal that resonates with Reddit-driven GameStop devotees.

Dogecoin investor Edward Vincent Fernandez, of Lodi, California, struck a more vociferous but no less optimistic tone.

“It’s pointless if everyone sells right after [the moment] when they have enough to buy a new video game to play while they’re in their mom’s basement,” he said.

“Ride out the dips!” Fernandez told Al Jazeera. “You’re making [chump] change when you can [instead] make real money! Hooooold!”

But even risk seekers cannot ignore the warning prominently displayed in that Facebook group’s mission statement: “Only invest what you’re willing to lose and on your own free will”.

“This page is strictly for Dogecoin talk only,” it says. “Any Dogecoin bears will be deleted,” it adds, referencing the lack of interest in hearing viewpoints that oppose their bullish consensus.

Environmental impact

Bitcoin rocketed toward $50,000 this week after Tesla disclosed its increasingly symbiotic relationship with the largest cryptocurrency. It was good for Tesla’s share price, too: the value of the company rose $8bn, while the total value of bitcoin catapulted by about $90bn.

Yet critics of Musk’s crypto affinity are quick to point out how his climate-friendly electric vehicles contrast with bitcoins that require a huge amount of energy to produce.

Mining for cryptocurrency involves complex computer calculations to verify transactions made by users who send or receive the coins. Complicated puzzles also make sure that the public ledger is not compromised. All of this computing requires massive amounts of electricity to power computers as well as keep them cool.

“Ride out the dips! You’re making (chump) change when you can (instead) make real money! Hooooold!” Edward Vincent Fernandez, Dogecoin investor

Bitcoin is estimated to use more than 127 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, according to modelling by the Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge.

But bitcoin defenders say that the fiat currency system as a whole requires far more electricity to maintain — when adding up the power needs of banks and other institutions whose equipment and employees keep the dollar dominant.

Cambridge University researchers acknowledge it is impossible to know how much electricity bitcoin uses for a variety of reasons, and more data is needed to determine its environmental impact as a whole. For example, some bitcoin miners use renewable energy sources to power their operations. Either way, many newer cryptocurrencies use mining protocols that are less energy-intensive and taxing on the environment.

Crypto devotees say the currencies represent the economy of the future. But ultimately, their value depends on their limited supply and the number of people who chase after them.

So far, Musk’s ability to capture investor attention has given cryptocurrencies large and small a shining light to bask in. But it remains to be seen whether Doge demand will keep barking up its price.","Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency jumped on Friday after interest in bitcoin surged SOPA Images/Getty Images

XRP price jumped as much as 15%, while bitcoin and ether traded near record highs.

Elon Musk's Tesla bitcoin purchase sent it soaring to a record high on Monday.

Bitcoin hit a new high on Thursday after Mastercard and BNY Mellon showed interest.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

The XRP price jumped on Friday as interest in cryptocurrencies surged after Elon Musk's Tesla snapped up $1.5 billion of bitcoin and BNY Mellon and Mastercard took steps towards using the digital tokens.

XRP, the cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, rose as much as 15%, before slipping back slightly. It was up 11% to $0.5987 as of 9am ET, according to Bitstamp.

The bitcoin price was 1.4% higher at $48,129 on the Bitstamp exchange, just off a record high of above $48,300 touched on Thursday.

Elon Musk's electric-car company Tesla revealed on Monday that it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and planned to start accepting it as payment.

The announcement sent bitcoin soaring to a record high of above $48,000. The coin had been hovering below $40,000 for much of the previous two weeks.

On Thursday, bitcoin jumped to a new high of above $48,300 after BNY Mellon and Mastercard both warmed to cryptocurrencies.

Mastercard announced it will allow merchants to accept select cryptocurrencies on its network starting later this year. And Bank of New York Mellon said it will issue, hold, and transfer bitcoin for clients in the future.

The announcements appear to have boosted other crypto assets such as Ripple's XRP and Ethereum's ether.

Ether, the native cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network, was roughly flat at $1,793 on Bitstamp on Friday morning. But it was not far off a record high of more than $1,800 reached earlier in the week.

'Meme' cryptocurrency dogecoin was down around 7% to $0.068, however.

""It does appear that [XRP network] Ripple, like many others, are riding the bitcoin wave,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda.

""Although it is significantly outperforming so far today. It does have a lot of lost ground to make up, so perhaps that may explain why it's being targeted.

""There doesn't seem to be much else behind the moves which should always be a concern, but that doesn't mean it can't make significantly more gains, as we've so often seen.""

The Ripple network's cryptocurrency is wildly volatile. XRP soared and crashed in early February when a Reddit-organized buy-and-hold scheme appeared to fall apart after the price touched $0.74.

Theoretically and legally, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are not money despite what some people may think. Money serves three functions: it is a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value.

Not many goods and services are priced in and settled by bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies). Bitcoin is not universally accepted as a unit of account and a means of payment. Granted, many cryptocurrency payment apps have been created in recent years to promote its use. But none of them has made it to the core of the world’s daily transactions and payments [1], except for some underworld transactions.

Crucially, cryptos are priced in USD (or other fiat currencies). So they are no different from any item priced in USD standing on the opposite side of money in a transaction. Veteran bitcoin investor Mark Cuban summarised it succinctly when he said:

“For cryptocurrency to be money, it (bitcoin) would have to be so easy to use it’s a no-brainer. It would have to be completely friction-free and understandable by everybody first. So easy, in fact, that grandma could do it”.[2]

To legally qualify as money, a means of payment must be granted a status by a country’s laws as its official monetary unit. This legal tender status allows debtors to pay their obligations/liabilities by transferring them to creditors as recognised and approved by law.

Recent research found that 80% of the world’s central banks were either not allowed to issue digital currency under the existing laws, or their legal frameworks are ambiguous and do not clearly permit them to do so [3]. China, however, passed a law in 2020 allowing its central bank to issue a digital currency [4], hence the birth of the world’s first official digital currency, the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) [5]. Despite being digital, DCEP is strictly speaking not a cryptocurrency.

Legal tender status is usually given to means of payment that can be easily transferred and used by the population in daily life. To use bitcoin, or cryptocurrencies, a digital infrastructure including computers, smartphones, internet networks and connectivity must be in place. This condition makes it unrealistic for cryptocurrencies to become money. It echoes Mark Cuban’s argument against bitcoin as money.

Bitcoin is a vehicle for speculators

Bitcoin supporters say it is an investible asset. Investible, yes (in the speculative sense, in my view). Asset, I am not sure.

There is an income stream associated with a financial asset. Granted, there are assets with a zero yield such as commodities, but they are traded because they have a practical use (for production or consumption). Crypto­currencies have neither an income stream nor a practical use.

The fact that they command a price and are tradable suggests that speculation would be their single most important ‘raison d’être’. Hence crypto prices are subject to violent and random movement. This brings up the other problem, store of value.

Bitcoin is not a store of value

For something to serve as a store of value, it has to be liquid, universally accepted, and have a stable value. Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin certainly do not have any of these characteristics.

Bitcoin trading suffers from illiquidity and manipulation because of the existence of “whale wallets” (wallets holding disproportionately large amounts of bitcoins).

In late 2020, the top 100 wallets were estimated to own 13% of total bitcoin supply (6) with most of the owners’ identities not known. It would therefore only take a few whale wallets to manipulate the bitcoin market, causing violent price moves. Huge price volatility has made bitcoin and cryptocurrencies unsuitable as store of value vehicles.

Fixed supply is a problem, not necessarily a benefit

Contrary to the conventional wisdom that the finite supply of bitcoins and cryptos is a benefit and protects value, it is in fact a big problem for them being considered as money.

The maximum number of bitcoins that can ever be mined is 21 million. At the time of writing, there are already 18.6 million bitcoins in circulation. The last bitcoin would be mined in 2040. All cryptocurrencies have a finite supply and the speed at which they can be increased is uncertain and not controllable by anyone.

These supply limitations make cryptocurrencies unsuitable as legal tender because the static 'money supply' would deprive central banks of the ability to conduct countercyclical policy.

However, crypto promoters have capitalised on wide­spread fear and distrust of fiat money arising from post-Global-Financial-Crisis (GFC) monetisation. They have skillfully twisted this supply problem into an argument for cryptocurrencies as a hedge against doomsday scenarios. I believe this is wrong.

What next?

China, which used to be the largest crypto mining country, has seen through the smoke and mirrors and has cracked down on trading and mining without reservation. This shows how quickly regulators could destroy the freewheeling, decentralised crypto market. China instead has created an official DCEP with centralised control.

What crypto aficionados do not appear to understand is that countries will take steps to protect their monetary systems and currencies and their ability to tax and manage the economy. The more people believe cryptocurrencies are money, the greater the risk of government intervention in this market. The emerging trend of official digital currencies is a sign of central banks fighting back.

The popular narrative that bitcoin’s finite supply guarantees its value can play into concerns over central bank quantitative easing and what these QE programmes might mean for fiat money. Thus, the rise of cryptocurrencies can be seen as reflecting the anti-establishment movements in many countries since the 2008 GFC.

Viewed positively, this 'crypto protest' could prompt governments to change their economic management to become more responsible and regain trust and credibility. Time will tell.

I believe crypto prices will eventually crash. This could be triggered by a shift in monetary policy or regulations. Alternatively, a crash could simply occur because prices are so inflated that much like the Dutch tulip mania, marginal buyers are priced out of the market, leading to a self-feeding process of liquidation and falling prices when leveraged investors start to sell.

For this reason, services for portfolio transactions, liquidation and conservation on behalf of funds invested in emerging markets may carry greater risk.","New York (CNN Business) Bitcoin's big week got bigger with an announcement from rapper Jay Z and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey that the pair are establishing a bitcoin development fund.

Dorsey tweeted the news Friday, writing that they are taking applications for a ""blind irrevocable trust"" focused on Africa and India. He promises the fund will have ""zero direction"" from himself and Jay Z and that the partners are searching for three board members. Dorsey and Jay Z are investing 500 bitcoin into the project, currently worth roughly $23 million.

Bitcoin is already in Dorsey's portfolio. His other company, Square, bought 4,709 bitcoins in October 2020, equal to $50 million at the time. In 2018, the company expanded its mobile payment service Cash App to support bitcoin trading, even for users without a bank account. And in 2019 it launched Square Crypto, which awards grants to bitcoin developers and designers.

Also this week, a Twitter executive said in an interview that the company is reviewing other new uses of the digital currency, including employee pay.

Here's what else happened in bitcoin this week:

Tesla's big bet

Tesla TSLA The most valuable car company on the stock market,, announced on Monday that it is holding some of its cash in bitcoin rather than traditional currency and might soon accept the cryptocurrency as payment for its cars.

In its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla said that it expects ""to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future ... which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.""

That news followed the revelation that the automaker is holding $1.5 billion in bitcoin on its balance sheet as part of a move to ""invest a portion of [the company's] cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets."" Tesla lists $19 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of December 31.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has lately been signaling interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In a December 20 tweet, he said that ""Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money,"" suggesting his belief that it is perhaps less ""bs"" than traditional government-backed currencies.

Mastercard jumps in

The credit card company is bringing bitcoin to the checkout counter, announcing Wednesday that it will support ""select cryptocurrencies"" directly on its network at some point later this year.

Mastercard MA Althoughwas short on specifics, the company said the process might work something like this: When a customer wants to buy an item with bitcoin, Mastercard's crypto partners will convert the digital currency into traditional currency and transmit the funds over Mastercard's network.

This change ""will allow many more merchants to accept crypto"" as well as ""cut out inefficiencies, letting both consumers and merchants avoid having to convert back and forth between crypto and traditional [currency] to make purchases,"" Mastercard said.

Bitcoin comes to America's oldest bank

BNY Mellon -- America's oldest bank -- which dates back to Alexander Hamilton's founding of the Bank of New York in 1784 -- announced Thursday it formed a ""digital assets"" unit. It will begin helping clients address needs related to the growth of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, at an unspecified date later this year.

Client demand and clearer regulation ""present a tremendous opportunity for us to extend our current service offerings to this emerging field,"" said Roman Regelman, Mellon's CEO of asset servicing.

Bitcoin is becoming an ""alternative asset""

""As more and more companies start accepting bitcoin, this will only lead to further increases in demand in a market which is limited in supply,"" wrote Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets, in a note to clients.

""Bitcoin is becoming an alternative asset,"" said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies. ""It's not correlated to anything else in the market."" And that makes it an attractive asset to add to a portfolio, he added.

That's pretty bullish for the long-term bitcoin outlook, even as some, notably Bank of America, have called the crypto rally ""the mother of all bubbles.""

Despite the technology being decentralized — with no government, company or person controlling it — the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is cracking down on the trade of cryptocurrencies.

Last Friday, the CBN instructed commercial banks and other financial institutions to close accounts involved in transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges.

Before the ban was introduced, Enogieru Osasenaga invested 100,000 naira (€216, $263) in Bitcoin, the world's first decentralized digital currency. A week later, its value had doubled.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweets regularly about cryptos. Bitcoin pumped nearly 15% on the news that Tesla invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency

Dollar shortage and excessive controls

Osasenaga showed me on his phone just how much the trade-in digital currencies has recently risen.

He said the crypto ban had taken a significant toll on his business.

""I'm unable to receive and send payments or procure electronic gadgets online. Because, of course, again, I cannot exceed the $100 limit on my naira debit card,"" Osasenaga told DW.

Tech-savvy young Africans are often looking to make money, making them more likely to venture into the world of cryptos

The CBN also asked banks to identify ""persons and entities"" operating cryptocurrencies within their systems.

Since July 2020, Nigerian banks have reduced the amount customers can spend abroad using debit cards.

Africa's giant economy faces dollar shortages due to the sharp fall in oil prices, Nigeria's main export.

Local banks now restrict transactions with hard currency — mostly limiting customers to withdraw less than $100.

That's why Osasenaga looked for a way to circumnavigate the restrictions set by financial institutions.

Behind the ban

The CBN doesn't clearly state its reasons for the crackdown. Shuaibu Idris, managing consultant at Time-Line Consult, suspects the CBN had foreseen a potential crisis in the digital currency trade.

He said there was about $4 billion of assets embedded in cryptocurrencies in Nigeria.

""If the owners of these assets reside in China, Singapore, India, US, or Kenya come and take this money, what will happen to the economy of Nigeria? There will be a systemic collapse,"" Idris told DW.

""Then there's a potential systemic collapse arising from the price sensitivity that is exceptionally high with Bitcoin,"" he added.

Alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum is another crypocurrency platform growing in popularity in Africa

Cat-and-mouse race

It's not the first time the CBN tried to control cryptocurrency trade.

In 2017, it released a similar secular, but it did not stop the cryptocurrencies' popularity in the West African nation.

Since then, Bitcoin trade volume in Nigeria has increased by at least 19% annually.

Estimates show that Nigerians have traded nearly $600 million in Bitcoin in the last five years, making it the second-largest Bitcoin market after the United States.

Idris doesn't believe the Central Bank of Nigeria can control how people trade digital currencies, no matter how many tough regulatory measures are introduced.

""We are having an enormous amount of currency restriction. People who want to trade are not able to buy dollars or foreign exchange to import the items,"" Idris said, adding that is the reason people have turned to cryptocurrency to remedy the problem.

""It's like a cat-and-mouse race.""

The Nigerian economist said the number of so-called informal businesses in Nigeria numbered almost twice that of registered businesses, and billions of dollars were in circulation without the government's knowledge.

The recent ban will most likely make the situation worse and lead to a further fall in revenues.

Osasenaga said he and other cryptocurrency enthusiasts will find a way around the ban.

""It's going to be around a couple of days or a week to circumvent this policy,"" Osasenaga said, adding that ""we don't necessarily have to use banks, and at the end of the day, it's the banks' loss.""","Miami Mayor Francis Suarez praised the city's governing commission for passing a resolution Thursday that will study the feasibility of paying employees in bitcoin, as well as allowing residents to pay fees and taxes in bitcoin.

""I want to thank the city of Miami commissioners for supporting my resolution, which directs the city manager, after analysis, to procure a vendor to be able to offer our employees to get a percentage of their salary in bitcoin, allows our residents to pay for fees in Bitcoin... [and allows] for taxes to be paid in bitcoin,"" Suarez said in a video Thursday night.

“It’s wonderful to be a very ‘crypto-forward’ city in the city of Miami, and I want to thank my commission colleagues for allowing that to happen.""

TESLA WALKS TIGHTROPE WITH BITCOIN INVESTMENT

The City Commission voted 4-1 to pass the resolution, which would also encourage the Florida state legislature to pass laws to allow Miami to invest some of its treasury in bitcoin.

""The whole concept of Bitcoin is to democratize a currency,"" Ken Russell, Vice Chairman of the Miami City Commission, said during the city hall meeting on Thursday. ""It has become a currency for the wealthy. I think this is our chance to, in an intelligent way, to really try to bring this to our residents and our employees, but we have to do so carefully so they can make informed decisions.""

Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptocurrency, hit an all-time high of $48,912 this week, but it is still prone to wild price swings.

CRYPTOCURRENCIES NOW 'PRICELESS' WITH MASTERCARD

Despite those swings, Miami's adoption of bitcoin is the latest signal that it is going mainstream.

Andrew Yang, who is running for Mayor of New York City, said Thursday that if elected, he would ""invest in making the city a hub for [bitcoin] and other cryptocurrencies.""

BNY Mellon, the oldest bank in America, announced Thursday that it will create an ""integrated service for digital assets"" this year that will process bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for clients.

2021-02-13,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) abysmal December 2017 futures launch quickly fell short of investors expectations and even though the CME BTC market has surpassed $2.5 billion in open interest, the initial launch has reinforced the narrative that this week’s CME ETH futures launch will be equally bearish in the short term.

Prior to the CME BTC futures launch, Bitcoin had already gained 1,900% for the year, a rally which some analysts argue was propelled by the expectation of regulated futures.

Now that the CME ETH futures have launched, investors are watching closely to see if Ether (ETH) will face a similar situation as it has already gained 600% over the past year.

To date, there is no way to estimate how Bitcoin would have fared without the existence of the CME and CBOE futures. Nevertheless, traders still tend to connect the CME launch to the 70% crash in BTC price that occurred in the first 3 months following the launch.

Analyzing an assortment of commodities and FX contract launches over the past two decades might provide a better perspective on the matter so we will review data from the CME's historical first trade dates index to see if there is a discernible price trend that occurs after CME listings.

Crude palm oil

When crude palm oil futures launched at CME in May 2010, they did not affect its ongoing price recovery as the above data indicates. Similar contracts had already existed for nearly a decade at NYMEX, thus the above event might have held lesser importance as both exchanges handle institutional clients.

Multiple factors could have caused palm oil prices to hike after the CME launch, including WTI oil's 23% positive performance over the next five months.

South Korean won

On a similar tone, the South Korean won futures listed in September 2006 and in this instance the launch did appear to have an immediate impact on price.

South Korean won / USD spot prices. Source: TradingView

Despite not having a futures contract, Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDF) for the South Korean won already existed ahead of the CME listing. These NDF contracts are usually traded over-the-counter (OTC) and are seldomly transferable between investors. This means that the listed futures contract had a broader number of institutions that might take part.

Once again, it is impossible to estimate whether this futures contract launch had an immediate impact on price. It’s possible that the South Korean won devaluation followed the trend of emerging or Asian economies. Therefore, pinning this movement to CME futures launch seems a stretch.

How did commodities fare?

Both Ether and Bitcoin are usually considered scarce digital commodities, thus it makes sense to compare it against other previous CME launches.

Going back to commodities, Diammonium phosphate (DAP), a widely used fertilizer, held its CME futures contracts debut in June 2004.

Diammonium phosphate (DAP) spot prices. Source: Worldbank.org

Prior to the CME launch, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) held these contracts since 1991. Nevertheless, there’s potential evidence of a price dump ahead of the listing. However, for those analyzing a broader time frame, the listing itself seemed like a price catalyst rather than something negative.

South African coal futures

Coal futures started trading in July 2001 at CME, and unlike the previously discussed examples, it did not have a listed proxy on other exchanges. Similar to Bitcoin, a 50% hike occurred over the year and a half that preceded its debut.

The result mimics Bitcoin's listing, as the commodity dropped 33% during the next twelve months.

To conclude, there is no set trend which allows anlayts to predict an assets performance after a CME listing. Multiple historical events have been lined up, and a concrete pattern has not been found.

Not every futures contract gathers relevant liquidity and the CBOE Bitcoin futures delisting proves this point.

At this point, it’s safe to conclude that Ether’s future price performance will depend on a range of factors like the performance of Eth2 and its crucial role in the DeFi sector.

Moving forward, iOS users will be able to add their BitPay cards directly to their Apple Waller or Apple Pay account. Doing so makes it possible to spend Bitcoin at any store that accepts Apple Pay and Mastercard Debit.

BitPay CEO Stephan Pair said in a statement, “We have thousands of BitPay Wallet app customers using the BitPay card. Adding Apple Pay and soon Google Samsung Pay makes it easy and convenient to use the BitPay Card in more places.”

Regarding the latter part of Pair’s comment, BitPay has plans to start supporting non-iOS wallets in the near future. The company aims to support both Google Pay and Samsung Pay as soon as March.

It’s also worth noting that BitPay isn’t just for Bitcoin. Users will also be able to use other cryptocurrencies, like Ether and Bitcoin Cash alongside stable coins like USD Coin, Gemini Dollar, and more, according to CNET. Sadly, and unlike Elon Musk, it doesn’t support Dogecoin.

Apple Coin

Given the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, it’s no surprise that massive companies like Apple and Facebook have considered launching coins of their own or at least an exchange to support other cryptos.

While Facebook has run into a number of difficulties with launching its Libra cryptocurrency, analysts believe that Apple could have better luck.

RBC Capital Markets claimed last week that Apple could bring in an additional $40 billion in revenue by launching its own cryptocurrency exchange. Given the company’s massive fanbase and technical prowess, this certainly is in the realm of possibility.

Even so, launching a crypto exchange is a huge undertaking. Apple would need to be all-in on the initiative before doing so. That may or may not happen in the years to come depending on what direction cryptocurrencies go. For now, adding Bitcoin support to Apple Pay and Apple Wallet is a good start.","Georgia-based crypto payment service provider BitPay is enabling access to Bitcoin and other digital assets for Apple Pay users.

In a press release, the payments startup announces that BitPay Prepaid Mastercard holders will now be able to plug into Apple Wallet and spend their crypto with Apple Pay.

Through Apple Pay, BitPay users will be able to make purchases online, in-store, and on apps.

BitPay CEO Stephen Pair adds that the firm intends to integrate with Google and Samsung Pay in the future.

“We have thousands of BitPay Wallet app customers using the BitPay Card who are always looking for new places and ways to spend their crypto. Adding Apple Pay and soon Google and Samsung Pay makes it easy and convenient to use the BitPay Card in more places from day-to-day items to luxury purchases.”

Founded in 2011, the payment service provider aims to expand its crypto services through its BitPay Wallet app, which offers users the ability to buy and store digital assets and instantly convert them into fiat currency.

The BitPay Wallet app currently supports Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum (ETH) as well as stablecoins USDC, GUSD, PAX and BUSD.

Though users could not directly pay with crypto through Apple Pay up until now, in December 2020, crypto startup Lumi introduced a feature in its iOS wallet which allows users to buy crypto assets through Apple’s popular payments function.

Follow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram","If you’re an Apple Pay user looking to cash out of your Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies after the recent surge, then BitPay just made it a whole lot easier.

The firm, which claims to be the world’s biggest cryptocurrency payment service provider, has just announced that its PrePaid Mastercard can now be added to your Apple Wallet for easy spending in stores and online via Apple Pay.

With the card and its new Apple Pay integration, customers can instantly convert their cryptocurrency into dollars, which can then be used to pay for anything anywhere that Mastercard debit cards are accepted, which is most places. Users with the latest version of the BitPay app (12.1.0) should be able to add their card to their Apple Wallet right away.

Although by far the most prominent, Bitcoin isn’t the only currency supported by BitPay, and customers can use Apple Pay to cash in their Ether, Bitcoin Cash, USD Coin, Gemini Dollar, Paxos Standard and Binance USD.

If you’re not in the Apple ecosystem, you haven’t been forgotten. The company says that it has plans to add the BitPay card to both Google Pay and Samsung Pay by the end of next month.

“We have thousands of BitPay Wallet app customers using the BitPay Card,” said BitPay CEO Stephen Pair. “Adding Apple Pay and soon Google and Samsung Pay makes it easy and convenient to use the BitPay Card in more places from day-to-day items to luxury purchases.”

It’s certainly appealing to people with plenty of cryptocurrency in their wallets, though with Bitcoin rising to a record high of over $48,000 yesterday, plenty of investors will be looking to hold on to their funds to see just how high it can go.

And while the idea of being able to pay for everyday goods using cryptocurrency is appealing, even with the added convenience of Apple Pay it’s still not as simple as using USD. The dollar, after all, is nowhere near as volatile as Bitcoin, where timing is everything: the value you’re cashing out can change so dramatically in a matter of minutes, that it could be the difference between paying over the odds, or potentially getting your item for next to nothing.

Still, it’s more good news for cryptocurrency, which is enjoying a new surge in interest thanks to Tesla’s big investment and CEO Elon Musk’s talking up of Dogecoin. Amazon could soon be getting in on the act, too, with the company seeking talent to launch a digital currency project.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A clear cryptocurrency regulatory regime is urgently needed as major companies like Tesla Inc, BNY Mellon Corp and Mastercard Inc embrace the alternative asset class, a top Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official said.

FILE PHOTO: Commissioner Hester Peirce participates in a U.S Securities and Exchange Commission open meeting to propose changing its decades-old definition of an ""accredited investor"" in order to allow more Americans to buy shares in private companies, in Washington, U.S., December 18, 2019.

Hester Peirce, a Republican commissioner at the agency, also told Reuters in an interview that it was too soon to draw policy conclusions from a “Reddit Rally” in GameStop Corp and other stocks, but it was “wonderful” that a new generation of investors was able to participate in the market.

Dubbed by crypto enthusiasts as the “Crypto Mom” due to her supportive stance on the asset class, Peirce has long advocated for regulators to create clear rules that would allow crypto assets to thrive without fear of breaking the law.

“It’s not only that there have been calls for clarity for some time and that a new administration brings the chance to take a fresh look, but it also is a moment where it seems others in the marketplace are also taking a fresh look,” she said.

Bitcoin hit record highs this month after electric car-maker Tesla said it had invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency and BNY Mellon said it would help clients hold, transfer, and issue digital assets. Mastercard also said it would open up its network to some cryptocurrencies.

“That adds to the urgency of us taking some sort of action in this area to provide more clarity,” said Peirce.

The market was plunged into crisis last month when Reddit users trading on low-cost retail platforms banded together to drive up the prices of GameStop and other stocks, squeezing hedge funds that had bet against those shares.

The resulting volatility triggered massive margin calls from “clearing” houses that guarantee trades, prompting several retail platforms to suspend buying in the affected securities.

The incident sparked outrage among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Vlad Tenev, CEO of trading app Robinhood, Ken Griffin, CEO of hedge fund Citadel LLC and others involved in the saga will testify before Congress on Thursday.

The SEC is examining the “gamut” of issues including market volatility, the role of retail brokers, and how the post-trade market functioned, said Peirce.

“To see new investors participating in the markets is a good thing and of course we want them to be educated and skeptical,” she said, adding that a wide range of market participants could actually help improve price formation.","Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is revealing that he’s teaming up with rapper Jay-Z to start an initiative that aims to fund Bitcoin developers in two of the world’s most populated regions.

In a new tweet, the Twitter co-founder announces that he and Jay-Z are donating 500 Bitcoin to an endowment that will operate as a trust to finance Bitcoin development in Africa and India.

“JAY-Z and I are giving 500 BTC to a new endowment named ₿trust to fund Bitcoin development, initially focused on teams in Africa & India. It‘ll be set up as a blind irrevocable trust, taking zero direction from us.”

At time of writing, the Bitcoin donation is worth approximately $23.9 million.

The duo is currently searching for three individuals to serve as the trust’s board members. Those interested in the role must fill out an application form which states that the trust’s mission is to “make Bitcoin the internet’s currency.”

Last September, the Twitter CEO suggested that Bitcoin is the internet’s most viable native currency.

“I think the internet wants a currency. And wants a native currency. And I think Bitcoin is probably the best realization of that, thus far. I can’t see that changing given all the people who want the same thing and want to build it for that potential.”

According to Twitter CFO Ned Segal, Twitter is also considering allocating some of its cash reserves to Bitcoin.

Dorsey’s announcement arrives amid several challenges facing cryptocurrencies in India and parts of Africa. Plans are afoot in India to potentially ban cryptocurrencies and Africa’s most populous country, Nigeria, earlier this month reminded regulated financial institutions that “dealing in cryptocurrencies or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges is prohibited.”

Other African countries such as Burundi and Zimbabwe have taken even harsher steps toward regulating cryptocurrencies. Burundi banned cryptocurrency trading in September of 2019 while Zimbabwe prohibited regulated financial institutions from processing payments linked to crypto assets in May of 2018.

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Gonin/MicroOne","Canada is bringing a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to North America.

In a statement released on Thursday, the Ontario Securities Commission says it has granted approval for the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF proposed by Canadian asset management firm Purpose Investments.

The ETF is allowed to trade in the following Canadian provinces and territories: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.

A Purpose Investments’ press release reveals that the US-based digital currency exchange and custodian Gemini will serve as the sub-custodian. Toronto-based investment servicing firm CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Company will act as the fund administrator.

According to Purpose Investments’ CEO Som Seif, the ETF is the first of its kind, allowing clients to gain exposure to the leading crypto asset without the need to self-custody.

“The ETF will be the first in the world to invest directly in physically settled Bitcoin, not derivatives, allowing investors easy and efficient access to the emerging asset class of cryptocurrency without the associated risk of self-custody within a digital wallet. Similar to physically-backed gold or silver products, the ETF will always be backed directly by physically settled Bitcoin holdings.”

The Canadian asset management firm highlights that there it will not charge fees for holding the Bitcoin instrument known as trailing commissions. An annual management fee of 1% will be levied while operating expenses and trading costs are yet to be decided.

CoinDesk is an independent operating subsidiary of Digital Currency Group , which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups","(Reuters) - Bitcoin hit a new record high and approached $50,000 on Sunday, building on its record rally as Wall Street and Main Street increasingly adopt the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.

FILE PHOTO: A collection of bitcoin (virtual currency) tokens are displayed in this picture illustration taken Dec. 8, 2017. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/Illustration/File Photo

Bitcoin recently stood at $48,700 on Sunday morning, up more than 3%. It had traded as high as $49,714 earlier in the day. The cryptocurrency is up almost 70% year to date.

After long being shunned by traditional financial firms, bitcoin and other virtual currencies appear to be increasingly entering the mainstream as an asset and routine payment vehicle.

BNY Mellon said last week it formed a new unit to help clients hold, transfer and issue digital assets, just days after Elon Musk’s Tesla revealed it had bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for its cars.

On Friday, Canada’s Ontario Securities Commission approved the launch of Purpose Bitcoin ETF, Toronto-based asset management company Purpose Investments Inc said in a statement. The OSC confirmed it had cleared the launch of the world’s first bitcoin exchange-traded fund, in a separate statement to Reuters.

“The institutional side and corporate America is showing that this movement is not going away anytime soon,” said Edward Moya, senior market strategist at OANDA. “There’s still a raft of big money that’s going to jump onto this bandwagon.”

Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami also said on Friday the Florida city is seeking to embrace bitcoin in its operations, a move that could bring dividends in terms of attracting technology companies.

In January, BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, added bitcoin as an eligible investment to two funds.

Credit card giant Mastercard’s plans to offer support for some cryptocurrencies also boosted bitcoin’s ambitions towards mainstream finance, though many banks remain reluctant to engage with it.

Cryptocurrency miner Riot Blockchain rose 14% on Friday and hit its highest in over 10 years with a weekly gain of 110%, its biggest weekly gain since 2017. Digital asset tech company Marathon Patent Group showed a weekly gain of over 70%.","Why did this happen?

Bitcoin Supply Crisis Deepens as BTC Reaches $40,000

Monday also saw a supply crisis for Bitcoin.

As Finance Magnates reported, Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is undergoing a massive supply crisis as BTC whales transferred their funds from cryptocurrency exchanges to unknown wallets. BTC reserves at digital exchanges reached the lowest level in almost 2.5 years.

According to the latest data published by crypto research and analytics firm Bloqport, 211 new Bitcoin whale addresses with at least 1,000 BTC were created since the start of 2021, but the supply of the world’s largest digital asset decreased significantly during the same time.

It has a market cap of over $8 billion at time of writing (less than 1/100th of bitcoin’s), no unique use case and no lively derivatives market.

But bear with me while I explain why it embodies two key themes impacting institutional interest in crypto assets: the role of “fundamentals,” and the likelihood of successful government bans.

The power of enthusiasm

At time of writing, dogecoin is up almost 1,350% so far this year. Last week, rapper Snoop Dogg temporarily rechristened himself Snoop Doge. Kiss frontman Gene Simmons topped that with a “God of Dogecoin” tweet. Kevin Jonas of the Jonas Brothers joined in. Elon Musk has inspired so many DOGE memes that it would be impossible to list them all here. This is getting fun in a wacky “whatever” kind of way.

But should “fun” drive value?

Why not? As we saw with the GameStop drama, the market’s understanding of “value” is shifting. The relentless rise of the stock market despite record uncertainty and risk, and the relatively new phenomenon of day-trader media stars, show that performance is increasingly a matter of message in a world where messages are coming at us thick, fast and everywhere.

Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine summed it up perfectly:

“Money and value are coordination games; what we use for money depends on the channels that we use to coordinate social activity. Once society was mediated by governments, and we used fiat currency. Now society is mediated by Twitter and Reddit and Elon Musk, so, sure, dogecoin.”

The dogecoin phenomenon may be a flash in the pan, and our attention may shift to something else tomorrow.

Or maybe not. The cryptocurrency’s co-founder Billy Markus told Bloomberg this week that he was “baffled” by the coin’s continued success, more than seven years after launch. The other co-founder Jackson Palmer said last year that it “makes no sense for people to have this devotion to it.” But here’s the thing: neither co-founder can do anything about it. Dogecoin runs on a public, decentralized blockchain that no one controls. It may dwindle into insignificance as people move on to the next shiny thing. But as long as there are fans who enjoy the silliness, it will have value.

Stop the tide

Which brings us to India and Nigeria (still with me?), which this week seemed to forget how public blockchains work.

In January, we reported the Indian Parliament was considering a government-sponsored bill that would ban cryptocurrencies. Needless to say, the community jumped into action with the #IndiaWantsBitcoin campaign, rallying citizens to email their government representatives to ask for progressive legislation.

Among the many arguments against the ban is the damage it would do to a lively ecosystem that includes 10 million-20 million cryptocurrency users, 340 startups and 50,000 employees. The full contents of the bill are not yet public, but it seems to be intent on clearing the field for a government-backed digital rupee.

Hopefully the Indian government will learn from Nigeria.

Last week, Nigeria’s central bank (CBN) ordered banks to close the accounts of cryptocurrency users. In response to the ensuing outcry, the CBN issued a press statement reminding the public that the rule was not new, and that it was for their own good.

The notable thing here is that the CBN felt the need to respond to social protest. This is possibly because of the still-fresh memory of the #EndSARS movement which rocked the country late last year, in which mass protests combined with global online support achieved the dissolution of a federal police unit with a reputation for fierce brutality.

This week, a court ordered the CBN to unblock the accounts of 20 people who had been involved in the movement. The fact that the accounts were frozen in the first place is one of the many reasons seizure-resistant cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining in popularity amongst Nigeria’s young.

The CBN’s actions are being presented on social media as a generational call to arms where the young, tech-savvy army has new tools in its arsenal and a deepening disrespect for institutions. Sound familiar?

They’re also not giving up on crypto. Exchanges such as Binance have been affected because local payment partners are no longer willing to deal with them due to the directive. But sources confirm that trading is moving to peer-to-peer channels.

What’s more, the #EndSARS movement has not gone away even after its victory. It is now attacking what it sees as repression more broadly, and could end up uniting with the #WeWantOurCryptoBack movement to push for – and probably achieve – radical change in Africa’s largest democracy.

The politicians have noticed. The Nigerian senate has invited the governor of the central bank and the director general of the securities regulator to testify on the matter, with one senator coming out as “strongly against” the ban.

Other countries thinking of banning bitcoin will no doubt be watching how this plays out. They will also be taking note that rules can make it harder to transact in cryptocurrencies, and could certainly dampen investor enthusiasm, but – just as the Dogecoin community could not care less about what the network’s founders think – they can’t make it go away.

And the very act of attempting to repress cryptocurrency’s use could light a fire under a generational understanding of why it’s necessary.

The rear guard

What does this have to do with institutional investment in cryptocurrencies?

One of the main risks to bitcoin is overly repressive regulation. Some believe that, as the network becomes more powerful, governments will see it as a threat and decide to intervene. It has been a suggested that national security issues might come into play as Iran, North Korea and Russia ramp up their bitcoin mining.

So, investors – and probably some western regulators – should be paying attention to the developments in India and Nigeria, to see whether an attempt to ban cryptocurrencies could be successful.

Only, now it’s about much more than pushing consumers to public protest and unregulated peer-to-peer platforms. Now the institutions are involved.

Even just looking at the U.S., this week BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, announced that it was planning to roll out a digital custody unit later this year. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citi are rumored to also be looking at crypto custody. Payments giants are stepping up: this week Mastercard revealed it is planning to give merchants the option to receive payments in cryptocurrency later this year. Last week we saw Visa unveil cryptocurrency plans. Cryptocurrency buying and selling appears to be growing into an increasingly significant part of PayPal’s activity. This list is just scratching the surface of public announcements; there is plenty of institutional work going on behind closed doors, as well.

Furthermore, cryptocurrencies now play a significant role in regulated markets in North America and elsewhere. From listed assets to indices to data businesses, traditional markets and crypto markets are becoming inextricably intertwined.

And there is considerable retail support. A study released last summer showed that around 15% of Americans own cryptocurrency, most of whom invested for the first time in the first half of 2020. If that rate of growth is even only partially accurate, the percentage is significantly higher today.

Would any government focused on repairing public trust have the stomach to take on a retail army as well as invested institutions?

As dogecoin has demonstrated, cryptocurrency holders can be vocal and passionate. It’s not just about love for memes, nor is it just about profit. It’s about innovation, choice, freedom of expression and changing what seems to be broken. With social tension on a slow boil that sometimes spills over, the retail market’s enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies and what they represent – supported by growing institutional investment and market infrastructure relevance – should be enough to make any government interested in maintaining its influence wary of measures that could ignite a problem that just might be harder to control.

And as we watch crypto communities flex their collective muscle, as we accept that markets have changed, as we root for the young workers of tomorrow in developing regions, as we applaud the U.S. President’s nominations of individuals knowledgeable about crypto assets to positions of regulatory influence – we are also watching the risk of overly repressive regulation in large, developed economies recede into the distance.

Tesla’s big bet

The week started with a bang, in the form of the announcement that Tesla has invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin. The fact that Tesla has invested isn’t what’s startling – it would have been surprising if it did not get involved. It’s the size of the investment. This is very much a “go big or go home” statement, enough to make anyone sit up and take notice.

The size is also significant in that it reminds us the market is now capable of absorbing such large orders. We don’t know how it was executed, whether via an OTC desk, using a prime broker or directly on exchanges. We also don’t know when. But in late December, Musk was seen on Twitter asking Michael Saylor – yes, he of the very large corporate treasury purchases – if buys of $100 billion were even possible. And the SEC filing says that Tesla updated its policy in January 2021, and made the investment after that.

So, we can conclude that the buys most likely occurred over a few days in January.

You may recall that the beginning of January we saw a strong run-up in the BTC price, from $28,000 at Dec. 31 close to $40,000 on Jan. 9, an increase of over 40%.

The price increase coincided, not surprisingly, with a jump in trading volumes on leading fiat exchanges.

Was Tesla buying then? Is that what pushed the price up? As yet, we have no way of knowing. But we have seen that a market that now regularly trades billions of dollars a day has the capacity and the infrastructure to absorb seriously large orders.

CHAIN LINKS

Investors talking:

“We see fundamental reasons to believe that — regardless of where the price of bitcoin goes next — cryptocurrencies are here to stay as a serious asset class. One is growing distrust in fiat currencies, thanks to massive money printing by central banks. Another is generational: younger people hear the “crypto” in cryptocurrency as new and improved, an exciting digital advance over metal coins.” – Morgan Stanley Investment Management

“Every treasurer should be going to boards of directors and saying, ‘Should we put a small portion of our cash in bitcoin?’” – Jim Cramer

Takeaways:

BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, revealed plans to launch a new digital custody unit later this year. TAKEAWAY: This is a very big deal. A couple of years ago, when we first started hearing about the “wall of institutional money” that was poised to flood the crypto markets, some of us natural skeptics thought “hmm, not until Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon offer crypto services.” We assumed that big traditional funds would rather wait for familiar names that they already work with, than trust startups in a new industry. If the reports about Goldman Sachs are correct, this year will see both of those boxes checked off, as well as many other blue-chip names that are either already involved or are poised to reveal projects they have been working on behind closed doors.

Deutsche Bank is also planning to launch crypto services such as custody, trading, lending, staking, valuation services and fund administration, according to a WEF report. TAKEAWAY: Deutsche Bank is the largest bank in Germany (Europe’s largest economy) and the sixth largest in the EU, ranked by total assets. Its entry into crypto services is likely to make a difference to asset managers considering alternative investments, in that they will be able to do so with a familiar name and with Deutsche Bank’s “blue-chip” reputation validating crypto as an investable asset class. Corporate interest in putting bitcoin on the balance sheet continues to spread. Twitter’s CFO Ned Segal said in an interview on CNBC that the company is considering adding bitcoin to its company reserves, and is looking into bitcoin payment options. TAKEAWAY: This is an interesting twist to the corporate treasury debate, which Tesla brought to light when it revealed its buy and tentative plans to accept bitcoin for customer purchases. It makes more sense to hold some reserves in a currency your company will use in some way.

On Monday, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures volumes on the CME are still tiny ($40 million on Thursday compared with $6 billion on Binance, according to skew.com), but it’s early days yet.

The Purpose Bitcoin ETF received approval from the Ontario Securities Commission to list on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). TAKEAWAY: This will be the first bitcoin ETF in North America. No doubt its inflows will be monitored by the big securities regulator to the south. They could even accelerate approval of a bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as it is relatively easy for U.S. investors to trade on the TSX.

San Francisco-based crypto trading platform Apifiny is planning to go public by the end of the year. TAKEAWAY: So far, all of the planned and rumored public listings for this year that I know of are for companies building and running crypto market infrastructure. This gives investors of all types another way to invest in crypto markets, beyond a direct position in the assets – if asset prices do well, there will be more investor interest and more revenue for market infrastructure firms, which will help their share prices.

JPMorgan has added Signature Bank, one of the few financial institutions in the U.S. to service crypto companies, to its “focus list” of recommended stocks, saying the bank is “positioned to ride the crypto wave.” TAKEAWAY: Just because planned listings seem to be in market infrastructure, there are other ways to bet on crypto market expansion – through the companies that support the companies that support the markets. Oh, and JPMorgan seems to think there’s a “crypto wave” coming.

Crypto lender BlockFi launched its bitcoin trust for accredited investors, with 1.75% management fee (0.25% lower than market leader GBTC). The trust will not list on the OTC markets for another 6-12 months. TAKEAWAY: The competition to market leader Grayscale’s funds (Grayscale is owned by DCG, also parent of CoinDesk) continues to grow, as BlockFi’s trust now joins those run by Bitwise and Osprey. The emerging competition could be one of the reasons the premium retail investors have traditionally been willing to pay on popular trusts such as GBTC has been falling.

Canadian bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms (BITF) has entered into a CAD$40 million ($31 million) agreement to sell 11.5 million common shares, plus an option to buy another tranche for the same number of common shares, to institutional investors. TAKEAWAY: This is the firm’s third financing sale in a month, and reflects the growing investor interest in listed crypto mining companies as a proxy play on the bitcoin price. Over the past three months, BITF’s share price has increased by almost 700% – it’s not surprising they’re taking advantage of the opportunity to shore up the balance sheet while they can.

Source: Google","Macroeconomics guru and Real Vision co-founder Raoul Pal is predicting that Ethereum will surge to $20,000 this cycle.

In a Marco Insiders article, the former Goldman Sachs executive says that his models, including Metcalfe’s Law which states that the value of a network is directly correlated with its number of users, suggest that a crypto asset’s value is based on adoption.

Looking at Ethereum, Pal highlights that the leading smart contract platform’s market cap is highly correlated with its number of active addresses just like Bitcoin.

Pal says the correlation between adoption and network value is not a coincidence.

He explains that Ethereum’s price distribution versus its number of active addresses mirrors Bitcoin’s exact performance at the same stage. He notes that Ethereum is six years younger than Bitcoin and that market participants will have to wait for the same network effects to kick in.

Pal also looks at a key milestone when BTC and ETH achieved 1 million active addresses. According to the Real Vision CEO, ETH’s growth is virtually identical to Bitcoin, just 4 years apart.","TOKYO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings Inc is in talks with foreign financial firms to set up a cryptocurrency joint venture, its chief executive said, as the company aims to expand the business as a core pillar of profitability.

The comments by Yoshitaka Kitao, who founded the company in 1999, comes as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have emerged as alternative investment targets, and global investors have warmed to the rapidly expanding market.

Speaking to Reuters on Friday, Kitao, 70, said that while investors once lived in the world where they invested in stocks or bonds, it’s not an “either-or situation” any more.

“Institutional investors, mainly hedge funds, have recently started investing in cryptocurrencies...Not just institutional investors but also Elon Musk has,” Kitao said.

Musk’s electric vehicle company Tesla Inc revealed earlier this month it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin.

Kitao said at least two deals were under discussion on establishing a joint venture business in cryptocurrency, but declined to elaborate on possible partners.

SBI, Japan’s biggest online brokerage, has been providing cryptocurrency trading services since 2018.

Aiming to expand its cryptocurrency portfolio, SBI last year bought local exchange Tao Tao and acquired a 90% stake in London-based cryptocurrency market maker B2C2. Pretax profit of its cryptocurrency business came in at 6.7 billion yen ($63.9 million) for the nine months through December, a 83% surge from the same period a year earlier.

“Definitely,” Kitao said, when asked whether the business would become one of SBI’s key earners. He also suggested he was considering large-scale mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

“To become number one in the world, our choice is buying a leading company or creating an alliance with major global companies,” he said. “Our M&A strategy will not be something like taking minority stakes in many companies.” ($1 = 104.9300 yen) (Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",,
2021-02-15,"The second week of February was a very profitable one for the crypto industry. Prices began to surge rapidly around 8th February, alongside trading volume. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been marked by particularly strong surges, with them both hitting new all-time highs during last week

Bitcoin price goes above $49,000

Earlier this year, on 8th January, Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high after reaching $42,000. After that, the coin’s value dropped strongly, and then fluctuated between $31k and $35k for around a month. This finally changed on 8th February when a new surge allowed the coin to skyrocket again and make a new all-time high at $48,200.

The surge started seemingly without warning, and it took the coin from the daily low at $48,134 to $48,200 exactly, according to data from CEX.IO. While the surge was followed by a correction, it was rather mild, only causing the coin’s price to drop to $43,800 on 10th February.

After that, BTC surged again, this time once again hitting a new all-time high at $49,019. This price was reached yesterday, 12th February. Since then, the coin once again saw a drop, trading at $47,406 at the time of writing.

While the surge did come suddenly, it was not without reason. In fact, the price of the coin skyrocketed around the time it was revealed that Elon Musk’s Tesla had bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, and that it might accept Bitcoin payments in the future.

Elon Musk’s popularity in the crypto industry has been growing gradually for years, while the world’s richest man casually dropped crypto references on his Twitter every now and then. Over the past few weeks, however, Musk is mentioning Bitcoin and Dogecoin on a daily basis, and he even proclaimed himself an official Bitcoin supporter.

Ethereum hits ATH at $1,870

While all eyes are usually on Bitcoin when major rallies come around, Ethereum’s own success over the past week cannot be overlooked. The coin saw a major surge around the same time as BTC on 8th February, however, unlike Bitcoin which traded sideways before that, ETH price had been making waves for days.

Ethereum actually did not wait for Bitcoin’s lead to start surging. Its growth from the depths to which a previous correction took it actually started on 7th February. After regaining what it lost, it only continued surging up on 8th February, with the BTC rally helping it rise above all past records.

By early 9th February, Ethereum hit a new all-time high at $1,826, only to beat its own record on February 10th by taking an extra step up to $1,844. The coin then struggled with a correction that attempted to push it down for two days, finally overcoming it yesterday, 12th February.

As BTC reached its own latest record, so did Ethereum go further up to $1,870, breaking the record once again and forcing itself one step closer to $1,900, and then the $2,000 mark.

Where are Bitcoin and Ethereum going next?

We believe Bitcoin could keep going up even further, and that it will complete the quarter by hitting $50,000. The coin is already very close to this price, but it seems to be struggling to break through resistance at this level. The move past $40k resulted in a correction that BTC took a whole month to overcome.

Now, it has managed to climb up to a new record of $48k, with $50k just around the corner. This is a major psychological barrier too, and once it is broken, we expect Bitcoin will be able to surge even further up, likely to $80,000 by 31st June, and maybe even to $90,000 by the end of the year.

As for Ethereum, we expected Q1 to end with a price of $1,300, but Ethereum’s performance has exceeded expectations. Etherum has now skyrocketed nearly to $2,000 and is only a short step away from hitting this milestone. At the rate things have been going for it, ETH might reach $2.2k — a record we expected to see by the end of Q2 — before the first quarter is complete. However, nothing is ever certain, and past predictions may yet turn out to be correct, although, at this point, that would mean a strong correction by the end of Q1.

In the end, nothing is certain in the crypto industry, and for now, at least, the prices are significantly stronger than anyone expected them to be.","Why did this happen?

The cryptocurrency almost managed to breach the $50,000 mark on Sunday. Mainstream companies are also jumping on the crypto bandwagon. Reportedly, Apple Pay users can also spend their bitcoin through the native app.

A report by PhoneArena claims that Bitcoins and few other popular crypto-currencies can be used for payment using the Apple Pay app. An app called BitPay allows users to buy Bitcoins as well as use the app’s prepaid Mastercard in the Apple Pay. The BitPay wallet can be added to both Apple Wallet and Apple Pay.

The BitPay wallet app also works with other cryptocurrencies such as Ether, Bitcoin Cash as well as USD Coin, Gemini Dollar, Paxos Standard and Binance USD which are dollar-pegged stable coins.

According to the application's description on Google Play Store, any user can apply for a BitPay Card to start spending crypto instantly. It claims that approval only takes seconds and the virtual card will be available for immediate use online. The user will also get a physical card will after a couple weeks through which the user will be able to convert their crypto into cash at the ATM or spend it in any retail store. However, this will only be available to users in the United States.

The BitPay app is also expected to roll out support on other prominent payment applications such as Google Pay and Samsung Pay. This will allow a large number of Android users to access the service of the application.

Recently, another major American company Tesla announced that buyers of their electric cars can make the purchase the using bitcoin. The CEO of the company, Elon Musk is also a big proponent of cryptocurrency and also promotes a few through his social media accounts.

Share Via","Owners of Apple devices can now use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to purchase goods and services, courtesy of a new arrangement with blockchain payments firm BitPay.

The company’s mobile payments service, Apple Pay, will now support BitPay debit cards, which convert crypto holdings into local fiat currency (e.g. USD, GBP, AUD) when a payment is made.

As per a BitPay blog post , customers will be able to make in-app, contactless and online purchases using Bitcoin, via Apple smartphones, tablets, computers and smartwatches.

Check out our list of the best crypto wallets out there

Here's our list of the best crypto exchanges right now

We've built a list of the best mining rigs available

The BitPay debit card also allows for payments to be made using a range of altcoins , such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH), as well as USD Coin (USDC), Pax Standard (PAX) and Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoins .

According to BitPay, the facility is also set to land for Android users by the end of the quarter, via updates to Samsung Pay and Google Pay services.

Bitcoin payments on iPhone

One of the greatest criticisms levelled at Bitcoin, as a new payments ecosystem, is that holders have little opportunity to actually spend their crypto, because only a minority of vendors support this type of transaction.

With simple crypto payments now available to the millions of Apple Pay users, however, the pool of viable transactions has been greatly expanded.

And nor is Apple the only large technology incumbent working to bring crypto payments to the masses. In October, payments giant PayPal also unveiled a new digital wallet that allows account holders to buy, sell and transact using a range of cryptocurrencies.

When it comes to Bitcoin specifically, however, the problem of volatility remains. At the time of writing, the currency is expected to crest a valuation of $50,000 per coin, up from just $15,500 in mid-November (a circa 225% increase).

This means that anyone that made a purchase in Bitcoin three months ago can now be said to have overpaid by more than 3x, in light of the currency’s new valuation. At the same time, if the digital currency were to take a dive (as has been known), any purchases made in Bitcoin today would effectively be at a discount.

For this reason, transacting using the world’s first and most famous cryptocurrency carries significant risk, so holders are advised to exercise caution and ensure they are able to absorb any potential losses.","Perhaps you’ve heard of Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, or any of the other numerous cryptocurrencies circulating headlines at the moment. Digital currencies are increasingly garnering mainstream attention and so it’s no surprise that big business is finally sitting up and taking notice.

Following Tesla accepting Bitcoin payments, the Apple Pay mobile payment platform will soon accept cryptocurrency via BitPay Card. A statement from BitPay CEO Stephen Pairnotes noted that support will also be coming to Google Pay and Samsung Pay later this quarter. With the big three mobile payment platforms onboard, the implication is that cryptocurrency is now ready for mainstream payments.

Cryptocurrencies have shot to popularity through a combination of concerns over fiat money devaluation, demand for anomalous internet payments, and a volatile FOMO trading environment. Elon Musk’s memes certainly haven’t dented their popularity either. With the latest news, cryptocurrencies appear to be exiting their speculative phase and garnering greater public legitimacy.

Mainstream money

To recap, Apple Pay customers in the US (with Google and Samsung customers soon to follow) can now convert cryptocurrency into USD (via a BitPay Mastercard) in order to make payments at Mastercard debit card terminals. The BitPay Wallet app supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether, as well as four dollar-pegged stable coins, USDC, GUSD, PAX, and BUSD. This certainly isn’t a comprehensive choice of digital currencies but it provides a decent level of support for some of the most popular options.

With major mobile payment support across a variety of platforms, it's never been easier to actually spend those digitals 1s and 0s on products you want.

BitPay isn’t the first instance of crypto payment conversions. There are plenty of crypto debit cards already and the Coinbase Card announced support through Google Pay in March 2020, which enables Visa debit card transactions funded from a Coinbase wallet balance. Coinbase Card supports a wide range of currencies, specifically BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, XRP, BAT, REP, ZRX, and XLM. It’s also available in the EU, UK, and US. However, BitPay bringing Apple Pay onboard is a major milestone on the road to mainstream use.

Of course, growing support from card and mobile payment platforms isn’t just about transactions in stores. The door is now also open to making payments with virtually all online retailers around the world. Customers can also use the cards to withdraw cash from ATMs, making it easier to access digital funds in physical form when required. With major mobile payment support across a variety of platforms, it’s never been easier to actually spend those digitals 1s and 0s on products you want. That’s certainly good news for cryptocurrencies when it comes to future prospects and legitimacy as an alternative to fiat currencies. However, bringing virtual coins to mobile payment platforms somewhat dilutes the formula that has made Bitcoin and other digital currencies popular so far.

For starters, applying for a BitPay Prepaid Mastercard, or any other card, requires a social security number or other forms of ID, adding in a paper trail that some had been keen to avoid in the early crypto wild west. Apple Pay and Google Pay also track your recent transactions, somewhat undermining the anonymous allure of cryptocurrency transactions versus regular card payments.

It’s very important to note that these Visa and Mastercard-based services don’t provide coin-to-coin transactions. You don’t actually pay in Bitcoin. Rather they are a medium for converting digital coins into a more universal used currency (USD in this case) in order to complete a transaction in fiat current. That added middle layer is a necessary step to enable universal payments to businesses that don’t support cryptocurrencies directly. But as cryptocurrency aficionados know, loading and withdrawing from wallets is where cracks in the more anonymous nature of these currencies begin to appear. Coin-to-coin transactions remain limited to the far less-mainstream crypto exchanges and some online wallet providers.

It may be easier than ever to pay for items using crypto, but digital wallets and markets are still a financial niche.

Speaking of wallets, virtually all of the unpegged cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile too. Their value can fluctuate by multiple percentage points a day, meaning that $1,000 you put into Bitcoin this morning might be worth $600 or $1,400 by the time you come to spend it. That’s not a desirable attribute if you’re saving for a big purchase and cryptocurrency wallets still shouldn’t be considered as an alternative to a traditional bank account for your daily spending needs. Likewise, loading up wallets, paying variable “miners fees” or invoices, and transaction times that can roll from minutes into hours or even days are abstract concepts to most consumers that simply get into the way of day-to-day purchases.

Bitcoin prices are incredibly volatile across all time frames.

It may be easier than ever to pay using crypto, but the nature of juggling wallets and multiple volatile currencies hasn’t changed. Until there’s a tangible benefit to paying for your day-to-day items with a digital currency, they will likely remain a niche for those more interested in investing rather than those looking to pay for their groceries.

The recent announcement of BitPay coming to Apple Pay and equivalent Android services may well be a major step along the road to mainstream cryptocurrencies, but we’re definitely not there yet. Instead, this is simply another sign that big technology and banking players are increasingly paying attention to the value and volume of transactions taking place in Bitcoin and other markets.

As BitPay Card and other similar transactions are ultimately still being handled in traditional fiat currencies, the current setup is more of a workaround than a ground-up digital currency revolution. Particularly in the case of pre-paid cards like BitPay, which load the card with funds via an invoice. Even so, a greater number of transactions and increased liquidity in digital currency markets will likely spur adoption in the coming months and years. As such, opinions about and demand for cryptocurrency look set to remain as hot as ever.","While the naysayers continue to wish for the so-called “Bitcoin bubble” to burst, the premium cryptocurrency continues to scale to new heights, seemingly with each passing day. For example, within the same week of Tesla announcing its foray into the crypto market, Bitcoin (BTC) proceeded to surge by almost $10,000.

And even though the market subsequently faced a correction, things took a turn for the better as soon as news broke that BNY Mellon, the United States’ oldest private bank, entered the crypto fray, sending the largest digital currency by total market capitalization on an upward trajectory once again.

In this regard, the banking giant, with $2.2 trillion in assets under management and $41.1 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration, announced its decision to hold, transfer and issue Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an asset manager on behalf of its clients, potentially exposing this asset class to an entirely new section of investors.

Another reason for the current momentum could be payments giant Mastercard announcing its decision to allow its user base to use crypto assets across its 30 million merchants. Additionally, on Feb 11, PayPal announced its plans to expand its recently introduced cryptocurrency offering into the United Kingdom market. Not only that, the company’s mobile service subsidiary, Venmo, also revealed that it’s looking to roll out digital asset services to its 29 million users sometime over the next few months.

What does BNY Mellon’s entry mean for the market?

As per reports, BNY Mellon is looking to manage cryptocurrencies using a platform that is currently in its prototype phase. In this regard, it has also been reported that the system will in addition be capable of handling a wide array of traditional holdings such as Treasurys and stocks.

It also appears as though the financial institution has not outlined which crypto assets it will be providing its custody services for. Furthermore, BNY Mellon has already deployed a team of executives, led by Michael Demissie, to spur the integration of cryptocurrency custody and management into the bank’s existing product suite.

Speaking with Cointelegraph, Hank Holland, founder and managing partner of private equity firm Pegasus Growth Capital and former managing director of Merrill Lynch, opined that as an established, trusted private bank and one of the largest custodians servicing registered investment advisers, BNY’s commitment to custody digital assets is a necessary, predicated step for broader investor acceptance and adoption of BTC and other crypto assets:

“The strategic initiative addresses two important obstacles. First, for the average investor who doesn’t want to manage a private key, BNY’s custody solution provides a familiar ‘on-ramp’ to own BTC. Second, for a financial advisor to recommend an allocation to BTC and digital assets, the investment needs to be on their platform. Thus, enabling them to charge an advisory fee.”

The first exposure for most of BNY’s clients, according to Holland, will be to buy BTC in order to incorporate the asset into their overall strategic allocation outlook. However, initial client purchases may be followed by other investments into an actively managed portfolio of diverse digital assets, as well as borrowing/staking strategies to supplement their regular income streams.

Similarly, Marcos Benítez Rubianes, client relationship manager for Gazprombank, told Cointelegraph that the news confirms the traditional financial system’s overall growing acceptance of Bitcoin — the oldest, most liquid crypto asset — adding:

“We have witnessed a cascade effect since Paypal announced the integration of crypto trading into their platform. Now in 2021; on one side, you have one of the most valuable companies globally, Tesla, acquiring BTC for their balance sheet and, on the other hand, the oldest bank in America, providing Bitcoin services to their clients.”

Additionally, Rubianes is confident that in the near future, more traditional players will embrace Bitcoin as an asset, maybe even as a payment means, especially because their clients will feel the need to stay abreast with the times and will pressure these institutions to provide them with increased crypto exposure.

Is a Bitcoin surge a foregone conclusion?

With Bitcoin now beginning to target the $50,000 threshold, it’s worth delving into the question of whether a rally may be looming on the horizon. On the subject, Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo — a crypto exchange and lending service — told Cointelegraph that it’s one thing when a tech firm like Tesla embraces BTC, but it’s a whole new ball game when the oldest lender in the U.S. does it, adding: “Generational clashes are always fascinating to watch. Banks that follow suit, and many inevitably will, will simply be second.”

Rubianes believes that another surge may be in the cards if more financial incumbents take the step toward integrating crypto. If that happens, he believes that interest in the space could potentially increase tenfold. “Those in the crypto space understand quite clearly that one of the most significant barriers to crypto adoption has been, perhaps ironically, the self-custody part,” he added.

However, not everybody shares this narrative. Alexander Suhobokov, head of fintech at Switzerland-based Dukascopy Bank, told Cointelegraph that even though a gradual integration of the crypto and traditional financial industries is actively ongoing, and banks that don’t get with the times in the next one to two years will face a real risk of losing their competitive edge, it's highly unlikely that this news will have any major impact on BTC:

“There is a much greater chance that BTC’s value will be under harsh pressure as an externality of the regulators’ decisions on USDT. Let’s hope that these possible disturbances wouldn’t derail crypto’s potential.”

So, what should be expected from Bitcoin?

Following BNY’s, Mastercard’s and PayPal’s commitment to exploring the crypto landscape more closely in the near future, Twitter — home to Jack Dorsey, the man behind financial services firm Square — recently confirmed that it is looking to offer its employees the possibility of receiving their salaries in Bitcoin.

Not only that, the social media giant’s chief financial officer, Ned Segal, stated that the company is exploring the option of adding BTC to its existing balance sheets. However, he believes that much of this will depend on whether or not enough people are interested in conducting BTC transactions with the tech firm.

Lastly, Daniel Pinto, co-president of major U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase, stated in a recent interview that the company too will eventually have to get involved in Bitcoin.“The demand isn’t there yet, but I’m sure it will be at some point,” he added.

Overall, looking at the sentiment surrounding the space, it seems that there is confidence growing surrounding BTCs chances of reaching the all-important $50,000 psychological barrier, especially as the premier cryptocurrency continues to successfully stave off the bearish momentum that sent the digital asset’s value to as low as $46,110 over the course of the last 24 hours. As a result, BTC is once again sitting comfortably at around the $48,000 mark.","As if the all the rage surrounding Bitcoin needed another catalyst, news of Elon Musk buying $1.5 billion of the leading cryptocurrency swept over the digital currency world, and it saw its price vault above $48,000 for the first time. Musk is following in the footsteps of Square Inc. (SQ) and MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in buying Bitcoin for their corporate treasuries.

Mr. Musk is also considering allowing buyers of Tesla autos to pay in Bitcoin. Not to be outdone, MasterCard (MA) announced late last week that it is evaluating having its vendors allow for purchases in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. PayPal Inc. (PYPL) started allowing its 35 million vendors around the world to accept payment in Bitcoin, and the stock has soared since.

Against these developments, Wall Street is under increasing pressure to allow for the trading of cryptocurrencies on mainstream trading platforms. Investors want to trade cryptocurrencies at Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, etc., which is putting the heat on these firms to accommodate their clients.

At present, the only instrument traded at the biggest brokerages is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), shares of which are highly correlated to underlying price movement of Bitcoin. And like every other asset that trades on the NYSE and Nasdaq, GBTC is open for trading at 9:30 am EST and closed for trading at 4:00 pm EST.

Because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies trade 24/7, the big brokerages have to determine if they want to staff up a crypto desk that never closes, even on weekends. It’s a tall order, but will likely come to pass, just as commission-free trading swept over the industry when Schwab first introduced it.

Trading cryptos is about to become very widespread among retail customers at the big brokers, and the very last thing they want to see is money leaving for Coinbase.com.

Source: www.coinbase.com

Stay tuned for what should be a digital gold rush by Wall Street to be the first to market with a trading platform for cryptocurrency investing and trading. As a result, these digital coins are very likely to increase in value, just on the exposure alone. My take on this situation is to consider accumulating some of these digital currencies before they hit Wall Street trading floors and wait for the tsunami of new crypto investors to buy in.","Canadian financial regulator clears way for world’s first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, improving investor access to the volatile virtual asset

Canada’s principal financial regulator has approved the launch of the world’s first exchange-traded fund linked to Bitcoin, bringing the cryptocurrency a step closer to the mainstream.

The Ontario Securities Commission confirmed it has cleared the launch of the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which will seek to replicate the performance of the price of Bitcoin, less the ETF’s fees and expenses, according to a fact sheet provided by Toronto-based Purpose Investments.

Exchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds, but are traded on stock exchanges throughout the day, while mutual funds are traded based on their value at the close of trading.

Such funds generally aim to trade as close as possible to an asset’s net value, unlike other types of funds which may trade at a premium.

Investor access

“The ETF will be the first in the world to invest directly in physically settled Bitcoin, not derivatives, allowing investors easy and efficient access to the emerging asset class of cryptocurrency,” Purpose Investments said in a statement.

The fund is to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker BTCC.

Cidel Trust Company is to be the custodian of the ETF while Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss’ Gemini Trust Company is the sub-custodian and Ernst and Young is the auditor.

Bitcoin is currently trading at over $47,000 (£33,900), up from $10,000 a year ago and less than $1,000 in January 2017, a dramatic rise that has spurred intense investor interest.

The cryptocurrency has gained about 63 percent so far this year and about 1,130 percent since mid-March 2020.

Last week electric carmaker Tesla disclosed it had acquired $1.5bn in Bitcoin and said would accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment for its automobiles, an announcement that caused a further price rise in the virtual asset.

Mainstream interest

Cryptocurrency has also been gaining acceptance amongst mainstream financial companies, while central banks have explored creating versions of the technology that might be less subject to volatility.

In another sign of mainstream interest, the city of Miami last week voted to explore handling some city government transactions in Bitcoin.

Several firms in the US have tried to create Bitcoin ETFs, but have been turned down by the Security and Exchange Commission, which has typically cited concerns such as the potential for market manipulation.

Some industry watchers have speculated the SEC might soon follow Canada’s lead, with others pointing out that the regulator’s new leadership is likely to take its time in reviewing investment firms’ ETF applications.

The incoming US administration named former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Gary Gensler as head of the SEC in January.

Bitcoin remains subject to large price swings, with a dramatic 2017 rise followed by a crash of 80 percent that affected cryptocurrencies across the board from January to September 2018."

The world’s largest digital currency by market valuable rose more than 3 percent to an all-time high of $50,389 just after 7:30 a.m. ET, according to data from Coin Metrics.

Bitcoin has had a boost from news of large firms like Tesla, Mastercard and BNY Mellon warming to cryptocurrencies. Tesla last revealed it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and plans to accept the digital coin as payment for its products, while Mastercard said it would open up its network to some digital currencies. PayPal and BNY Mellon have also made big moves to support crypto.

Tesla’s use of corporate cash to buy bitcoin sparked speculation over whether other major companies would follow suit. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi last week told CNBC that the company had discussed but “quickly dismissed” the idea of buying bitcoin. The firm is however considering whether to accept cryptocurrencies as payment.

These developments have led some crypto investors to believe the latest bull run is different to rallies past. Bitcoin skyrocketed to nearly $20,000 in late 2017 before losing more than 80 percent of its value the following year. Bitcoin believers say that, whereas the 2017 bubble was driven by retail speculation, the current cycle is being fueled by demand from institutional investors.

“I think bitcoin is a much more stable asset class today than it was three years ago,” Michael Saylor, CEO of enterprise software firm MicroStrategy, told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” program on Tuesday. “It used to be dominated by leveraged retail traders … on international markets with a lot of leverage.”

MicroStrategy and Jack Dorsey’s fintech firm Square hit the headlines last year after taking the unusual strategy of using corporate cash to purchase bitcoin.

“I think that starting in March of 2020, you saw institutions start to arrive and I think in 2021 you’re gonna see that trend continue,” Saylor added. “There’re enthusiasts for bitcoin as a medium of exchange … but I personally believe that the compelling use case is a store of value.”

MicroStrategy has seen its share price climb more than sevenfold since it first bought bitcoin in August. The company announced Tuesday that it would offer $600 million in convertible bonds to buy more bitcoin. There has been speculation that MicroStrategy offered a blueprint for Tesla’s bitcoin purchase after an exchange between Saylor and Elon Musk on Twitter about making “large transactions” with the cryptocurrency.

Still, skeptics see bitcoin as a speculative asset and worry it may be one of the biggest market bubbles in history. Some economists and investors say bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value, while others view bitcoin as the most extreme bubble in financial markets.","Price Point

Bitcoin (BTC) shot past $50,000 for the first time Tuesday to a new all-time high price.

The gain took the year-to-date return to about 70%, and traders immediately began to discuss what comes next.

""We’re still in the midst of a violent bull run that will soon be more violent,” Ari Paul, chief investment officer of BlockTower Capital, tweeted Sunday.

""We're concerned about the pace of these market moves and would therefore recommend proceeding with caution over the short term,"" Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital, said in an email.

VERGE SNAFU: Verge, a small cryptocurrency serving as a payments option on Pornhub, suffered a massive 560,000-block reorganization Monday, according to researchers at Coin Metrics.

The past 200 days of Verge transaction history ""just vanished,"" wrote Coin Metrics network data analyst Lucas Nuzzi. He described the event as ""likely the deepest reorg that has ever taken place in a 'top 100' cryptocurrency.""

Verge's official Twitter account said the ""dev team has released a fix,"" and everything should be ""business as usual"" in ""13 hours,"" CoinDesk's Zack Voell reported.

The cryptocurrency previously known as DogecoinDark is no stranger to network attacks. It suffered similar but less severe exploits in April 2018 and May 2018.

Nouveau riche emerge as crypto market cap tops $1.5 trillion

This ranking of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value shows how the leaders from prior years, like XRP and litecoin, have been elbowed out recently by fast-growing blockchain projects like Cardano and Polkadot. Source: Messari

The market value of all cryptocurrencies has topped $1.5 trillion for the first time, and it’s interesting to note just how much of that growth has been fueled by speculation over which projects might be the most promising, rather than just the pumping of also-ran tokens that dominated the industry’s top ranks in recent years.

Sure, the industry leaders bitcoin and Etherum’s ether still dominate the charts, representing roughly $1.1 trillion of the total. But the top 10 tokens now include cardano (ADA), polkadot (DOT), Binance coin (BNB) and chainlink (LINK) – all associated with projects perceived as having at least some claim on helping to create the future of finance.

They’re crypto’s nouveau riche, climbing in the industry hierarchy at the expense of XRP (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH), which held sway until recently but apparently have failed to inspire traders to the same degree.

Some companies in the growing arena of decentralized finance (DeFi), a subsector of the crypto industry where entrepreneurs are using blockchain technology to design automated versions of lenders and trading platforms, are raising money through token sales the way a Silicon Valley startup might sell an equity interest to a venture-capital fund.

In fact, Synthetix, a decentralized trading project, has just raised $12 million from investors Coinbase Ventures, Paradigm and IOSG – apparently through a sale of the project’s associated SNX tokens. “The raise looks to be a rare occurrence of VCs investing through the purchase of a platform’s native token directly from its treasury rather than wiring funds to its founders,” CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn wrote Sunday. The SNX tokens have tripled in price this year to a market value of about $2.9 billion.

“Individually, none of these may make sense, and no one can really predict who actually will win,” John Wu, president of Ava Labs, said in an interview. His company backs the Avalanche blockchain, whose native AVAX cryptocurrency is up roughly 10-fold this year to a market value of $3 billion. And that’s after the revelation of a programming bug last week triggered a quick price correction.

“This is very similar to tech investing where people are paying for the future,” Wu said.

Token Watch

Ether (ETH):

Staked ether in ""2.0"" deposit contract tops $5.5 billion.

Price hit new all-time high of $1,872.52 on Feb. 12.

Simon Peters, cryptoasset analyst for the trading platform eToro, wrote in an email: ""Supply is constrained by investors depositing coins off the network, and buying from institutional investors continues to climb.""

Denis Vinokourov, head of research for crypto prime broker Bequant: ""The amount of bitcoin locked on Ethereum remains on a relentless trend higher (174k as of this morning), underpinning the 'hunt for yield' trade, which, combined with the surge higher by BTC resulted in the total value locked on DeFi platforms surging to over $40 billion. However, the well documented double-edged sword of a 'hyperactive' Ethereum network with erratic gas fees continues to wreak havoc and cause hour-long delays in transaction validations, yet again squeezing out the smaller market participants. The time for platforms to put more focus on layer-2 solutions is here, and doing so will prove beneficial for the broader ecosystem because it will likely drive many users towards decentralized exchanges.""

Dogecoin (DOGE):

Price has fallen in five of the past eight days to about 5.8 cents.

Slide accelerated after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday: ""If major dogecoin holders sell most of their coins, it will get my full support. Too much concentration is the only real issue imo.""

One dogecoin address holds 27% of meme token's supply, according to Decrypt.

Avalanche (AVAX):

An unusually high volume of transactions highlighted a code bug that severely crippled the Avalanche blockchain last week, but funds were never at risk, an engineer Ava Labs, the development company behind the network, wrote in a Medium post on Sunday.

The episode represented an embarrassment for the because the ""Ethereum killer"" blockchain has touted its ability to handle high throughput.

AVAX tokens have tumbled in price since the incident, though they're still up 11-fold so far in 2021.

MOHAMED EL-ERIAN SEES GROWING “OFFICIAL” RISK: “The private sector is embracing more and more bitcoins as both a form of payment and as away to invest,” the Allianz chief economist told CNN’s Julia Chatterley in an interview. “The official sector is warning more about bitcoin. The real accident here is that the official sector says, enough is enough.”","SILVER SPRING, Md. — The seemingly unstoppable rise of Bitcoin continued Tuesday with the cost of a single unit of the digital currency rising above $50,000 for the first time.

The price of Bitcoin has risen almost 200% in the last three months and its volatility was on display Tuesday. After rising above $50,600, it fell back to $48,674 at 2:15 p.m. At that price, with about 18.6 million Bitcoins in circulation, Bitcoin has a market value of nearly $907 billion.

Bitcoin is rallying as more companies signal the digital currency could eventually gain widespread acceptance as a means of payment. The vast majority of those who have acquired Bitcoin have treated it as a commodity, like gold, with few places accepting it in exchange for goods or services.

Companies have been leery because of Bitcoin’s volatility and its use by parties who want to avoid the traditional banking system for myriad reasons.

Last week, however, the electric car company Tesla sent a tremor through the digital currency markets, saying that it was buying $1.5 billion in Bitcoin as part of a new investment strategy, and that it would soon be accepting Bitcoin as payment for its cars.

BNY Mellon, the oldest bank in the U.S., followed a day later, saying it would include digital currencies in the services it provides to clients. Mastercard said it would start supporting “select crypto currencies” on its network. And Blue Ridge Bank of Charlottesville, Va., said it would allow cardholders to purchase and redeem Bitcoin at 19 of its ATMs.

Lee Reiners, who teaches fintech and cryptocurrency courses at Duke University School of Law, believes many companies will remain hesitant to accept Bitcoin as payment for products and services because of the volatile price.

“If you were a merchant, why would you accept payment in an asset that could be worth 20% less a day after you receive it?,” Reiners said in an email.

But Richard Lyons, a finance professor at the University of California at Berkeley, predicts Bitcoin and other digital currencies “will become transactional currencies increasingly over the next five years. It’s not going to happen overnight,” he said.","Amy E. Price/Contributor/Getty Images

Tesla has paved the way for more corporations to head down the path to owning and accepting bitcoin, according to Wedbush.

The firm says current bitcoin mania is not a ""fad,"" but the start of a new era of digital currency.

PayPal, Square, Mastercard, and Visa could benefit from the crypto boom, Wedbush said.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Tesla's bitcoin bet could be a ""game changer"" for the digital currency and the broader adoption of blockchain technology over the coming years, according to Wedbush.



Given the still nascent and volatile nature around bitcoin, less than 5% of public companies will likely invest in bitcoin over the next twelve to eighteen months, but that could move ""markedly higher"" as more regulation and acceptance of the cryptocurrency takes hold in the future, a team of analysts said in a Monday note.

Bitcoin reached a new high above $50,000 Tuesday morning, bringing its year-to-date gains to 74% in a sign of the growing acceptance of the digital currency.

According to Wedbush, the bitcoin mania is not simply a ""fad,"" but a sign of the broader digital currency and blockchain space growing.

""...We believe the trend of transactions, bitcoin investments, and blockchain driven initiatives could surge over the coming years as this bitcoin mania is not a fad in our opinion, but rather the start of a new age on the digital currency front,"" said Wedbush.

Also, Tesla's announcement to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment could be a ""paradigm changing move for the use of bitcoin from a transaction perspective.""

This will bode well for payments companies PayPal and Square, said Wedbush. Both of those companies allow consumers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies which is resulting in higher frequency usage of their consumer-facing ecosystems.

The crypto-boom could also be a ""neutral to slight positive"" for Visa and Mastercard, said Wedbush. Those two networks are gradually planning to accept central bank digital currencies and asset-backed currencies in payments transactions. Mastercard will start supporting certain cryptocurrencies directly on the network in 2021, which could open merchants up to new customers, the analysts added.

Also, Visa plans to launch a pilot crypto software program to help banks roll out bitcoin and cryptocurrency buying and trading services.

Read more: UBS says bitcoin is a bubble and too volatile to diversify a portfolio, unlike gold - here's why the bank says it could end up 'worthless'","The stock market's rally briefly petered out at midday on Tuesday, as investors seemed to think twice before pushing major market benchmarks too much further into record territory. The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) was down very slightly as of noon EST after being up as much as half a percent earlier in the trading session.

One emerging trend on the Nasdaq and other stock exchanges has been a rise in interest in cryptocurrency stocks. With the price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) briefly topping $50,000, many Nasdaq-listed stocks in the sector posted extremely sharp gains. Here's more about them and what's driving interest in their underlying businesses.

A big rise for Bitcoin-related stocks

Across the Bitcoin space, several stocks of companies involved in cryptocurrency operations did well. Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) picked up 15% at midday, while Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ:MARA) rose 11%, and Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT) added 7%.

What all three of these companies have in common is that they're involved in Bitcoin mining. Each has built up an impressive array of computer equipment that seeks to perform the calculations necessary to unlock the next block of Bitcoin. It costs money to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but when the price of Bitcoin rises, the potential profit from success increases.

Riot, Marathon, and Bit Digital were all close to becoming profitable when they reported their third-quarter financial results. With Bitcoin prices having skyrocketed, it's entirely possible that their fourth-quarter results will be even more favorable. If that happens, it could fuel another wave higher in the speculative moves of these cryptocurrency mining stocks.

Scared of a downturn?

What was particularly interesting, though, was that shares of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) fell 5%. The company has been aggressive in tapping cryptocurrency markets for holding available capital on its balance sheet, and it took another step forward that will further increase its leverage to Bitcoin prices.

MicroStrategy filed documents to sell another $600 million in convertible senior notes. The move follows up on similar debt-raising activity recently, and the company said it will use the proceeds to add to its stake of roughly 71,000 Bitcoin tokens as of its most recent disclosure.

With Bitcoin prices surging, the bet has thus far paid off well for MicroStrategy. The risk, of course, is that if Bitcoin falls back, it could produce significant losses that might affect MicroStrategy's ability to repay its debt.

However, the company has incorporated some alternatives for repaying bondholders under certain conditions, potentially being able to use MicroStrategy stock. Moreover, MicroStrategy might hope that its own stock price will rise high enough to encourage bondholders to convert their debt to stock, avoiding the need to liquidate cryptocurrency in the future to repay them in cash.

Be careful with Bitcoin

The cryptocurrency markets behave differently from stock markets, and even the volatility on the Nasdaq pales in comparison to the soaring and plunging prices of Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. Investors need to exercise caution before diversifying their investment exposure into cryptocurrency.

The price of bitcoin rose by as much as 4.9% on Tuesday, to $50,547.70, an intraday record high.

Interest from institutional investors is adding legitimacy and confidence to the rally.

BNY Mellon is creating a crypto unit, while Morgan Stanley is reportedly weighing investing.

The price of bitcoin on Tuesday jumped above $50,000 for the first time, bringing its year-to-date gain to 74%. Recent interest from Wall Street institutions has added to the momentum.

Bitcoin rose by as much as 4.9%, to $50,547.70. The cryptocurrency then pared gains slightly, trading at $48,853.99 as of 9 a.m. ET.

Elon Musk's Tesla triggered the latest climb when it said on February 8 that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in January and that it intended to start accepting the coin as payment.

Interest from major financial firms including BNY Mellon and Mastercard has helped to support the rally by adding legitimacy to the asset.

""Growing corporate support for the crypto makes this a very different market to what it was in 2017,"" said Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at the trading platform Markets.com, referring to that year's volatility.

A Wall Street Journal report on Thursday said BNY Mellon planned to issue, hold, and transfer clients' bitcoin. It would be the first global bank to provide an integrated digital-asset service to its customers.

Mastercard said on Wednesday that it would begin allowing customers to use ""select cryptocurrencies"" on its network later this year.

Bloomberg reported on Saturday that a $150 billion investment arm of Morgan Stanley was considering betting on bitcoin. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

JPMorgan Copresident Daniel Pinto told CNBC on Friday that he was convinced more banks would get involved thanks to client demand. ""The demand isn't there yet, but I'm sure it will be at some point,"" Pinto said.

The interest from big players has supported the narrative that institutional investors are increasingly interested in bitcoin. This belief has been a key driver of the astounding rally in the price of bitcoin: from below $4,000 last March to $50,000 on Tuesday.

It has also helped other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, the coin on the Ethereum network. Its price was roughly flat on Tuesday, at $1,793, after hitting a record high above $1,870 over the weekend.

""It's been a fantastic couple of weeks for the cryptocurrency space, with numerous big names making bitcoin-related announcements,"" said Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at the currency platform Oanda.

When ETF?

The narrative

The big news last week was the Ontario Securities Commission approved North America’s first bitcoin ETF in Canada. An ETF, which is essentially a retail-friendly, regulated bitcoin investment vehicle that can trade in popular brokerage apps, has long been a product the industry has wanted. Numerous applications have been rejected in the U.S., but the approval of one in Canada could be an early sign that we’ll soon see something similar in the States.

Why it matters

Basically, the idea is a bitcoin ETF would provide everyday investors with:

Bitcoin exposure through existing retail trading apps, such as TD Ameritrade, BUT: These traders would not actually need to buy bitcoin.

In short, an ETFwould let people invest in bitcoin without having to set up a wallet or trust in an exchange that might go down when market volatility rises.

There are also those who believe an ETF would help spark or continue a bull run, but considering Elon Musk can pretty much just do that on his own now I’m not so sure an ETF seems as necessary as it did in 2018.

Breaking it down

The crypto market has matured since 2017 and 2018, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was rejecting ETF applications left and right.

Matthew Hougan, the chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management (a firm that’s gone to great lengths to get a bitcoin ETF approved), told CoinDesk that the futures market tied to cryptocurrencies has grown significantly, the underlying spot markets are functioning better and the U.S. regulatory structure has evolved. But is that enough?

The main question is whether the market has matured enough to meet the requirements listed under the Securities Exchange Act, the federal law that oversees securities trading within the U.S.

Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood recently told an audience she thinks the bitcoin market might need to see $2 trillion in demand before the SEC is comfortable with an ETF.

Hougan isn’t so sure, saying he thinks bitcoin’s futures market is comparable to hard wheat in size (hard wheat has both a futures market and ETFs, which is more than you can say for onions).

Gary Gensler

Some of the thinking about whether or not to file a bitcoin ETF application involves the new administration and the nomination of Gary Gensler as SEC chair. Gensler, a longtime crypto advocate who’s perhaps best known for his work on derivatives regulation at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after the last financial crisis, is expected to be fairly crypto-friendly, at least to the degree of approving an ETF. Still, questions remain.

“It’s certainly too early to say what his view will be on crypto, whether it will be a priority, what that will do to influence the market, and I think that may even be a premature conversation,” Hougan said.

At the least, while Gensler may be interested in crypto, it’s not likely to be a priority, given many of the other issues he’ll have to address, including likely having to form a response to the market volatility seen last month with the GameStop stock pump.

The better question is what has changed over the past two years.

According to Hougan, the factors that would support an ETF approval include:

Market efficiency has increased;

Regulatory oversight has evolved;

New custody solutions have entered the market; and

There are better audit processes.

However, the SEC has used various objections in rejecting past ETF applications. The outstanding questions include:

Whether the SEC’s market surveillance questions have been answered; and

Whether the SEC’s market manipulation questions have been answered.

“The market has gotten better and so the question you’re left with is ‘do we know enough’ and ‘has the market gotten better enough’ and we just don’t know,” Hougan said.

Canada

One positive sign for the industry is last week’s approval of an open-ended ETF in Canada. To be clear, it’s not the first fund to trade in Canada: 3iq launched a bitcoin fund last year. However, this is the first ETF that will trade on a retail-accessible exchange – the Toronto Stock Exchange – within North America.

Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, said on Twitter the “U.S. usually follows shortly after” Canadian regulators in approving such products, calling the approval a “good sign” for American applicants.

His guess: Late September is when we’ll see the approval, and it could see $50 billion in inflows over its first year.

Here’s what needs to happen:

A company has to file for an ETF by filing a Form 19b-4. Two companies have filed for an ETF recently: VanEck and Valkyrie. However, neither has filed a 19b-4 form, which would kick off the SEC review process.

Once someone does file the 19b-4 form, however, the SEC has to acknowledge it’s reviewing it. This kicks off a 45-day review period.

The SEC can say it needs more time and/or provide feedback. The agency can extend the review period up to 240 days (240 days from today would be Oct. 14).

The SEC staff would decide whether or not to approve the application, and then the five commissioners would agree (or disagree, as the case may be).

At some point, the SEC would have to approve or reject the application.

If the application is approved, congratulations to the issuer and to the next big thing that everyone will get excited about.

If the application is denied, a Commissioner (or applicant) could request a review of the decision. This happened to nine ETF applications that were rejected simultaneously in 2018. I still have no idea what the resolution was.

Come to think of it, the SEC also reviewed a Bitwise application that was rejected. The company later withdrew that particular application.

So, in short, while there are positive signs for an ETF approval in 2021, nothing is guaranteed.

SEC lawsuits

In other, unrelated news, last week Acting SEC Chair Allison Herren Lee published a statement ending the contingent settlement offers that could lead to the faster resolution of SEC cases. This means that cases could drag on longer for crypto companies that get caught in the SEC crosshairs. (Here’s looking at you: Ripple.)

The statement said the agency’s Division of Enforcement will no longer recommend settlements that are contingent on whether or not a company receives a waiver to act as a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer (WKSI).

These waivers had perks. In the past, they could be used as part of a settlement offer if the SEC was suing a company on securities law violations.

In other words, if the SEC Division of Enforcement is suing a company, say a hypothetical cryptocurrency-related firm, for alleged violations of the law, a settlement could have been contingent on the firm receiving WKSI status. This condition helped companies know what their penalties would be in a settlement, and what they could do post-litigation.

Lee said this leads to a potential conflict between the SEC’s different divisions.

This new policy would appear to lessen the chances of such settlements occuring in future.

Commissioners Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman pushed back against the move in a dissenting statement, writing that the previous policy didn’t lead to any structural conflicts.

Companies may be less willing to pursue settlements if they don’t know whether they’ll receive waivers to continue operating, they wrote, warning that this could lead to more time (and therefore, resources) spent pursuing cases.

It remains to be seen what incoming chair Gary Gensler will do. By the way – I’ll be talking about this case during a virtual panel hosted by the New York Financial Writers’ Association next Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. ET. Come check it out.

Biden's rule

Honestly, not a whole lot has happened in the past week. No new nominations, no confirmation hearings scheduled yet. However, the U.S. Senate’s impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump has wrapped up, which should give the body more time to consider nominations.

Changing of the guard

Key: (nom.) = nominee, (rum.) = rumored, (act.) = acting, (inc.) = incumbent (no replacement anticipated)

Anyways, it turns out that because taxes are weird, Tesla has to report any potential loss in the value of the $1.5 billion in crypto it bought last month, even if it hasn’t actually sold the bitcoin, should the holdings’ value decline before its next earnings report, according to Bloomberg. However, should the bitcoin’s value increase, Tesla cannot report that. This is because U.S. tax standards-setters (the Financial Accounting Standards Board) haven’t created any specific guidance around digital currencies. Probably wouldn’t hurt if they did, though Bloomberg Tax reports that’s not likely to happen anytime soon.

MicroStrategy is continuing its bitcoin buying binge as the cryptocurrency crosses the $50,000 level.

MicroStrategy said on Tuesday it is raising $600 million from investors to buy more bitcoin.

The technology company already owns 70,784 bitcoin, worth more than $3.5 billion on Tuesday.

MicroStrategy is continuing it bitcoin buying binge as the price of the cryptocurrency recently crossed the $50,000 level.

In a press release on Tuesday, the software technology company said it plans to raise an additional $600 million from convertible senior notes, of which all the proceeds will be used to buy more bitcoin.

MicroStrategy is the first corporation to directly purchase bitcoin, as its CEO, Michael Saylor, sought to hedge against a potential devaluation in the US dollar. Since the company's first purchase of bitcoin in August, MicroStrategy now owns 70,784 bitcoin, worth more than $3.5 billion on Tuesday.

More corporations have followed the footsteps of MicroStrategy and directly purchased bitcoin on their balance sheet, including Square, and more recently, Tesla.

The electric vehicle manufacturer acquired $1.5 billion in bitcoin in January and said it plans to begin accepting the cryptocurrency as a form of payment for its products.

This isn't the first time MicroStrategy has raised money for the sole purpose of buying more bitcoin. In December, the firm raised $400 million to add to its bitcoin holdings.

MicroStrategy has paid an average of $16,035 per bitcoin, and the move has paid off. Shares of MicroStrategy have soared 736% since the stock became a de-facto bitcoin ETF with its first purchase in August. The company's market valuation has exploded from less than $2 billion in August to more than $10 billion today.

The bet has also made CEO Michael Saylor a billionaire based on his 2.4 million share stake in the company.

Shares of MicroStrategy traded up as much as 5% in Tuesday morning trades.

In a note on Tuesday reported by Reuters, the analysts drew attention to bitcoin‘s high volatility relative to gold, the classic inflation hedge, as an obstacle to significant gains beyond current levels around $51,000.

“Bitcoin’s three-month realized volatility, or actual price moves, is 87% versus 16% for gold – an asset, proponents say it could threaten,” the investment bank said.

While bitcoin is increasingly described as “digital gold,” skeptics believe the cryptocurrency is too volatile to find wide acceptance in institutional portfolios. Even so, several publicly listed companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy have diversified cash holdings into bitcoin over recent months.

While crypto traders suggest other prominent companies are likely to follow suit, JPMorgan also said recently that bitcoin’s turbulent price action may keep corporates from emulating Tesla’s move – a sentiment echoed by Wedbush Securities on Tuesday.","Bitcoin surged above the $52,000 level on Wednesday for the first time.

The red-hot cryptocurrency rose to a record high of $52,340 at around 2:45 p.m. ET, according to data from Coin Metrics.

Bitcoin was created in 2009, not long after the global financial crisis. It has gone from a protest against the banking system to something of a ""digital gold"" that is beginning to catch on with mainstream investors.

On Wall Street, major investment banks appear to be warming to bitcoin. JPMorgan said recently it's looking seriously at the asset class, and Goldman Sachs has also shown an interest in crypto. A division of Morgan Stanley is reportedly considering adding bitcoin to its list of possible bets.

Companies like PayPal and Mastercard have made significant moves to support cryptocurrencies. And Tesla last week said it had invested $1.5 billion into bitcoin and planned to accept the digital currency as payment for its products.","And the scheme also deployed repeated ""spear-phishing campaigns"" from 2016 through early 2020 that targeted employees of the U.S. Defense Department, the State Department, and workers at U.S.-cleared defense contractors, energy firms, aerospace companies and tech firms, authorities said.

The programmers, who are part of a North Korean military intelligence agency, also are accused of creating and deploying ""multiple malicious cryptocurrency applications, and to develop and fraudulently market a blockchain platform,"" according to a Department of Justice press release.

Federal authorities said Wednesday that three North Korean computer programmers have been indicted for conducting a series of cyberattacks to attempt to steal and extort more than $1.3 billion in cash and cryptocurrency from financial institutions and companies.

Hackers also took control of bank ATMs to take out cash from them as part of the conspiracy, the indictment says.

During a press conference Wednesday, officials said that the development and marking in 2017 and 2018 of the so-called Marine Chain Token, which allowed investors to buy fractional ownership interests in marine shipping vessels with blockchain technology, allowed North Korea to ""secretly obtain funds from investors, control interests in marine shipping vessels, and evade U.S. sanctions.""

Tracy Wilkinson, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, said, ""The scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and long-running, and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering.""

Wilkinson also said, ""The conduct detailed in the indictment are the acts of a criminal nation-state that has stopped at nothing to extract revenge and obtain money to prop up its regime.""

The indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles charges Jon Chang, 31, 27-year-old Kim Il, and Park Jin Hyo 36, were members of units of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, a North Korean military intelligence agency which engaged in criminal hacking. Authorities noted that Park was previously charged in a September 2018 criminal complaint that detailed the cyberattack on Sony Pictures and the creation of the ransomware known as WannaCry.

At the same time Wednesday, officials announced that a Canadian-American citizen, 37-year-old Ghaleb Alaumary, agreed to plead guilty in a money-laundering scheme, and admitted to helping the indicted North Koreans ""cash-out"" their ""cyber-enabled bank heist.""

Authorities said that Alaumary organized teams of people in the U.S. and Canada to launder millions of dollars obtained by the hackers through ATM cash-out transactions.

The conspiracy, which officials said was motivated for revenge or financial gain, depending on the target, included the 2014 attack on Sony for its satirical movie ""The Interview,"" which depicted the assassination of North Korea, as well as the targeting of AMC Theaters, which showed the film. Another alleged target was Mammoth Screen, which was producing a fictional series that depicted a British scientist taken hostage by North Korea, and which suffered a digital intrusion in 2015.

Authorities also said that the hackers from 2015 through 2019 tried to steal more than $1.2 billion from banks in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Mexico, Malta and Africa by breaking into their computer networks and sending fraudulent messages over the SWIFT bank messaging system.

The hackers are accused of targeting hundreds of cryptocurrency companies and stealing tens of millions dollars worth of cryptocurrency as part of the scheme.

One Slovenian cryptocurrency company was ripped off of $75 million in such currency, authorities said, and the hackers stole almost $25 million worth of cryptocurrency from an Indonesian cryptocurrency company in September 2018 and $11.8 million from New York financial services firm last summer by using the malicious CryptoNeuro Trader application.

The defendants also are accused of stealing $6.1 million from BankIslami Pakistan Limited as part of a series of ATM cash-out schemes, creation of the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware in 2017, ""and the extortion and attempted extortion of victim companies,"" the DOJ said.

And the scheme also allegedly developed multiple malicious cryptocurrency applications since March 2018 that gave North Korean hackers backdoors into victims' computers. Those applications included Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, iCryptoFx, Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale, officials said.

""North Korea's operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world's leading bank robbers,"" said Assistant Attorney General John Demers of the Justice Department's National Security Division.

The case comes as the price of the leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has jumped by more than 400% over the past 12 months.

Bitcoin price has jumped more than 75% as an increasing number of corporations grow comfortable accepting it both as tender and as a store of value and medium of exchange.

At one point Wednesday, bitcoin was selling for $51,165, near its all-time record it hit earlier in the day, according to Coin Metrics.

JPMorgan has said it is considering allowing banking of cryptocurrency, and Bank of New York Mellon, the nation's oldest bank, last week said that it will soon allow digital currencies to pass through the same financial network it currently uses for more traditional holdings like U.S. Treasury bonds and stocks.

Payments companies such as PayPal and Mastercard have stepped up efforts on their platforms to support cryptocurrency processing. And electric carmaker Tesla last week disclosed in a government filing that it had invested $1.5 billion into bitcoin and planned to accept the digital currency as payment for its products.

But bitcoin's history of high-profile thefts and hacks have left some still doubting its security, particularly since it is often kept in digital wallets on independent networks.

In recent years, thieves have stolen billions of dollars' worth of bitcoin. And the digital nature of those thefts often make it difficult for authorities to track down the crooks.

- CNBC's Tom Franck contributed to this report","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged three North Korean computer programmers with theft and extortion on various allegations, including stealing over $100 million in cryptocurrencies between 2017 and 2020.

The thefts are part of a broader conspiracy in which the alleged hackers stole over $1.3 billion, the DOJ announced Wednesday. In a related second case, a Canadian-American was charged with participating in a money laundering scheme.

In a statement, Assistant Attorney General John Demers said, “As laid out in today’s indictment, North Korea’s operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world’s leading bank robbers.”

Jon Chang Hyok, Kim Il and Park Jin Hyok have been charged with criminal hacking and other crimes, and are allegedly a part of the Lazarus Group cybercrime ring, according to a press release. The three were allegedly behind the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment, which appeared to be a retaliatory move for producing The Interview, a comedy film about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The hackers targeted “hundreds of cryptocurrency companies” and stole “tens of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency,” according to the press release.

This included “$75 million from a Slovenian cryptocurrency company in December 2017; $24.9 million from an Indonesian cryptocurrency company in September 2018; and $11.8 million from a financial services company in New York in August 2020 in which the hackers used the malicious CryptoNeuro Trader application as a backdoor,” the press release said.

Just last week, the United Nations alleged that North Korea was funding its nuclear weapons program using funds from hacked cryptocurrency exchanges, alongside other thefts. The U.N. believes that over $300 million in crypto assets have been stolen by various North Korean hackers.

Initial coin offerings

The defendants raised funds using initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well, the indictment alleged. Specifically, it claims that Kim Il tried raising funds through the Marine Chain ICO, which the U.N. suspected was affiliated with the North Korean government last year.

The defendants created a digital token representing fractional ownership in marine shipping vessels and marketed it to individuals in Singapore, the indictment alleged.

“Defendant KIM IL and other conspirators would not disclose to these individuals that the conspirators were DPRK citizens or that they were communicating using false and fraudulent names. They also would not disclose to investors that a purpose of the Marine Chain Token was to evade United States sanctions on North Korea,” the indictment said.

It’s unclear how much the Marine Chain ICO raised.

Evan Kohlmann, the chief innovation officer of cybersecurity and risk intelligence firm Flashpoint, told CoinDesk, “Countries like North Korea will continue to create schemes to avoid U.S. sanctions. The DoJ indictment highlights the breadth of North Korean malicious cyber intrusions targeting entertainment, finance, defense, energy, government, and technology companies.”

Countries could try cashing out through ATMs in addition to using ICOs or malware to steal cryptocurrencies, he said.

Advisory

In addition to Wednesday’s indictment, the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Department of Treasury published a joint advisory about a crypto malware produced by North Korea.

The advisory, which includes seven malware analysis reports (MARs) with technical details about the AppleJeus malware, details how the program was installed on victim machines.

“This report catalogues AppleJeus malware in detail. North Korea has used AppleJeus malware posing as cryptocurrency trading platforms since at least 2018. In most instances, the malicious application – seen on both Windows and Mac operating systems – appears to be from a legitimate cryptocurrency trading company, thus fooling individuals into downloading it as a third-party application from a website that seems legitimate,” the notice said.

The threat actors targeted companies in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, India, China, Russia, Israel, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and over a dozen others, according to the alert.

Canada's financial regulator approved the second publicly traded bitcoin ETF in North America.

The Evolve Bitcoin ETF will trade on the Toronto stock exchange.

The approval comes just days after Canada signed off on the first North American publicly traded bitcoin fund, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) approved the second-ever bitcoin ETF from Evolve Funds on Tuesday just days after approving the Purpose Bitcoin ETF on February 12.

The Evolve Bitcoin ETF seeks to provide investors with exposure to the daily price movements of the US dollar price of bitcoin. Crypto enthusiasts see an exchange-traded fund as a way for more retail investors to gain price exposure to bitcoin. An ETF trades on the stock market, and investors won't need to set up a crypto wallet to invest.

The Evolve ETF will trade on the Toronto stock exchange under the tickers ""EBIT"" and ""EBIT.U.""

The Canadian regulator's approval of two bitcoin ETFs has boosted optimism that the US Securities and Exchange commission will finally approve a similar vehicle in the US. Several firms have filed, but have so far failed to gain approval, for a bitcoin ETF in the past, with the SEC typically citing security concerns.

""Now that the OSC has said that if a product is well constructed enough the crypto market is sufficiently mature for these types of financial products, the industry's attention inevitably turns south of the border to the US,"" said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks. ""Will the SEC finally decide that the time is right for a Bitcoin ETF?""

The Evolve bitcoin ETF will track the regulated Bitcoin Reference Rate from CF Benchmarks. The fund will directly own bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain in a cold wallet, and the Fund's holdings will be priced based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, a once-a-day benchmark index price for bitcoin denominated in US dollars, according to a press release.

Cidel Trust Company will be the custodian of the ETF while Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss' Gemini Trust Company will be the sub-custodian. Ernst and Young will be the auditor of the fund.","While 2020 was a significant year for Bitcoin (BTC), the just-begun year of 2021 is already full of great surprises. On Feb. 8, Bitcoin’s price jumped by almost $3,000 in minutes, then it surged 20% in 24 hours — all due to the news of Elon Musk’s Tesla allocating $1.5 billion of its balance sheet to BTC.

The same week, the oldest bank in the United States, Bank of New York Mellon, announced plans to hold, transfer and issue Bitcoin. Mastercard is also planning to support cryptocurrencies in 2021 for its almost 1 billion users. And SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, commonly referred to as “Crypto Mom” in the crypto community, even underlined the urgent necessity for regulatory clarity due to the recent events in the space.

With PayPal, Tesla, Mastercard, BNY Mellon and others entering the cryptosphere, isn’t it becoming more clear than ever before that digital assets are now part of the mainstream? That their mass adoption has started and it is a matter of the present, not the future?

Last year, Cointelegraph asked experts in the crypto and blockchain industries for their opinions on PayPal’s crypto integration and mass adoption and on the importance of 2020 in Bitcoin’s history. This time, the question is: What does Tesla’s recent $1.5 billion investment into Bitcoin mean for the crypto space in terms of the financial markets, for crypto adoption and brand building, and for the whole industry in general?

Alex Tapscott, managing director at Ninepoint Partners:

“Tesla’s purchase of Bitcoin no doubt sent a shockwave through the corner offices of every chief financial officer and corporate treasurer in America and beyond. One of Bitcoin’s many benefits is that it acts like digital gold, diversifying corporate holdings and lowering currency risk. Every financial executive ought to be sharpening their pencils to understand if and ultimately when they should be buying it.

While Tesla is not the first public company to buy Bitcoin for its treasury, it is by far the most important. How poetic it is that Elon Musk, a space entrepreneur, pushed Bitcoin to its escape velocity in corporate America!

The decision by Tesla follows a slew of high-profile announcements by large companies, which fits a pattern of accelerating institutional and corporate adoption. Equally consequential to the treasury allocation was Tesla’s decision to accept Bitcoin. This follows in the footsteps of several other large innovative firms such as PayPal, Visa and others that are building a superhighway to Bitcoin mass adoption, enabling not only Bitcoin buying and selling but integration into their merchant networks. By the end of 2021, I’d expect many more firms to not only hold Bitcoin but have a real Bitcoin strategy.”

Da Hongfei, founder of Neo and founder and CEO of Onchain:

“This is a very promising sign for mainstream interest and its increasing willingness to embrace blockchain. Moreover, it affirms that blockchain and Bitcoin are here to stay for the future.

Throughout 2020, increasingly more financial institutions invested in Bitcoin, and I am confident that blockchain adoption is accelerating as the global financial paradigm shifts to fully embrace digitization and decentralization. Moving forward, we must continue pushing for effective standards across the industry as well as greater integration to fully deliver on blockchain’s game-changing potential.”

John Wu, president of Ava Labs:

“Tesla’s purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin not only continues the momentum of public companies purchasing crypto but could be a watershed moment that establishes some allocation of digital assets as a cornerstone of a healthy, diversified treasury.

Regardless of industry, businesses should follow these early adopters establishing in-roads to the payment rails and financial infrastructure of the future. That starts with Bitcoin and will steadily expand to projects that are just outside the frame and focused on the programmable, smart asset side of the ecosystem where enterprises can find more use cases beyond digital gold.”

Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys and co-founder of Ethereum:

“The embrace of Bitcoin and Ether by institutional investors and corporate treasury departments in recent months represents a watershed moment for the global economy — the early concrete signs of a paradigm shift in how global business, financial and economic systems will be constructed. They are being rearchitected on a new real-time automated, objective trust foundation, as represented by the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks.

Today, corporate finance departments are learning how to manage BTC and ETH tokens for value preservation, transaction friction reduction and upside, as these systems will grow in size and value dramatically with adoption over the next few years. Tomorrow, their treasuries will plug into the decentralized finance protocols being built largely on Ethereum for borrowing, lending, trading, equity and bond issuance, full lifecycle token management, insurance, prediction markets, trade finance, tokenization and factorization of invoices, loyalty tokens and NFT art that can be projected on the walls of their board rooms. They will do this because they will be able to configure and issue financial instruments without the need for intermediaries, and they will be able to wire up financial flows to suit their needs in real time. And they will do this because that’s where the liquidity is.”

Michael Terpin, founder and CEO of Transform Group:

“Tesla’s bold move to invest $1.5 billion of its treasury into Bitcoin, as well as to accept Bitcoin as payment for Tesla vehicles in some jurisdictions, blows the doors wide open for corporate America and high-net-worth families to seriously consider putting a small part of their net worth in Bitcoin as a store of value, instead of bonds, gold, dividend stocks and commercial real estate, which have been underperforming historical standards.

With only 18.6 million Bitcoin in the world — and perhaps as much as 4 million to 5 million lost or not being offered for sale — there isn’t enough to satisfy the demand of 46.5 million global millionaires, nor 1% to 5% of the estimated $4 trillion of cash on corporate balance sheets in the U.S. alone. Add in 1.8 billion millennials, mostly in countries with broken currencies or banking systems, and one can see that the supply of and demand for Bitcoin are not in balance.

Over time, this demand will trickle down to Ethereum, which already has a large part of the Fortune 500 developing applications on it, as well as innovative cryptocurrency platforms in DeFi and NFTs — and numerous billionaires, including Mark Cuban, have recently hopped on those bandwagons. We are in the year after the halving — what I call ‘Bitcoin summer’ — and parabolic growth has occurred following every four-year halving event so far. This year will likely not be an exception.”

Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo:

“In the face of the pandemic, domestic inflation and global uncertainty, mainstream businesses have jumped into digital assets with newfound enthusiasm. From public companies like Tesla and Square to funds like Grayscale and the Tudor Group, prominent institutions are increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. In aggregate, these institutions are estimated to be holding over 6% of the 18.6 million Bitcoin in circulation, amounting to over 1.2 million BTC. After Bitcoin surpassed an all-time high of over $48,000 in early February, the total value of these institutional holdings eclipsed $55 billion.

In the last six months, BitGo has onboarded many corporate accounts through the process of education, intelligent market access, asset accounting and reporting, and more — all while keeping assets stored in regulated, qualified custody with the highest levels of security for deep cold storage.

Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance stands to only grow exponentially as more institutional investors embrace cryptocurrencies, clearing the way for future entrants to follow them. This escalating market demand from large entities will likely continue impacting Bitcoin’s value and may even serve to mitigate its volatility. With the final Bitcoin expected to be mined in 2140 and over $2 trillion of monthly trade volume, there’s still plenty of time to enter Bitcoin — for businesses and individuals alike. Despite the tremendous acceleration of institutional investors, we are likely only at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to mass adoption. Additional corporations and funds are soon to see the success that these first-movers have enjoyed and thus will begin to follow their lead.”

Scott Freeman, co-founder and partner of JST Capital:

“The recent announcement by Elon Musk of Tesla’s investment in Bitcoin is yet another example of the broadening acceptance of Bitcoin, and of digital assets as an asset class in its own right. We are quickly getting to the point where announcements like this will no longer be viewed as ‘news’ and will no longer cause reactions in the market.

Take for example the recent announcement by BNY Mellon, which we think is more important but caused not a stir in the market. Taking a step back, we think the success of Bitcoin, and of digital assets more broadly, is a strong harbinger of the power of global retail-driven innovation in financial markets. Look at the recent activity in GameStop as another example. We think this trend will continue and will raise important policy and regulatory issues that will need to be addressed by governments and central banks around the globe.”

Tim Draper, founder of Draper Associates and Draper Fisher Jurvetson:

“When I tweeted at Elon about accepting Bitcoin three weeks ago, I had no idea he would be so responsive, first by accepting Bitcoin and next by managing his cash by buying some Bitcoin. I expect that the action he has taken will be pervasive, first for the early adopter companies that use OpenNode or the Lightning Network to accept Bitcoin, and next for the chief financial officers of the world to recognize the need to own some Bitcoin to hedge against coming inflation and against further printing of fiat currency by politicians.”

In this article, we examine the debate.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are assets that top the rating of cryptocurrencies. For most people, even those to whom these names say something - it's twin brothers, alternative and competing organizations. For those who are deeply interested in blockchain issues - fundamentally different technologies.

Ethereum and Bitcoin: parallels and rivalries of major cryptocurrencies

Understanding the fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, allows us to move to the comparison of the assets of ETH and BTC. It will allow us to determine what is better - Bitcoin or Ethereum, if we are talking about investing and mining. Before we move on to defining the pros and cons, it is worth listing the common traits:

Both resources are mined and traded;

Special wallets are needed to store the key codes that ensure ownership;

Trading in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, takes place on the platforms of exchanges;

The value of both cryptocurrencies largely depends on the supply and demand, that is, is prone to jumps in connection with the events of the industry.

Ethereum transactions make it difficult only to reduce the prevalence of this asset, although the situation is gradually rectified.

Ethereum is also faster when it comes to transactions. This trend is especially noticeable in crypto gambling, which has been developing rapidly in recent years. Despite the fact that fast transactions was something always associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum managed to snatch the title of ""fastest crypto"" years ago. It is quite easy to prove this fact - as soon as you sign up with one of the Ethereum casinos reviewed here and make deposits or withdrawals you can be sure that the funds will be available on your account in just seconds.

The pros of Bitcoin

There are so many people talking about the advantages of Bitcoin that this is its main plus. Attention provides buying, buying - rising price, price increase - an opportunity to get passive income or earn on the course. But bitcoin also has significant advantages:

Banks, business sharks, and big investors are already behind the most important of cryptocurrencies. This negates the chance to depreciate at once: Bitcoin can already be considered a reliable asset. It is easier to work with Bitcoin coins: almost all exchanges, trading platforms and even payment systems have added it to the list of assets. This simplifies transactions, buying and selling opportunities, and transferring to fiat money. Terminals for ""cashing out"" Bitcoin are not uncommon. On the Internet, this cryptocurrency is accepted by many services and even online stores. The economic model of Bitcoin, which initially limits the total volume of coins, so works for miners. There will be no oversupply of the resource, that is, there will be no reduction in the cost due to saturation.

Ethereum advantages

Ethereum is a second-generation cryptocurrency that has been aptly nicknamed Bitcoin 2.0. The creators of Ether were able to prevent errors of the prototype and exclude them from their product. The benefits of the Ethereum digital asset are:

The system is designed for mining with small capacities, the developers deliberately chose the target audience of miners with small and medium-performance PCs;

The Ethereum block is optimized: scaling provides a high transaction rate. For Bitcoin, the processing time is up to 2 minutes, Ethereum - 10-15 seconds.

Ghost’s own code and protocol allow you to get rewarded from blocks you've already mined. This type of earnings is added to mining and profits from cranes.

The MetaMask app allows you to work with the Ethereum blockchain directly from the browser. So far, it's only Chrome, but over time, the developers plan to add other bundles.

Mining Ethereum outside the pool with its own resources is still a reality.

The reward for Ether for miners does not decrease with time, in Bitcoin every 4 years it is reduced threefold. The duration and amount of production in the Ethereum ecosystem are not limited.

Ether is a consumable for creating applications in the Ethereum environment, meaning it needs at least some programmers and optimizers. This ensures the demand for it, although it strongly divides the audience interested in dominant cryptocurrencies.

To put it simply: consumers of Ethereum will remain working with smart contracts representatives of business and IT-sphere, and Bitcoin will buy ordinary user goods and services.

Ether prospects: what are the chances of bypassing Bitcoin?

The above advantages of the cryptocurrency, which is still occupying the second position, make you seriously wonder whether the leadership of Bitcoin is so sustainable. The rise of BTC provided a high, raised around the media system. Experts, who consider digital smart contracts the most promising platform for business, political technologies, and storage systems, believe that the first drop in interest in Bitcoin will lead to the automatic rise of the real Ethereum consumed. Tokens, which will be in demand for many years, which will ensure an increase in the price of ETH.","The bitcoin price broke past the vaunted $51,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday Cesc Maymo/Getty Images

MicroStrategy has increased its convertible debt offering to about $1 billion from $600 million as it seeks to buy more bitcoin.

MicroStrategy owns nearly 71,000 bitcoin since its first purchase last summer, now worth more than $3 billion.

Bitcoin surged to more than $51,700 on Wednesday as investors continue to buy into the cryptocurrency.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

MicroStrategy is continuing to feed its bitcoin buying binge with even more cash than originally planned.

The software technology company has increased the size of its convertible debt offering, first announced on Tuesday, to about $1 billion from $600 million.

According to an SEC filing, MicroStrategy's debt offering is now $900 million, with an option for the offering to be upsized by an additional $150 million if demand from investors materializes.

The company intends to use all of the proceeds to add more bitcoin to its balance sheet. MicroStrategy is the first corporation to invest in bitcoin, as its CEO, Michael Saylor, sought to hedge against a potential devaluation in the US dollar.

Heavy hitters like Square and Tesla have followed its lead in recent months.

Square purchased $50 million worth of bitcoin in October, and Tesla acquired $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency in January, with plans to accept it as a form of payment for its products in the near future.

MicroStrategy owns 70,784 bitcoin at an average price of $16,035 per bitcoin. The stake was worth $3.7 billion after bitcoin hit a high of $51,721 in Wednesday trades.

This isn't the first time MicroStrategy has raised money for the sole purpose of buying more bitcoin. In December, the firm raised $400 million to add to its bitcoin holdings. The bet has made CEO Michael Saylor a billionaire based on his 2.4 million share stake in the company.

Shares of MicroStrategy fell as much as 6% in Wednesday trades.

Markets Insider"
2021-02-18,"TOKYO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Bitcoin is an “economic side show” and a poor hedge against a decline in equity prices, analysts at JP Morgan said in a sobering assessment that could undercut the cryptocurrency’s rise to record highs.

Current prices are well above JP Morgan’s estimates of fair value and the mainstream adoption of bitcoin increases its correlation with cyclical assets, which reduces the benefits of diversifying into bitcoin, the investment bank said in a memo.

Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, last traded at $51,116 on Friday, down from a record high of $52,640 reached on Wednesday. Rival cryptocurrency ether traded near a record of $1,951 reached earlier on Friday.

Bitcoin has surged by 45% so far this month, fuelled by signs it is winning acceptance among mainstream investors and companies, such as Tesla, Mastercard and BNY Mellon, but many observers remain sceptical of the unregulated and highly volatile digital asset.

“Crypto assets continue to rank as the poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities, with questionable diversification benefits at prices so far above production costs, while correlations with cyclical assets are rising as crypto ownership is mainstreamed,” analysts at JP Morgan said.

Some of bitcoin’s supporters argue that the cryptocurrency is “digital” gold that can hedge against inflation and declines in the dollar.

Based on that logic, bitcoin would need to rise to $146,000 in the long-term for its market capitalisation to equal total private-sector investment in gold via exchange-traded funds or bars and coins, according to JP Morgan.

Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk said on Thursday that owning bitcoin was only a little better than holding cash. He also defended Tesla’s recent purchase of $1.5 billion of bitcoin, which re-ignited mainstream interest in the digital currency.

According to the Zug Canton website, residents can request to pay taxes in cryptocurrency and will be emailed a link taking them to the crypto payment option.","FILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during a conversation with legendary game designer Todd Howard (not pictured) at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2019.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk on Thursday said that owning bitcoin was only a little better than holding conventional cash, but that the slight difference made it a better asset to hold.

“However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere,” Musk said in a tweet. “Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is ‘almost’.”

He also defended Tesla’s action to invest in bitcoin, saying that the difference with cash made it “adventurous enough” for the S&P 500 company to hold the cryptocurrency.

Tesla’s $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase set the cryptocurrency soaring toward this week’s record peak above $50,000 while Musk’s recent promotion of dogecoin on Twitter also lifted the price of that cryptocurrency.

FILE PHOTO: Representation of the Ethereum virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

The virtual currency reached an all-time peak of $1,938 and was last up 4.6% at $1,936.94.

The CME last week launched futures on ether, the digital currency or token that facilitates transactions on the ethereum blockchain. In the crypto world, the terms ether and ethereum have become interchangeable.

Increasing institutional participation in cryptocurrencies also propelled bitcoin, the largest and most popular crypto asset, to an all-time peak of $52,640 on Wednesday.

“Ethereum is really undervalued, and I believe it has been ... due to its more complex narrative,” said Luis Cuende, co-founder of Aragon, a decentralized application on the ethereum blockchain.

“A global computing network for Web3 (internet 3.0) is extremely exciting and new. I would say over the next three months, we could see ethereum hit $2,500.”

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is currently in consolidation mode after hitting a record high. It was last down 0.3% at $52,000. Among the mainstream investors and companies that have recently jumped on bitcoin’s bandwagon were Tesla, Mastercard, and BNY Mellon.

Jeffrey Gundlach, the billionaire chief executive of investment firm DoubleLine Capital, is the latest of the traditional investors who seemed to have a change of heart on bitcoin. He said in a tweet on Thursday that bitcoin may be the stimulus asset, not gold, adding that “lots of liquid poured into a funnel creates a torrent.”

Last month, Gundlach said he was neutral on bitcoin due to its volatility, which was a downgrade of his outlook from overweight.

Another beneficiary of bitcoin’s climb as a mainstream asset was the surge in trading volume for Purpose Bitcoin ETF, the world’s first bitcoin exchange traded fund, which was approved by Canadian regulators. Purpose started trading on Thursday.

More than C$80 million of Purpose were traded in the first few hours after its launch. By comparison, volume for the Bitcoin Fund, a closed-end investment fund, was about C$30 million.

CME data, meanwhile, showed nearly 1,900 ETH futures contracts were traded for the first five days after last week’s launch or about 92,800 ether, equivalent to roughly $160 million.

Around 27% of volume came from outside the United States and more than 33% traded during non-U.S. trading hours.

(1 U.S. dollar = C$1.2698)","Nvidia Corp. on Thursday introducing a specialized product for mining cryptocurrency while throttling mining capabilities in their lower-priced gaming cards, an attempt to avoid a replay of difficulties caused by demand from crypto miners in recent years.

Nvidia NVDA, +1.48% and rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.50% have struggled to produce enough graphics-processing units, or GPUs, to satisfy demand from bloggers as well as server customers and others amid a global chip shortage. In a blog post, Nvidia announced Thursday that its RTX 3060 gaming graphics processing unit will use software to halve performance of the card if cryptocurrency mining is detected, with mining of the cryptocurrency ethereum ETHUSD, -6.62% singled out. Nvidia confirmed that the throttling will only apply to its 3060 card due out on Feb. 25.

“Ethereum has the highest global mining yield for any GPU-mineable coin at the moment, and thus is likely the main demand driver for GPUs in mining,” an Nvidia spokesman told MarketWatch in emailed comments.

“Other algorithms do not contribute significantly to GPU demand and this cannot change quickly due to network effects within a given cryptocurrency,” the spokesman said. “The rate limiter applies to anything that uses Dagger Hashimoto or Ethash-like algorithms.”

The move is to ensure the card gets into the hands of gamers, which have been clamoring over cards that are in short supply, and potentially avoid a repeat of issues caused by demand from crypto miners in the past. Back in late 2018, Nvidia was left with a glut of gaming card inventory after cryptocurrency prices plunged, drying up interest in mining and creating a “crypto hangover” that damaged the company’s financials for nearly an entire year.

To that end, the company said it was releasing a dedicated mining chip, the Nvidia Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, which offers GPU performance but not the graphics features used in gaming. Lower performance models of the chip, the 30HX and 40HX models, will be available in the first quarter, while higher performance models, the 50HX and the 90HX, will be available in the second quarter, Nvidia said. According to the company, the 90HX offers about three times the ethereum-mining performance than the 30HX

Nvidia did not list a price for its CMP, while its budget-priced 3060 card, which was announced in January, nominally lists at $329. An Nvidia spokesperson told MarketWatch the company is not announcing pricing for the CMP at this time and that the first models will roll out in March.

Recently, bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.45% prices cleared $50,000 for the first time, while ethereum prices have surged past $1,900 to record highs. Even cryptocurrencies like dogecoin, initially created as a joke, have surged more than 900% in price this year.

In 2018, ethereum prices crashed from a high of more than $1,300 in January to a low of less than $85 by December that year. Similarly, bitcoin started 2018 at more than $10,000 and ended the year below $3,700.","BNB, the exchange token of Binance, has become the third largest crypto by market capitalization for the first time as its price rally continues.

Data from CoinGecko and Binance-owned CoinMarketCap both show that BNB's market capitalization has surpassed that of Tether around 4:00 UTC on Friday. As of writing, BNB's market cap stands at $34.4 billion.

BNB has mostly remained as one of the top 10 coins by market cap in the past. CoinMarketCap's most recent snapshot on January 31 showed that BNB was ranked at the 10th spot back then when its price was changing hands at around $40.

But BNB's price has rallied towards above $230 as of writing, which has almost six-folded within weeks.

As The Block Research mapped out in a piece on Thursday, one feature that Binance created for BNB since September is using it as the native token for its Binance Smart Chain that seeks to take advantage of the boom of decentralized finance.

""While Binance Smart Chain has made tradeoffs in that it is far more centralized than networks like Ethereum, it has used the demand for DeFi activity and the high fees environment to its advantage,"" wrote The Block analyst John Dantoni, who identified 103 projects and companies across 13 different verticals expanding on the BSC ecosystem.","Why did this happen?

The stock trading app has become really popular with younger Millennial and Gen Z investors. The Robinhood platform lets customers purchase, sell, and hold digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) via its platform. However, users had not been able to withdraw these crypto-assets to other online wallets.

Last month, Robinhood had decided to temporarily restrict a feature on its app that allowed people to purchase crypto securities instantly, because of the highly volatile market conditions resulting from the trading frenzy in shares of GameStop (GME). Robinhood faced a lot of criticism from users who complained about not being able to move their funds to external wallets.

In a series of tweets posted on Wednesday, Robinhood’s management clarified that they do not currently invest in cryptocurrencies or use any customer crypto-assets for the company’s benefit.

So much interest in Crypto! To be crystal clear 🔍, we fully intend to provide the ability to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies, including DOGE. Robinhood Crypto does NOT currently invest in cryptocurrency or use any customer cryptocurrency for our own benefit. — Robinhood (@RobinhoodApp) February 17, 2021

As reported, the House Committee on Financial Services will hold the first of three hearings on the Gamestop – Robinhood saga that saw hedge fund short sellers compelled to sell positions in a short squeeze driven by collaborative trading that was organized on Reddit.

Entitled, “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,” the hearing will include testimony from Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev as well as Executives from Citadel, Reddit, and Melvin Capital. Keith Gill, active on the subreddit Wallstreetbets and known by his handles like DeepFuckingValue and Roaring Kitty, will also participate.

Recently added was Jennifer Schulp, Director of Financial Regulation Studies at Cato Institute.

In advance of the hearing, scheduled to kick off tomorrow (February 18, 2020), beginning at 12 noon, several witnesses have posted prepared testimony in advance of the hearing.

Tenev says that Robinhood has changed the investing world for the better by removing traditional barriers to millions of retail investors.

Tenev states:

“Our rapid growth has confirmed that retail investors were waiting for the right platform to help them enter the markets. We have over 13 million customers, and we are seeing new customers open accounts every day to take part in our financial markets. Robinhood Financial’s customers trade thousands of stocks and ETFs, as well as options and cryptocurrency—all with zero commissions and no account minimums.”

As covered recently, Tiger Global is reportedly planning to lead a $200 million round in Robinhood competitor Public.com.

As reported last week, the Robinhood app was downloaded over 1 million times during a span of seven days, which could have been the “best” and “worst” period for the company, analysts have argued.

While commenting on the recent Reddit / GameStop saga, Lee A. Schneider, the General Counsel at Block.one, one of the world’s largest blockchain companies and creator of the EOSIO blockchain protocol, has noted:

“Fellow DeFi adherents, let’s slow down on the outrage about GameStop (NYSE:GME) and the traditional finance system (TradFi). Blockchain and DeFi offer lots of advantages over TradFi, but TradFi is not completely broken and DeFi is not necessarily vastly superior. Two core characteristics make them look very similar in a way that undercuts the criticism and negative judgments against TradFi.”

He further explained that “first, DeFi and TradFi both require collateralization, they just implement it in different ways.” He added that “second, just like collateralization can break down in TradFi, DeFi has a significant exploit that lessens the effectiveness of the collateralization requirement.”

The price of bitcoin crossed another major milestone Friday, as the cryptocurrency's market value surpassed $1 trillion, according to Coindesk. The digital currency was trading at just under $54,000 per coin Friday as it hit the new level, and rose above $55,000 later in the session for a daily gain of more than 6%, according to Coin Metrics. The price of bitcoin has now gained about 360% over the past six months. Before the recent surge, the digital asset has never traded above $20,000.

The move has been fueled in part by increased adoption of bitcoin by major investors and companies. The oldest bank in the United States, the Bank of New York Mellon, announced earlier this month that it was moving into the space. Elon Musk's Tesla converted some of its balance sheet cash into bitcoin earlier this year and said it would start accepting the digital tokens as payment. Bitcoin ""has started to get so big that it arguably creates its own demand as companies and institutions begin to make forays into a field they wouldn't have touched a few months previously,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim Reid said in a note. ""Ironically it is turning itself into a credible asset class to many by rallying so much of late and also by getting increasing institutional buy-in.""","Why did this happen?

Bitcoin’s market value reached $1 trillion for the first time, a surge that’s helping cryptocurrency returns far outstrip the performance of more traditional assets like stocks and gold.

The largest token has added more than $450 billion of value in 2021 to about $1 trillion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which includes bitcoin and four other coins, has more than doubled.

Speculators, corporate treasurers and institutional investors are thought to have stoked bitcoin’s volatile ascent. Crypto believers are dueling with skeptics for the dominant narrative around the climb: the former see an asset being embraced for its ability to hedge risks such as inflation, while the latter sense a precarious mania riding atop waves of monetary and fiscal stimulus.

At the same time, the argument has been made that assigning a market capitalization isn’t an accurate representation since Bitcoin isn’t a company or even an asset. Skeptics say without real-work assets that companies possess or government backing like the dollar, all investors are really buying into is faith in the cryptocurrency’s network.

Still, FOMO — fear of missing out — may be at play, said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy with AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney, adding that “in times of easy money this gets magnified and it’s partly what’s driving the current interest.”

The crypto index’s performance towers over stocks, gold, commodities and bonds in 2021.

This month, Tesla Inc. disclosed a $1.5 billion investment and MicroStrategy Inc. boosted a sale of convertible bonds to $900 million to buy even more of the token. That brought the coin closer to corporate America.

“If companies’ fundamentals are going to become closely tied to movements in Bitcoin because they’ve suddenly become speculators on the side, we’re going to be in bubble territory before you know it,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst with Oanda Europe Ltd.

Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk posted a somewhat cryptic tweet Friday that appeared in part to defend the company’s action, saying bitcoin “is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash” while adding that the electric vehicle maker’s decision isn’t “directly reflective of my opinion.”

The “long bitcoin” trade is seen as among the most crowded in the world alongside technology exposure and dollar shorts, according to the February edition of Bank of America’s global fund manager survey.

AMP’s Oliver said if bitcoin “falls out of favor — for example due to government regulation or investors just moving on to the next new thing — then it could quickly plunge.”","Bitcoin's market value reaches $1 trillion as crypto believers pile in to the world's biggest digital token, pushing its price past $56,000, another record.

Bitcoin’s market value reached $1 trillion for the first time on Friday, smashing through $56,000 as investors and backers including Elon Musk and Tesla (TSLA) - Get Report pushed the world's biggest digital token into record territory.

At last check, bitcoin traded at $56,078, up 7.79%, according to CoinDesk. The largest token has added more than $415 billion of value in 2021, far higher returns than other assets like stocks and gold, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has been fueled in part by speculators betting it will be the dominant digital currency, but also by institutional investors who are buying into the idea that bitcoin specifically is “digital gold” - an asset class that has equal if not great chances of retaining its value, and in turn being a hedge against risks such as inflation.

Tesla founder and co-CEO Elon Musk defended Tesla’s $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin on Friday saying in a tweet that it is “simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash,” adding that the electric vehicle maker’s decision isn’t “directly reflective of my opinion.”

To be clear, I am not an investor, I am an engineer,” Musk said on Twitter. ""I don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.”

Other corporate players including Bank of New York Mellon BK have said they will now allow clients to hold bitcoin in their portfolios. And business software company MicroStrategy MSTR announced this week that it was issuing $600 million in bonds to buy bitcoin.

Meantime, Purpose Investments' Purpose Bitcoin ETF, the first North American exchange-traded fund for bitcoin, officially began trading on Thursday. The fund opened at C$10.59 (US$8.35) on volume of 9.3 million shares. It last traded at C$9.94 o the Toronto Stock Exchange.

""We believe the story and theme here is much larger than just investing in bitcoin and predicting its future price, but rather around the potential ramifications that crypto, blockchain, and bitcoin could have across the technology and corporate world for the next decade,"" Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives said in a research note on Friday.

From Paypal (PYPL) - Get Report, and Square (SQ) - Get Report, to the likes of Nvidia (NVDA) - Get Report, Tesla, IBM (IBM) - Get Report, Visa (V) - Get Report, Mastercard (MA) - Get Report, we believe the trend of transactions, bitcoin investments, and blockchain-driven initiatives could surge over the coming years as this bitcoin mania is not a fad, in our opinion, but the start of a new age on the digital currency front.""","NEW YORK/LONDON : Billionaire Elon Musk defended Tesla Inc.’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment on Twitter, calling the cryptocurrency a “less dumb"" version of cash.

“When fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere,"" Musk said in a reference to the sub-zero returns on cash caused by negative-yielding debt. The comments pushed Bitcoin to a record on Friday, with prices climbing above $53,000.

In a sense, Musk’s comments sum up one of the big issues facing markets this year. With so much cash being pumped into the financial system from governments fighting the pandemic, investors are increasingly worried about inflation and looking for alternative places to put their money.

“Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&P 500 company,"" Musk wrote, adding that Tesla’s decision to buy Bitcoin doesn’t directly reflect his opinion.

“Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is ‘almost,’"" he added.

Tesla’s action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&P500 company. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 19, 2021

Bitcoin was up as much as 2.4% to $53,263 as of 9:55 am Friday in New York. Just this week, prices have jumped about 10%.

Musk’s posts were in response to remarks by Binance Holdings Ltd.’s chief Changpeng Zhao. In a Bloomberg Television interview, Zhao wondered why Tesla bought Bitcoin if he’s so “gung-ho"" on Dogecoin. Musk said he’s an engineer, not an investor, and doesn’t own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.

This year, the billionaire has tweeted about cryptocurrency-related topics more frequently, with his memes and jokes about Bitcoin and Dogecoin -- a tongue-in-cheek digital currency -- often moving markets.

Share Via","The first in the Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) series will focus on Ether mining, used to make the Ethereum cryptocurrency possible, and is set to release in March.

GPU giant Nvidia plans to release a processor designed for mining cryptocurrency Ethereum, and will put artificial limits on how effective its future GPUs are at mining.

CMP chips will not do graphics processing, Nvidia said. Unlike gaming-focused GeForce GPUs, they also lack display outputs, enabling improved airflow while mining so they can be more densely packed. CMPs also have a lower peak core voltage and frequency, which improves mining power efficiency, the company said.

""Creating tailored products for customers with specific needs delivers the best value for customers,"" Matt Wuebbling, head of global GeForce marketing, said.

""With CMP, we can help miners build the most efficient data centers while preserving GeForce RTX GPUs for gamers.""

At the same time, Nvidia plans to reduce the hash rate of Ethereum mining by around 50 percent on its upcoming RTX 3060 graphics cards - intentionally using software to make them worse at crypto mining. This will not affect existing GPUs, the company said.

It is not the first time that Nvidia has used artificial restraints to limit the sale of chips to certain industries. In 2018, it updated the EULA on consumer-focused GeForce GPUs to prohibit data center use - instead pushing data center companies towards the significantly more expensive enterprise GPU line. It claimed that the move was simply due to GeForce not being designed for the data center, but continued to use the chip in its own facilities for the GeForce Now cloud gaming service.

Nvidia has claimed that the new CMP chips will not affect the production of GeForce products, which have been out of stock for most of 2020 and 2021. Limited supply, caused by a global semiconductor shortage, has been made worse by booming crypto demand as Bitcoin and Ethereum hit record highs.

Instead, Nvidia argues, the new product line and software restrictions will ensure that future GeForce supplies will only go towards gamers.

There is another benefit to Nvidia that may have led to its decision to create a new product category. Cryptocurrency mining is a boom and bust industry, built on tight margins. During the last bitcoin bubble, GPU supplies were again heavily constrained - but when bitcoin's price fell precipitously, miners were forced to sell their equipment en masse, flooding the market with cheap GPUs. This cut heavily into Nvidia's profits as second-hand GPU prices fell, making purchasing a new one less appealing. Q4 2018 was ""an extraordinary, unusually turbulent, and disappointing quarter,"" CEO Jensen Huang said at the time.

Now, should Ethereum prices collapse, miners will only be able to sell CMPs to other miners.","Ether (ETHUSD), the digital currency native to the Ethereum ecosystem, is nearing a $2,000 milestone as more institutional buyers have boosted their positions in recent weeks. One Ether is currently equal to $1,962.09, an increase of more than 22 times compared to a year ago.

""We believe investors are looking to diversify and are growing increasingly comfortable with Ethereum fundamentals,"" wrote James Butterfill, an investment strategist at CoinShares, in a research note on Feb. 8. The asset manager noted that the total fund flows were ""unusually focused"" on Ethereum, with 80% of the totaling $245 million allocated to Ethereum.

Grayscale Investment Holdings, the biggest global crypto asset manager, now has 3.16 million Ether under management as of Feb. 18, with Ether accumulation showing the biggest change in its portfolio over the past seven days, according to data compiled by bybt.com.

Institutional buyers, inclusion by companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL), and praise from individual investors like Mark Cuban have helped to make the case for ether. Cuban has said ""ETH has an advantage over bitcoin as a store of value,"" noting he's buying more Ether, not Bitcoin (BTCUSD), in an interview with The Defiant podcast.

That makes sense, as Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency by design, allowing for so-called ""smart contracts"" on the blockchain. ""Thanks so Ethereum, a blockchain could be about much more than digital currency,"" writes Jeff Roberts in his book Kings of Crypto: One Startup's Quest to Take Cryptocurrency Out of Silicon Valley and Onto Wall Street. ""It was now also a one-stop shop where people could sign contracts over anything from sports wagers to investment agreements to data storage.""

In that sense, Roberts compares Ethereum to an ecosystem like Apple, Inc. (AAPL). ""It served as a platform much like what Apple provides developers so they can build apps for its iOS operating system,"" he wrote. ""And unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum offered an easy-to-learn programming language, called Solidity, for anyone who wanted to build applications.""

Like any cryptocurrency, Ethereum exposure is not without inherent risk, with some analysts noting that the behavior of top traders at Huobi, Binance, and OKEx may suggest a ""lack of appetite for long positions."" However, other observers forecast the cryptocurrency's price pushing through to $2,700. Ether is still a relatively new digital currency, and its promise and applications across different industries may take time to unfold.

""Smart contracts on blockchain are real and they remind of the early days on the internet when people realized there was a network effect,” Cuban said, noting that it took 25 years from that early stage of development. ""We are right at that point right now where smart contracts on top of blockchain allow people to take anything that's digital and turn into a product and sell it.""","In brief Markets continue to tick up, with Bitcoin accelerating growth above $50,000.

Binance Coin becomes the world's third largest cryptocurrency.

Stock markets are down as traders look for individual companies to continue gains.

It was another good day for crypto investors, but some had better days than others. Bitcoin ticked up less than 1% as it continues to hold onto gains it made this week. But at the time of publishing, the project has been gaining aggressively and now sits above $52,000

Ethereum set new records yesterday, nudging into the $1,900s and at the time of writing is still there. While DeFi has been the engine propelling the price of ETH ever higher, yesterday NVIDIA announced it was releasing a range of GPUs tailored specifically for Ethereum.

In the hours after the announcement, Ethereum’s price reached $1,945 before settling back down to the low $1,900s.

But the prize for ‘most improved’ in the last 24 hours goes to Binance Coin (BNB). The currency created by the exchange of the same name has been surging up the cryptocurrency market cap ranks. At the time of writing BNB has pushed out Tether as the world’s third largest cryptocurrency.

Why the surge? PancakeSwap. The decentralized exchange, which is built on top of Binance’s Smart Chain overtook Uniswap as the world’s largest decentralized exchange by trading volume yesterday.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter to announce the news, and the project’s gains against Bitcoin.

#BNB not only made ATHs in fiat terms, it just reached ATH again #BTC. From a humble 0.00001 BTC per BNB, we have grown 480x against BTC in the last 3 and half years. Many thanks to our community, team, and @BinanceAngels. 🙏🙏🙏 pic.twitter.com/P5oJrNus6J — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) February 19, 2021

“From a humble 0.00001 BTC per BNB, we have grown 480x against BTC in the last 3 and half years,” said Zhao.

The gains for PancakeSwap appear to have come at the expense of other DeFi projects. Uniswap saw a 3% drop in its token price overnight, AAVE is down 8% and Synthetix, which up until only last week had been sat in the top 20 largest projects by market cap, has slid to 31 thanks to back to back losses.

Lastly, Dogecoin the project at the mercy of Elon Musk’s Twitter account, saw 10% gains in the last day, as the project recovers from its most recent hype cycle. Never a dull moment eh?

US Markets Down As Eyes Turn to GameStop Robinhood Hearing

The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed yesterday down after a week of gains, but some fared better than others. The S&P fell for a third straight day - racking up its biggest losing streak since December.

The reason? The overall performance and growth of the market has rotated out of the tech stocks that propelled the market boom last year and into mid and low cap projects that are seeing a return of customers and trading as COVID vaccinations gather pace.

""While performance breadth has increased, our work shows that the dispersion of individual stock returns has been on the rise and the direction and movement among S&P 500 stocks have become more independent,"" BMO Capital Markets strategist Brian Belski wrote in a note Thursday.

While that’s happening, Robinhood, the company that has helped onboard millions of retail investors into stock markets was raked over the coals for its involvement in the GameStop Short squeeze that took place last month.

Senators oscillated between highlighting the project’s customer service issues and tense exchanges between Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenez and Citadel’s Ken Griffin for their long, and often meandering answers.

Who said stock trading couldn’t be as exhilarating as crypto eh?",
2021-02-20,"Earlier this week, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, hit a milestone. It handily topped the psychological $50,000 level. As I write this on Feb. 17, it's closing in on a market value of $1 trillion (about $25 billion away).

Bitcoin has gotten an extra bump in recent weeks from a handful of brand-name companies adding it to their balance sheets or accepting it as a form of payment. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin to add to its balance sheet, with enterprise software company MicroStrategy buying in excess of $1.1 billion worth of tokens in December.

Even The Motley Fool has decided to purchase $5 million worth of Bitcoin to add to its balance sheet.

But at The Motley Fool, we strongly believe in understanding both sides to every investment. Personally, I don't think highly of Bitcoin. I have 10 reasons why I'll never buy it for my portfolio.

1. Its scarcity is a myth

Bitcoin optimists often cite its 21 million token limit. With 18.6 million Bitcoin already in circulation, it'll take close to 120 more years before the remaining 2.4 million are mined and put into circulation. The argument is that Bitcoin's fixed token count will help fight against the ongoing devaluation of the U.S. dollar as the money supply expands.

The flaw in this thesis is that Bitcoin's scarcity is nothing more than an illusion. While unlikely, community consensus could decide, at some point in the future, to increase Bitcoin's token count. Without any physical scarcity to speak of, a promise is all that keeps its token count from rising.

2. Its real-world utility is minimal

Though companies like Tesla are adding fuel to the Bitcoin craze, the reality is that it's not exactly a preferred form of payment. An analysis from business funding company Fundera found that approximately 2,300 U.S. businesses accept Bitcoin. There are more than 30 million businesses in the U.S., including sole-proprietorships, and about 7.7 million that employ at least one other person. After a decade, Bitcoin has hardly made a dent on the utility front.

Also, don't forget that a vast majority of tokens aren't actually in circulation. Investors are holding on to them, which further limits Bitcoin's ability to be a medium of exchange.

3. The barrier to entry is almost nonexistent

Want to start your own digital token? If you've got money and time on your hands, you can create your own digital currency with tethered blockchain. The barrier to entry in the crypto space is exceptionally low, meaning there could be dozens of superior alternatives to Bitcoin or its blockchain in development or available for use. Having virtually no barrier to entry suggests that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage isn't a selling point.

4. It's difficult to short-sell, which leads to inefficient markets

In recent weeks, retail investors (who also happen to be the core fans of Bitcoin) have been in an all-out war with short-sellers -- i.e., investors who profit when the price of a security falls. Some even view short-sellers as evil. But short-selling is a natural part of the investing cycle that helps lead to price discovery.

Bitcoin is really difficult to short-sell on most platforms, which means we're not getting anywhere near a true price discovery. This market inefficiency is one of the reasons Bitcoin is so exceptionally volatile.

5. It isn't even the best option among financial networks

Bitcoin's network has been touted as a game changer for financial payments. Rather than using traditional banking networks and waiting up to one week for payment to be validated and settled, Bitcoin can do so in an average of 10 minutes.

However, Bitcoin's usage is strictly limited to the payments side of the equation, and it's not even the best network at what it does in the financial space. Stellar (CRYPTO:XLM) can settle validate and settle financial transactions in mere seconds with its Lumens coin. Meanwhile, Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) provides nonfinancial blockchain applications with the addition of smart contracts -- commands that are executable once all predetermined conditions are met. Once again, Bitcoin may have first-mover advantage, but it's not the most innovative or functional kid on the block by a long shot.

6. Blockchain has been an enterprise bust thus far

Don't overlook that the Bitcoin story is really about advancing its underlying digital ledger, known as blockchain. With blockchain, transactions can be validated and stored forever in a transparent and immutable way.

While there are plenty of applications for blockchain on paper, we haven't seen these ideas translate into real-world functionality. Businesses have been unwilling to replace their proven network infrastructure with untested blockchain technology, creating something of a Catch-22. CoinDesk reported that tech stalwart IBM (NYSE:IBM) practically dismantled its blockchain division, according to four people familiar with the matter.

In short, enterprise blockchain has been a gigantic flop thus far.

7. Storage and security issues are worrisome

This is a bit more personal, but I have no desire to deal with the complexities of storing and protecting Bitcoin from hackers. Bitcoin must be stored in a digital wallet kept on a hardware-based platform or on the web. Either way, it can be far less secure than most folks realize.

An estimated $1.36 billion worth of crypto tokens, including at least 46,000 Bitcoins, were stolen in the first five months of 2020, according to CipherTrace. You'll get absolutely no protection from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, either.

8. The tax situation can be burdensome

If you think you hate doing your taxes now, try getting involved with Bitcoin. Since the Internal Revenue Service views cryptocurrency as property, all dispositions must be accounted for via capital gains and losses. You'll have to report more than just buying and selling Bitcoin. If you purchase Bitcoin and sell it to buy another cryptocurrency or a good/service, you'll have to report your cost basis and disposition price. It sounds burdensome, especially if you're using Bitcoin to buy goods and services.

9. It's driven purely by emotions and technical analysis

There are only two true drivers to Bitcoin's value: investor emotions and technical analysis (i.e., pretty charts). Neither of these is a particularly intriguing reason to buy in, especially since neither will help over the long run.

Fear of missing out (FOMO) and cheerleading from the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk have fueled this record run higher in Bitcoin. As noted earlier, utility remains poor, scarcity is a myth, and the barrier to entry is virtually nonexistent. What we're seeing is day traders having a field day, and that's not something I want my money in.

10. History is undefeated

Finally, history is undefeated when it comes to next-big-thing investment bubbles bursting. You can look back more than a quarter of a century to the birth of the internet, business-to-business commerce, genomics, 3-D printing, marijuana, and even blockchain. No matter what the next great advancement was, the bubble eventually burst. These trends did eventually produce winners, but history suggests that parabolic moves in assets tied to next-big-thing trends aren't sustainable.

For these 10 reasons, I don't plan to invest in Bitcoin.","The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 is among the list of bills to be presented in this Parliament session. While its contents are unknown, it touches upon two things:

1. Initiating laws to make it easier for RBI to create its own CBDC (central bank digital currency)

2. Banning 'private crypto assets' with some exceptions

We laud the government's intent towards creating a CBDC. Several central banks around the world have been working on CBDC, and India can't be sitting on the sidelines while other countries experiment and launch their own digital currency. CBDC will reduce the cost of providing financial services and lead to greater innovations that will empower faster business operations globally.

Also Read: What is Cryptocurrency Bill 2021; how it will impact bitcoin investors

However, the second part, which mentions banning 'private crypto assets' is concerning. It's an incorrect term fuelled with misconceptions about crypto. Bitcoin, Ether, etc. are public crypto assets built on public blockchains and have their own specific use cases.

It's also a misconception that CBDCs will render other crypto assets useless. They are digitised rupee, whereas crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own use cases. People use Bitcoin as a store of value, and Ethereum's smart contracts to create decentralised applications (DApps). While CBDC would be helpful, it solves completely different problems compared to what existing crypto assets solve. Every blockchain needs its own native token to operate to maintain the sanctity of the ecosystem.

Look at the crypto ecosystem as the internet and each crypto asset as a website. The government having its own website does not mean citizens and businesses cannot create their own websites as well.

Crypto is the financial internet of the future, and global decentralised apps would be built on blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Over 1 crore Indians are already saving, earning, and investing in this thriving global crypto economy. Banning it would be like banning the Internet in 1990s which will set India back by years while the rest of the world moves forward.

Next Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube will be built on decentralised platforms like Ethereum. To use it, Indians will have to pay in Ether. But more importantly, the next Facebook or WhatsApp could be built by an Indian startup on Ethereum. India's technological talent has the potential to accomplish this. But such a ban could hamper the formation and growth of the next billion-dollar company out of India.

We are all well aware of the devastating impact that COVID-19 has had on the Indian economy. Despite this, crypto has been generating jobs across a variety of functions in India and abroad. As of today, over 300 startups are generating tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and taxes. A blanket ban will not only adversely affect investors, but also honest businesses, the employment of thousands of people, and the economy.

Before passing any ban in haste, the government should also take a cue from developed countries like the US, UK, Switzerland, Japan, and New Zealand, etc. which are trying to regulate crypto assets. We have examples of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issuing a letter allowing US banks to interact with crypto, CTFC classifying Bitcoin and Ether as commodities, Germany allowing banks to buy/sell crypto, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) talking about regulation of Global Stablecoin (GSC), and many more.

Regulatory clarity has also prompted top global fintech giants and institutions like pension funds, unions, and endowments, etc. to hedge their investments with Bitcoin. For instance, Tesla has recently bought $1.5 Billion worth of Bitcoin, Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy has bought over $425 million worth of Bitcoin, PayPal allows all of its around 350 million users access to buy crypto assets on its platform, MasterCard has announced bringing crypto onto its network, Square has invested $50 million in Bitcoin, and many more. In comparison, India has lesser institutional participation, and regulatory uncertainty is to be blamed for this. A blanket ban will further deprive Indian companies of participating in this technological revolution.

Industry participants understand the ground realities of crypto and welcome positive regulations. But a blanket ban is something that will harm the entire country's financial and technology ecosystem.

That being said, positive regulations will give crypto adoption a big boost in India, leading to more job creation and increase in the tax revenue for the government. It will also foster innovation and fight crime at the same time. The government should take notice and hold discussions with the crypto industry of India before moving ahead with regulations for this sector.","FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during a conversation with legendary game designer Todd Howard (not pictured) at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2019.

(Reuters) - Billionaire CEO Elon Musk said on Saturday the price of bitcoin and ethereum seemed high, at a time when the cryptocurrencies have hit record highs, with bitcoin crossing the $1 trillion market-capitalization threshold.

The chief executive of Tesla Inc, whose recent tweets have fueled the digital-currency rally, made the remark on Twitter while replying to a user who said that gold was better than both bitcoin and conventional cash.

Musk, who earlier in the week remarked that he found the prospect of holding bitcoin adventurous for an S&P 500 company, said in a tweet: “Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter ...”

“That said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol,” he added.

Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, hit a fresh high in Asian trading on Saturday, extending a two-month rally a day after the digital currency’s market capitalization exceeded $1 trillion.

Ethereum or ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and daily volume.

Musk, an ardent proponent of digital currencies, has defended Tesla’s recent purchase of $1.5 billion of bitcoin, which has ignited mainstream interest in the digital currency.","Elon Musk admitted that bitcoin and ethereum ""seem high"" in Twitter exchange with Peter Schiff.

Elon Musk isn't one to shy away from speaking his mind on Twitter.

In his latest social media comments, the Tesla chief admitted the price of bitcoin and ethereum ""seem high"" as the crypto assets hit record highs.

Last night, bitcoin smashed through the $55,000 level, bringing the crypto's market cap to more than $1 trillion. Its latest rally has largely been attributed to Tesla's $1.5 billion purchase revealed in an SEC filing on Feb 8, sending Bitcoin up 16% on the day.

Musk's comment was in reply to Peter Schiff, a well-known crypto skeptic and 'gold bug,' who claimed that gold was a better asset allocation than bitcoin or fiat currency.

Schiff's was quoting Musk's tweet that bitcoin was a ""less dumb"" version of cash.

""When fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn't look elsewhere,"" Musk tweeted on February 19. ""Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is 'almost.'""

But Musk responded to the veteran stockbroker claiming that: ""An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto. Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.""

An hour later, the Musk followed up with a post saying: ""that said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol.""

Bitcoin is now trading 55,563.02, according to exchange site Coinbase. Ethereum has gained 174.20% year-to-date, now trading at $2001.77.","A prominent trader who built his following after accurately nailing Bitcoin’s collapse to $4,000 in March 2020 says that Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) are primed to outshine Bitcoin in the coming months.

In a new tweet, the analyst known in the industry as Capo says that while BTC is grabbing headlines, his money is in Ethereum.

“Here is my bet: ETH will outperform BTC this year. By far. ETH is my second biggest bag. That’s enough bet.”

According to the crypto strategist, Ethereum is positioning to print gains of over 194% against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) from its current value of 0.034.

“ETH/BTC 0.10 is written.”

Capo takes his analysis further by showing how ETH has been in a strong and steady uptrend against Bitcoin in the last 16 months.

“I see many jokes about ETH. The truth is that it has been trending up against BTC since September 2019 and each impulse is stronger than the last…”

Capo is also long-term bullish on Binance Coin against Bitcoin (BNB/BTC). Although he expects the pair to correct in the short term, he sees BNB/BTC building support above 0.0025 before surging to 0.02 by the end of the year.

“BNB/BTC.”

In addition, Capo is keeping a close watch on four crypto assets that he expects to erupt this bull cycle. He believes Chainlink (LINK) has the potential to increase over 194% after it held support of $15.

The trader adds that it is “inevitable” for Syntropy (NOIA) to hit $2, the Sandbox (SAND) to soar to $1, and Litentry to surge to $30.

Featured Image: Shutterstock/sdecoret","Bitcoin soared past $50,000 per coin for the first time on Tuesday, and three days later its market cap surpassed $1 trillion. To say the cryptocurrency and altcoins have been on a tear is an understatement — especially after Tesla (TSLA) bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin earlier this month. And as the prices of these digital assets increase, so does the temptation to heist cryptocurrency.

The Justice Department unsealed an indictment Wednesday alleging North Korean military hackers schemed to steal money and cryptocurrency around the world as part of a larger plot involving Sony Pictures. That indictment spurred a warning from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security: Hackers are upping their games to steal cryptocurrency.

But it’s not just nation states stealing digital wallets worth millions. Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting individuals and businesses to surreptitiously mine cryptocurrency using unsuspecting victims’ computer systems in a cyberattack called cryptojacking.

[Read more: Tesla's big bitcoin bet could come back to bite the EV maker]

“We've certainly seen in the past, a pretty reasonably good correlation between the price of bitcoin and the amount of cryptojacking activity,” Chester Wisniewski, principal research scientist at cybersecurity firm Sophos, told Yahoo Finance.

Experts say there are ways to reduce vulnerability to attacks by following basic and more sophisticated cybersecurity measures, starting with secure passwords.

International cybercriminals are stealing millions

North Korea and Iran, which are subject to U.S. sanctions, have leaned on cyberattacks against digital wallets to grow their coffers.

“North Korea's operative, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets and cryptocurrency instead of stacks of cash, have become the world's leading bank robbers,” federal prosecutor John Demers told reporters this week after the indictment was unsealed.

Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers speaks during a virtual news conference at the Department of Justice in Washington, U.S., October 28, 2020. He announced the unsealed indictment against the North Korean hackers on Feb. 17, 2021. Sarah Silbiger/Pool via REUTERS

Prosecutors allege hackers working for North Korea’s government targeted cryptocurrency companies and stole tens of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency, including $11.8 million from a financial services company in New York in 2020. The hackers used malware called CryptoNeuro Trader as a backdoor into victims’ computers, stealing $24 million from an Indonesian cryptocurrency company in 2018, and $75 million from a Slovenian cryptocurrency company in 2017, according to the indictment.

Story continues

The malware provided a back door to steal private keys, the indictment said. The illegitimate software was marketed under names including Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, iCryptoFx, Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale.

“It appears that this malware is very sophisticated, in the sense in that it is impersonating a legitimate piece of software...which is a powerful concept,” says Yehuda Lindell CEO & Co-founder of Unbound Tech, which provides cryptographic infrastructure, including key management and protection.

[Read more: What is dogecoin? Elon Musk has sent the meme cryptocurrency soaring]

While crypto asset holders may avoid clicking on an unfamiliar link, Lindell said, they might be more inclined to install an update that appears to come from a trading platform.

“Once you have malware, that has access to whatever keys you have done, then obviously that malware can go ahead and do whatever it wants and steal your funds,” Lindell said. ”If somebody manages to steal your funds, there's actually no way of getting them back, at all.”

Another problem is that not all cryptocurrency exchanges have the same security posture, compared to traditional banks, Lindell said. And when the incentive is so high, he said, the methods for theft become more sophisticated. “It’s direct money,” he said, unlike credit card number and password hacks that take added steps to convert to something of value.

According to a report from Amsterdam-based blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain cited by Coindesk, hackers and scammers are known to have stolen $7.6 billion in cryptocurrency between 2011 and late 2020.

Rise in “Cryptojacking” targeting consumers, businesses

Beyond direct attacks on crypto wallets, cybercriminals are increasingly launching cryptojacking attacks against consumers and businesses to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The criminals infiltrate and gobble up a target machines’ system resources, as a substitute for investing in their own computing power. Telltale signs of a cryptojacking attack can include sluggish performance and use of an unusually large amount of energy.

“Whenever you have something like this that is valuable, now all of a sudden more people are going to be willing to do things like...put little Trojan software and other things like this on people's computers to mine this cryptocurrency,” NYU Tandon School of Engineering processor Justin Cappos told Yahoo Finance.

[Read more: MicroStrategy CEO sees an 'avalanche' of companies buying bitcoin]

For the average user, cryptojacking could mean a slowdown in their computer’s performance, or an increase in their electricity bill as hackers force victims’ machines to operate at full throttle to mine cryptocurrencies as fast as possible. More sophisticated cybercriminals, however, will go after large businesses that rely on cloud platforms like Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS or Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure to mine cryptocurrencies, Cappos said.

A Bitcoin ATM sign is pictured in a bodega in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., February 9, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri

According to Wisniewski, cybercriminals install malware in businesses’ software running on AWS or Azure. The malware doesn’t touch AWS or Azure, but forces the business’s software to use a greater amount of computing resources from those services than they otherwise would to handle the intensive task of mining.

Such a dramatic increase in usage could add several thousand dollars to a company’s electric bill in a single month — and that high bill could be the only sign of an intrusion.

Protecting your digital wallet

To stave off an attack on a digital wallet or platform, Lindell advises individuals and entities to invest in professional security. Protecting cryptocurrency the same way as protecting your bank account, he said, “That's not going to cut it.”

Experts say the best way to think about the abstract concept of cryptocurrency funds, is to consider the funds and the account holder’s secret key as one and the same. How those keys are stored can vary, depending on how the assets are held.

Among three models, one is a custody model where an entity, such a cryptocurrency trading platform like Coinbase, holds and is responsible for protecting the key, and the asset holder uses a password to access funds associated with that key. A second model is one where the asset holder independently holds and is responsible for the key.

“Both of these models are dangerous for different reasons,” Lindell said.

A third model adopts a hybrid solution where two parties share the key, making it more difficult for hackers to infiltrate an account because no single point of attack could breach the key. Large institutions and major holders of cryptocurrencies also protect keys using “cold wallets” that store keys in physical vaults.

For consumers with an insignificant percentage of their assets held in cryptocurrency, the best bet may be to use secure passwords for email, messaging and other apps. Experts say it’s also critical to remain vigilant about opening email attachments, and steer clear of risky websites.

It doesn’t appear that the temptation to cryptojack or steal cryptocurrencies will go away anytime soon. On Friday, bitcoin was up 7.6% just after 4:30 p.m. ET, valued at nearly $56,000 a coin.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates is no longer a bitcoin bear. He has now taken a neutral stance on bitcoin as an investment. However, as an innovation, he says that cryptocurrency is one that the world would be better off without because it allows for certain criminal activities.

Bill Gates Changes His Mind About Bitcoin

Bill Gates spoke about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in two separate interviews Thursday. One was with CNBC where he was asked what he thinks about bitcoin “in the context of climate change seeing how bitcoin takes an enormous amount of energy to digitally mine.” Gates simply replied:

I don’t own bitcoin. I’m not short bitcoin. So, I’ve taken a neutral view.

“Bitcoin can go up and down just based on the mania or whatever the views are, and I don’t have a way of predicting how that will progress,” Gates continued.

The Microsoft founder added: “I do think moving money into a more digital form and getting transaction costs down, that’s something the Gates Foundation does in developing countries. But there, we do it so you can reverse the transactions so we have total visibility of who’s doing what. It’s not about tax avoidance or illegal activities.”

Gates has been no fan of bitcoin. In an interview with CNBC in 2018, he, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, and vice chairman Charlie Munger talked about bitcoin being worthless.

“As an asset class, you’re not producing anything and so you shouldn’t expect it to go up. It’s kind of a pure ‘greater fool theory’ type of investment,” Gates remarked. “I would short it if there was an easy way to do it.” BTC was trading at around $9,300 on that day. Since then, the price of the cryptocurrency has risen almost 511% to $56,805 at the time of writing.

Bill Gates Thinks the World Is Better Off Without Cryptocurrency Innovation

Another interview published Thursday where Gates talked about cryptocurrency was with The Wall Street Journal. Responding to the question, “What’s the one tech innovation the world would be better off without?” he said:

The way cryptocurrency works today allows for certain criminal activities. It’d be good to get rid of that.

However, Gates quickly added, “I probably should have said bioweapons. That’s a really bad thing. We shouldn’t have technology for that.”

According to Forbes’ real-time list of billionaires, Gates ranks fourth with a net worth of $124 billion. The first on the list is Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos with $189 billion in net worth, followed by Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk with $182 billion, and then Bernard Arnault with $159 billion.

Meanwhile, Microsoft has been granted a patent for a “cryptocurrency system using body activity data.” This crypto-mining system leverages human activities, including brain waves and body heat, when performing online tasks such as using search engines, chatbots, and reading ads.

As bitcoin continues its meteoric run, more investors are now reviewing the longstanding comparison between the famous cryptocurrency and gold.

Bitcoin crossed the $1 trillion market capitalization mark on Friday, while gold touched $1784.

Insider surveyed 10 experts to see which asset they'd rather hold for the next ten years-and why.

As bitcoin continues its meteoric rise, breaching new records and crossing the $1 trillion market capitalization mark in just the last week, more investors are assessing the longstanding comparison between the famous cryptocurrency and an equally well-known asset class: gold.

Both assets, experts say, are often seen as ways to diversify a portfolio or as a hedge against fiat currency inflation brought about by what some observers see as unsustainable fiscal and monetary policies.

Yet, until recently, it was rare to see Wall Street analysts, chief executives, or established investors seriously compare the two assets. Bitcoin, commonly referred to as digital gold, has historically been seen as a risky speculative investment for those looking to profit in the short term. Gold, meanwhile, has always been considered a safe-haven asset.

Now, bitcoin's rapid ascent to over $57,000 per coin, backed by new investments from Tesla and other institutional names, has led some to question whether old assumptions about these assets are correct.

Given digital currencies' dizzying climb, Insider surveyed 10 experts to see if they'd rather hold bitcoin or gold for the next 10 years, and why. We asked bitcoin bulls, gold lovers, analysts, executives, and more.

Here's what they had to say:

Holding Gold

""My vote would be for gold because it has thousands of years of a historical record as a store of value, has one-fifth the volatility of bitcoin, and doesn't face the same competition risk. The day that Queen Elizabeth trades in the five pounds of gold in her crown for crypto is the day I'll shift course."" - David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research, former Chief Economist and Strategist for Merrill Lynch Canada and Merrill Lynch in New York ""Gold and silver have been stores of value and mediums of exchange for at least 4 millennia in every civilization in every corner of the world. It has unmatched accessibility to people of all economic standing and technological knowledge. And gold is the ultimate currency of central banks, silver of the people. There is room for cryptocurrencies too since their digital nature is a fundamental difference from gold and silver. But that characteristic also ensures that cryptocurrencies will never replace gold and silver and will ultimately improve the metal's value."" - Phil Baker, President and CEO, Hecla Mining Company ""Gold has long been considered to be the safe-haven asset of choice, and, while bitcoin is 'the new kid on the block,' it's debatable that it will eat into gold's market share for a number of reasons. Bitcoin and gold both have significant advantages over fiat currencies because neither can be diluted or debased. There is a possibility that bitcoin could one day cease to exist through hostile legislation. Some bitcoin derivatives have already been banned. Companies such as Facebook who have attempted to start crypto have been prevented from doing so. So, while bitcoin is a more recent form of investment that is certainly receiving a lot of hype, gold has retained its value through centuries. Whether bitcoin will offer the same level of longevity is highly questionable."" - Sylvia Carrasco, CEO and founder of the gold exchange platform Goldex. ""One of the assumptions underlying bitcoin's bull case is its limited supply, but the supply of cryptocurrencies, on the whole, is theoretically unlimited. Some extol bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier, but it has so far exhibited higher correlations to equities than gold, particularly during periods of equity market stress when diversification tends to add the most value. The demand for bitcoin may be over its skis relative to its likelihood to carve out a significant economic or financial use case."" - Michael Reynolds, Investment Strategy Officer at Glenmede. ""Both crypto and gold have passionate investor bases… However, there are very clear differences. Gold's history as a basic building block of global money is 5,000 years old and time-tested; Bitcoin is 10 years old and has existed in only one monetary regime. The standard deviation of bitcoin's price is 75%, making it a horrible store of value. Recent price history shows a large bias toward speculative interest, so much so that companies are tempted to include bitcoin on corporate balance sheets to help grow assets in excess of corporate performance. Crypto is a poor monetary substitute. In the US, filing your taxes requires a voluntary disclosure of your cryptocurrency profits. If a crypto trade automatically generated a statement to the IRS as a brokerage transaction does, the speculative outlook could dim.""- Robert Minter, Director of Investment Strategy, Aberdeen Standard Investments

Bitcoin Bulls

""Bitcoin is a 100x improvement over gold as a store of value. The world is realizing this and beginning to reprice digital currency in real-time. Although bitcoin has increased hundreds of percent in the last few months, it is likely to continue appreciating in US dollar terms over the coming years. I suspect that bitcoin's market cap will surpass gold's market cap by 2030. For this reason, I own no gold and have a material percent of my net worth invested in bitcoin."" - Anthony Pompliano of Pomp Investments and Morgan Creek Digital Assets ""The crypto bull run has seized the attention of millions of people who previously had never considered digital currencies like Bitcoin to be an alternative asset. While gold and bitcoin are both sometimes used as a means to diversify and hold a range of valuable assets, in many ways they are quite different. Bitcoin and other digital currencies can be easily traded on platforms. We have seen progressive global firms offering to receive payment in bitcoin and advocates such as Tesla taking an active role in promoting it. This liquidity, ease of exchange, and wider use in the modern economy are some of the major differentiators. Gold has a relatively defensive purpose- to hold value, whereas Bitcoin and other currencies are intended to have several uses, not least ease of exchange, purchase, and liquidity."" - Pavel Matveev, CEO, Wirex. ""Based on the trajectory of this digital gold path and use cases globally, we believe bitcoin will be a mainstream asset class in the future. While gold has clear value and safety, the upside in bitcoin is eye-popping if it stays on its current course over the next decade."" - Daniel Ives Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst at Wedbush Securities ""Gold is, no pun intended, the standard if you want to measure purchasing power over millennia. The liquidity of gold has been consistent over time. Gold is what defines the X-axis of purchasing power over time. Bitcoin, while it shares defensive qualities with gold, has the additional attribute of being aspirational. What bitcoin would seem to possess is the potential to go up to multiples of a moonshot. No one thinks gold will moonshot. Bitcoin is also finite, unlike gold. No increase in demand can change that. There is zero elasticity."" - JP Thierot, CEO of Uphold, a digital money platform ""I would probably pick bitcoin but why not both? Gold and bitcoin have a very similar aspect to the portfolio. I would add gold as a diversifier. I would add bitcoin as a diversifier. The hedge is diversification. Bitcoin is a tool to get there. Bitcoin is a hedge to losing money to something stable."" - Mike Venuto, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, a $1 billion ETF.",
2021-02-21,"In 2014, Elon Musk – then a mere billionaire rather than the world’s richest man – opined that “bitcoin is probably a good thing.” Seven years on and he has made one of the biggest crypto investments in history, plunging $1.5 billion into the world’s hottest digital asset. By adding bitcoin to its balance sheet, electric car maker Tesla confirmed a new dawn for the crypto industry and reflected a trend of rising institutional interest that has propelled BTC to a new all-time high.

Of course, Tesla’s purchase, as well as its plans to accept the cryptocurrency as payment for products, did not happen in a vacuum. The carmaker is merely the best-known company to throw its financial heft behind the skyrocketing asset, with others having lain out the blueprint.

The year crypto went institutional

In November, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz called bitcoin “an institutional asset,” predicting that 2021 will be “as good or better than 2020.” Given that bitcoin has subsequently soared to unprecedented highs while attracting investment from the likes of Tesla, that prophecy might as well be engraved on a tablet of stone. A month after Novogratz’ tweet, British asset manager Ruffer confirmed that it had bought $744 million of bitcoin, constituting 2.7% of its assets under management.

The timing proved propitious: within two months, the company had withdrawn its initial outlay – plus $650 million of profits. “We still have around $700 million left in and are currently up by $750 million overall,” said Ruffer co-manager Duncan MacInnes in early February.

Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy, headed up by vocal bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, was another big firm to FOMO into crypto last year, taking its BTC holdings to $1.1 billion (now worth over $3 billion). Saylor calls bitcoin “an institutional safe-haven asset,” and claims that it can convert a balance sheet from a liability into an asset. No-one applauded Tesla’s purchase more enthusiastically than Saylor, who previously offered to show Musk his “playbook” on Twitter. Billionaires stick together, you know.

The MicroStrategy boss recently hosted a Corporate Strategy conference, where he talked about ways to preserve capital, generate income, and create shareholder value using bitcoin. During the event, New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) CEO Ross Stevens revealed that the firm managed $6 billion in bitcoin for some 280 institutional clients.

Many are wondering what has driven such enormous institutional flows.

Why now? Certainly, the growing recognition of bitcoin as an asset class has helped, as has the eye-watering Covid-19 stimulus packages announced by a slew of central banks, which have strengthened bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative: the hardest of all hard currencies, bitcoin has a fixed, predictable supply of 21 million. Low-interest rates are also motivating individuals and institutions to explore deflationary, non-sovereign assets.

According to a leaked Citibank report, arguments in favour of bitcoin “could well be at their most persuasive ever,” particularly since banks are increasingly exploring their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The report’s author, analyst Tom Fitzpatrick, claimed bitcoin could achieve a price of $318,000 in 2021. While that seems especially optimistic, Fitzpatrick isn’t exactly an outlier: in a recent research note to clients, analysts at JPMorgan Chase predicted a long-term price target of more than $146,000. There is, in other words, plenty of race left to run.

Growing familiarity, positive forecasts

A decade after bitcoin first reached parity with the US dollar, people are losing their fear factor. Retail interest has grown steadily in the western world, and at this juncture, most people are, at the very least, aware of bitcoin and understand its value. If you don’t hold any, chances are you know someone that does.

A recent survey by bitFlyer USA, the North American arm of Japan’s most popular cryptocurrency exchange, highlighted this point. According to a survey of 3,000 participants, “30% of Americans believe bitcoin/cryptocurrencies will be an attractive investment in 2021, making it two times more popular than gold and the fourth most selected asset.”

Despite lawmakers and mainstream media voices often portraying bitcoin as a preferred currency of criminals and fraudsters, 76% of US-based respondents who were familiar with cryptocurrency had a positive perception of it as an investment.

“This survey highlights a few key points,” says bitFlyer USA COO Joel Edgerton. “One is the global nature of bitcoin and the clash of different viewpoints (Japanese and American) using the exact same information. Japanese retail clients have been in the market longer than American retail customers and are a bit more cynical during this bull market cycle. Another is the beginning of bitcoin moving beyond the story of a digital commodity replacing gold and into a new phase as a replacement for payment systems. Beyond Tesla buying bitcoin as a reserve for its cash, it also announced it would accept bitcoin as payment for its cars. In the long run, that second part is more bullish for the growth of bitcoin in the global financial system”.

“In its SEC filing, Tesla noted that it bought bitcoin to maximise returns on its idle cash reserves. This makes sense whatever way you look at it, and we expect this kind of pragmatic thinking to permeate the corporate world in coming months.”

Nimrod Lehavi, CEO and co-founder of global industry fiat/crypto leader, Simplex, sounds a similarly positive note. “The industry is in a great place primed for mass adoption. Even setting aside the recent rally, we’re at a juncture where users can acquire cryptocurrency at the touch of a button, convert it to fiat just as easily, helping individuals everywhere leverage their funds the way they want to, whether that’s in crypto or fiat.

“At Simplex, we’ve partnered with over 200 crypto exchanges, brokers, and wallets, in addition to leading browsers and tech companies to facilitate the capability for seamless on/offramps. We enable the complete issuance of crypto-to-fiat friendly banking solutions and bank cards, which can be used to transact in any stores that accept Visa cards. The increased fungibility of cryptocurrency strengthens its appeal, because, as well as being a store of wealth, it can act as a medium of exchange.”

Crypto for the common man

Because each bitcoin is divisible into 100 million satoshis, it’s not just big-brained billionaires who can build a portfolio. In October, PayPal announced that it would support the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies directly on its platform. The fintech company also said that digital assets would be enabled as a funding source for purchases, meaning users could make purchases in their preferred crypto at over 26 million merchants.

Although Musk recently announced that he would follow the lead of Hewlett Packard and move Tesla’s base of operations from Silicon Valley to Texas, there is a decidedly West Coast flavor to institutional bitcoin adoption. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, is based in San Francisco, and Twitter’s finance chief Ned Segal has said the tech giant is looking at whether it can use bitcoin to pay vendors and employees. Facebook, of course, is still working on its own digital currency. Formerly known as Libra, the proposed stablecoin hit the skids amid regulatory scrutiny in 2019 and was rebranded Diem late last year. It’s expected to launch sometime this year.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, of course, has long been a proponent of bitcoin; his company Square acts as one of the United States’ most popular fiat onramps via Cash App, which now has over 30 million active monthly users. Last year, Square announced that it had purchased $50 million of bitcoin, calling it “an instrument of economic empowerment” and “a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system.”

Dorsey has also teamed up with rapper Jay Z to create a bitcoin-backed endowment to fund development in Africa and India.

Given the influence of Musk and Dorsey – combined, they have over 50 million Twitter followers – it seems likely that we’ll see lots of fast-moving Silicon Valley entrepreneurs race to add bitcoin to their balance sheets over the next 12 months. After all, when some of the world’s best-known investors are stacking sats, it’s only logical to follow suit. Particularly if you too have deep pockets.

Hedge funds, carmakers, tech giants, banks – all are pushing demand for cryptocurrency to fresh highs, while beneath the ivory towers, regular consumers load up on crypto.","In this article TSLA

Tesla has made roughly $1 billion in paper profits from its investment into bitcoin, according to Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. The company is ""on a trajectory to make more from its Bitcoin investments than profits from selling its EV (electric vehicle) cars in all of 2020,"" Ives estimated in a note published Saturday. Earlier this month, the U.S. electric carmaker disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin for ""more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash.""

The purchase was made some time in January, the company said without disclosing when or at what price it bought bitcoin for. It's unclear if Tesla has sold any of the bitcoin yet.

Bitcoin's record-breaking rally to a $1 trillion market capitalization on Friday has increased the buzz around cryptocurrencies. Debates on whether these are worthy investments have flourished among investors, analysts, and the public.

Despite critics arguing against the legitimacy of these assets, a new study reveals that cryptocurrencies are viewed as safe investments by 50% of Americans. Additionally, 41% of those surveyed said investing in the stock market and cryptocurrencies are equally risky investments.

Conducted by Piplsay, a global consumer research platform, the study surveyed over 30,000 people in February on their views on digital currencies.""The crypto bull run has seized the attention of millions of people who previously had never considered digital currencies like Bitcoin to be an alternative asset,"" said Pavel Matveev, CEO of Wirex, a digital payments platform. ""Bitcoin and other currencies are intended to have several uses, not least ease of exchange, purchase, and liquidity.""

The survey also revealed that 57% of Americans think major companies should start accepting cryptocurrencies as payments. In a separate survey of 1,050 Americans conducted by DealAid, 50% of investors said they would be willing to pay for products using bitcoin.

Some companies this year have already taken steps towards accepting cryptocurrency as a means of payment. PayPal in October 2020 said it will start allowing people to use cryptocurrencies starting this year, while Tesla announced in January it plans to start accepting bitcoin as payment . Investment banks JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have both also expressed interest in considering cryptocurrency as payment.

Critics however are quick to argue that the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them poor medium of exchange.

""If you bought a $50,000 Tesla with four bitcoins on October 1st, that purchase now has an opportunity cost of $212,000, because bitcoin's dollar price has risen from $10,000 to $53,000 in those four and a half months,"" said Robert Minter, Director of Investment Strategy, Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""That type of volatility is unsuitable for transacting in an economy."" Bitcoin has skyrocketed in recent days, surging 60% this month alone. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, also soared to record highs Thursday . Even dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that began as a joke, has been gaining traction in recent weeks

""Bitcoin's market cap hitting $1 trillion demonstrates the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency as a store of value,"" said Adam Liposky, Ecosystem Operations Lead at Pocket Network, a blockchain data ecosystem for Web3 applications. ""We expect that Bitcoin is only the first of many $1TR market caps that we'll see in the blockchain economy.""

Enthusiasts argue bitcoin may exist solely as a form of value akin to ""digital gold,"" while other forms of digital currencies will emerge as forms of payment.

Mike Venuto told Insider he doubts ""we will ever buy coffee with bitcoin.""

""This excitement obscures the reality of the original bitcoin thesis of decentralization, replacing the trusted third party and banking the unbanked,"" Venuto, who manages an approximately $1 billion ETF, said. ""The focus now seems to be the store of value argument from the limited supply.""","Opinion / Columnists DESNÉ MASIE: Beware thorns while picking low-hanging bitcoin fruit in crypto spring Pouring the house money into speculative alternative investments such as these is not advisable BL PREMIUM

I’m not here to tell you not to buy bitcoin, nor am I here to tell you to buy bitcoin. What I will tell you is that, believer or not, bitcoin is quite obviously here to stay, so it’s worth taking the time at least to understand how it fits into global capital markets.

I was ridiculed by some colleagues in 2018 by continuing to insist we should advise our financial services clients on bitcoin and other crypto-assets even after the dramatic price drop over that year, in which bitcoin lost 80% of its value. And lo, one of our former investment bank clients, a huge US bank, announced last week it was moving firmly into custody of digital assets...","Piplsay research reveals that 27% of US consumers are planning to make investments in cryptocurrency during 2021. Around 50% of Americans think that it’s now “safe” to invest in decentralized digital currencies, the survey revealed.

About 57% of US-based consumers said they think major brands should begin taking crypto payments, according to the survey results.

Bitcoin has been on a tear lately, sending almost everyone from traditional companies to individual investors “scurrying for a slice of the crypto pie,” Piplsay researchers noted. The Bitcoin craze has become so wild that even US government officials are showing their strong support for this movement in the most unexpected or surprising ways.

Piplsay also mentioned that their new report looks into the growing public interest and understanding of this nascent asset class and concept of transacting in digital currency. Crypto wallet providers may want to consider leveraging this data in their decision-making, the company suggests.

Elon Musk’s Tesla has managed to create quite the buzz recently when it acquired $1.5 billion of Bitcoin while confirming it would accept it as a form of payment in the foreseeable future. Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has also been commenting frequently (mostly jokes) on Dogecoin, a meme-inspired crypto.

Musk’s comments have led to a dramatic increase in the Dogecoin (DOGE) price. From being seen only as mostly a speculative investment to becoming a legitimate payment method for online purchases, cryptocurrency appears to be finally gaining mainstream acceptance. This can be seen by “all the renewed interest and discussions,” Piplsay confirmed.

The researchers also questioned that amid all this buzz, what do US consumers think about the concept of virtual currencies? Piplsay reports that it surveyed 30,330 individuals nationwide to obtain some insights.

Some of the notable findings shared by the researchers are as follows:

38% Millennials say they understand cryptocurrency “as compared to 33% of Gen Xers and 29% of Gen Zers”;

42% of Millennials “think cryptocurrency is safe as compared to 34% of Gen Xers and 24% of Gen Zers”;

About 32% of Millennials and Gen Zers each and 29% of Gen Xers “plan to invest in cryptocurrency this year’;

Survey Methodology

This Piplsay survey (powered by Market Cube) was performed nationwide in the United States from February 15-16, 2021. The company reportedly received 30,330 online responses from people who were at least 18 years old.

Piplsay research reports “reflect independent opinions of respondents and are not sponsored by any organization or individual,” the company claims. The survey questionnaires are “based on key consumer trends.”

(Note: you may check out the detailed survey results here.)","The current Bitcoin (BTC) bull market has been fueling another major boom in blockchain or distributed ledger tech (DLT) startup deals.

Coinbase Ventures had launched back in 2018, which was during the extended cryptocurrency bear market that lasted from early January of that year to well into 2019. After the BTC price had surged to nearly $20,000 in December 2017 from only around $1,000 in January 2017, the flagship cryptocurrency crashed to a low of below $4,000 in December 2018.

As a digital asset trading platform, that short-lived momentum was actually good for Coinbase’s business (in the long-term). However, the decision to establish a cryptocurrency-focused VC company had less to do with the BTC price than what the market fervor had meant for innovators.

Shan Aggarwal from Coinbase noted that the company “recognized in early 2018 that there were a ton of new startups that were leveraging blockchain technology.”

Coinbase Ventures thought that they would be able to take advantage of the long run by investing in the crypto and blockchain space, Aggarwal revealed. And soon, the digital assets company would become one of the sector’s most active investors, with major deals supporting CryptoKitties developers, stablecoin creator Terra and digital currency exchange Bitso.

Coinbase Ventures has been a key part of a transformative movement that has been repeating itself in certain ways ever since the first Bitcoins were mined around 12 years ago. Whenever the BTC price reaches new all-time highs, companies naturally start increasing their investments.

Blockchain or crypto startup deals also usually gain a lot of momentum after the Bitcoin starts rising.

But after the Bitcoin mania had subsided in early 2018, venture capital investors had still been allocating funds into crypto and DLT firms or initiatives. In 2018, these types of funding activities totaled $2.8 billion across almost 400 different deals (the highest funding amount on record, according to Pitchbook data). A similar development has followed a relatively smaller BTC price increase during mid-2019.

Andreessen Horowitz‘s Chris Dixon has said that this type of activity may be described as the “crypto price-innovation cycle.” It works or starts when Bitcoin and other digital currencies appreciate in value, “sensational” news reports and media coverage follows, business owners and developers take a lot more interest, and then VCs step in to make investments in these projects.

During the last month, Bitcoin has managed to surge dramatically and it’s currently trading at well over $56,000 at the time of writing. But the key question now is how long will this rally last and what major impact might we see on startups. Most investors are probably hoping that history will repeat itself.

Paul Veradittakit from Pantera Capital has predicted that we’re going to see “a lot of entrepreneurs coming into the space.”

Momentum keeps on building in the crypto space at an unprecedented rate. The dramatic surge in Bitcoin has also coincided with the best-performing quarter for crypto and DLT startups since the end of 2018, totaling $702 million during Q4 2020, PitchBook data confirmed.

Since October of last year, the BTC price has more than tripled, from below $11,000 to over $57,000 (before correcting very slightly).

Because many of the products of DLT startups are intimately or closely linked to the value of various virtual currencies, the rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum (recently surpassed the $2,000 mark) and other digital assets could improve the overall outlook for those startups even more, Veradittakit argued.

Traditional VC companies seem to be quite eager to increase their exposure to the blockchain ecosystem now. A16z introduced its second crypto-asset fund with $515 million during 2020. Union Square Ventures intends to allocate 30% of its recently finalized $251 million fund to cryptocurrency firms.

Prominent investors Polychain Capital, Pantera, Pithia and Blockchain Capital have each secured funds valued at over $100 million in order to make investments in blockchain and crypto startups (since 2018).

Public investors may soon have the option to get in on this action as well. Coinbase has announced plans for a direct listing, and competing exchange Bakkt is set to go public via a $2.1 billion SPAC merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings.

The unprecedented surge in the BTC price has been supported by increased interest among institutional clients and an overall wider access to the crypto-assets markets that was not possible before.

Retail investors are now able to purchase cryptocurrencies via Robinhood and PayPal, which has removed the requirement for consumers to maintain accounts via dedicated virtual currency exchanges.

The BTC price continues to set new all-time highs, which has led to some analysts comparing the market to the Tulip Mania of the 1600s. However, these arguments no longer have much of a foundation because major players like Elon Musk’s Tesla have now acquired $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and will accept the crypto as payment.

Tesla joined the Bitcoin market after many prominent investors like MicroStrategy had allocated large amounts of funds to BTC investments.

Other well-known organizations that have also joined include the endowments of Harvard and Yale, along with Square, which revealed in October 2020 that it had acquired $50 million in Bitcoin (which is now worth over $250 million).

Aggarwal from Coinbase added:

“The infrastructure that existed [in 2018] was really, really nascent. There’s been tremendous progress in developing core infrastructure for crypto.”

Those improvements have led to much more scalable, economical and faster digital asset transactions.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is another major emerging sector that has managed to gain many new users and investors. These individuals and organizations are aggressively betting that traditional banking solutions may be securely offered via blockchain or DLT-based platforms.

Steve Jang from Kindred Ventures notes that DeFi was “a nascent, unsure thing a few years ago” but he argues that “now it’s much more established.”

BlockFi, a fast-growing digital assets platform, has become one of the most-funded startups in the crypto space after acquiring $50 million in capital in 2020 via a round led by Morgan Creek Digital Assets along with Valar Ventures, Winklevoss Capital and others.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or digital collectibles launched on blockchain platforms like Ethereum have also become quite popular during this historic bull market.

CryptoKitties developer Dapper Labs had also become really popular after the 2019 launch of NBA Top Shots, which is a game that uses NFTs to store tradeable video clips from basketball games—basically like trading digital cards.

The Ethereum-powered online game has seen users spend large amounts of money on purchasing memorable game highlights.","The Purpose Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund debuted on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Feb. 18 and has quickly ramped up trading volumes of about $400 million worth of shares in two days. This is quite impressive, considering that the equity market in Canada is only a fraction of the size of the U.S. markets. This shows strong demand for Bitcoin and investor's preference to take the ETF route to establish fresh positions.

Last week, Bitcoin reached another important milestone when it hit the critical $1 trillion market capitalization on Feb. 19, making it the sixth asset on the list of top market cap companies in the world.

The involvement of institutional investors and a market cap of over $1 trillion could allay the concerns of manipulation and liquidity raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the previous years as it rejected Bitcoin ETF applications.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said that “the probability of an ETF has gone up.” Wood said the new SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who taught a digital currency class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, could be more open to crypto, increasing the likelihood of an approved Bitcoin ETF.

Although Bitcoin’s fundamental factors continue to improve, the near term could experience some turbulence due to the steepening of the U.S. Treasury curve.

Let’s analyze the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that indicate the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend in the short term.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel on Feb. 19 and the bulls have managed to sustain the breakout. This suggests that traders continue to buy at higher levels.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The BTC/USD pair had formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Feb. 20, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. That uncertainty has resolved to the upside today and the bulls will now try to propel the price to $60,974.43.

The 20-day exponential moving average ($47,450) is sloping up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, which indicates that bulls have the upper hand.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price re-enters the channel, the bears will try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA. A break below the channel will indicate a possible change in trend and the pair may then correct to the 50-day simple moving average.

The 4-hour chart shows the pair remains in a strong uptrend and the bulls have aggressively purchased the dips to the 20-EMA. The bears will try to stall the current uptrend at the resistance line of the ascending channel.

If they succeed, the pair may again drop to the 20-EMA. A bounce off this support will suggest that the trend remains strong and the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy. The momentum could pick up if the bulls can propel and sustain the price above the channel.

On the contrary, if the bears can sink the price below the 20-EMA, it will suggest profit-booking by traders. The trend could weaken if the pair plunges below the channel.

AAVE/USD

AAVE has been consolidating between $392.50 and $545 for the past few days. A consolidation after a strong uptrend is a positive sign as it suggests that traders are not rushing to the exit because they anticipate higher levels in the future.

AAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($427) is flat and the RSI is just above 56, which suggests that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.

If the buyers can push the price above $480, the AAVE/USD pair may rise to $545. A breakout and close above the $545 to $581.667 resistance zone could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $697.50 and then $814.397.

On the other hand, if the bears can sink and sustain the price below $392.50, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could start a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($297).

The 4-hour chart shows that the price has been oscillating between $500 and $392.50. If the bears sink the price below the $392.50 support, the pair could drop to $300 and then to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $267.094.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above the 50-SMA, a move to $500 is possible. A break above this resistance will enhance the prospects of a move to $545 and then $581.667.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) is currently correcting in a strong uptrend. While the pullback is five days old, the bears have not yet been able to pull the price down to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $19.007. This shows a lack of sellers at lower levels.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A shallow correction is usually a sign of strength and it increases the possibility of a retest of the $26.55 overhead resistance. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand.

If the bulls can thrust the price above $26.55, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The ATOM/USD pair could then rally to $32.173. If the bulls can conquer this level, the up-move may extend to $40.

On the contrary, if the pair continues to fall, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($18.19) is possible. A strong bounce off this support could keep the uptrend intact but a break below it will suggest a deeper correction to the 61.8% retracement level at $14.347.

The 4-hour chart is currently correcting inside a descending channel. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating a minor advantage to the bears.

However, if the price rises from the support line of the descending channel, it will indicate accumulation at lower levels. On a break above the moving averages, a move to the resistance line of the channel is possible.

A breakout and close above the channel could result in a retest of $26.55. On the other hand, a break below the channel may weaken sentiment. The pair could then decline to the 50% retracement level at $16.677.

NEO/USD

NEO broke and closed above the $47.444 resistance on Feb. 19. The bears attempted to fake this breakout and trap the aggressive bulls on Feb. 20 when they pulled the price back below $47.444.

NEO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the bulls had other plans. They aggressively purchased the dip and have pushed the price above the psychological resistance at $50 today. This may start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $60.373 and then $64.95.

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that bulls are in control.

But if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $50, it will suggest that traders are booking profits at higher levels. A break below the 20-day EMA ($37.80) will signal a possible change in trend.

The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle, which has a pattern target at $58.588. Generally, the price turns down and retests the breakout level but sometimes, when the trend is strong, the price only consolidates before resuming the up-move.

The bulls are currently defending the $50 support. If the price rises from the current level and breaks above $54.191, the uptrend could resume.

This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down from the current level and breaks below the triangle. Such a move may result in a fall to $36.30.

VET/USD

After the sharp rally from $0.026714 to $0.060774, VeChain (VET) has largely held the 38.2% support at $0.047763 on a closing basis, which shows accumulation at lower levels. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.

VET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bulls can drive the price above the overhead resistance at $0.060774, the VET/USD pair could start the next leg of the up-move. The target level to watch on the upside is $0.085172 and then $0.10.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to propel the price above the overhead resistance, the VET/USD pair may consolidate between $0.060774 and $0.0424 for a few more days. The trend will tilt in favor of the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $0.0424.

The 4-hour chart shows that both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.

However, the pair has formed an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $0.060774. This bullish setup has a pattern target of $0.079148.

On the other hand, if the price slips below the trendline of the ascending triangle, it will invalidate the pattern and open the doors for a fall to $0.042.

The most popular cryptocurrency fell to $47,400, a one-week low. At one point, it lost nearly 17% of its value, or about $160 billion of its total market capitalization.

Bitcoin recouped some of the losses later in the trading session and was last down around 5.5% at $54,322, on track for its worst day since Jan 27. Its market cap was just under $1 trillion on Monday.

“Fairly standard after a rise this large to see a pullback. The usual dislocation of markets was seen,” said Charles Hayter, chief executive officer of crypto data provider CryptoCompare in London.

Traders also pointed to the unwinding of highly leveraged long positions in the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin, which rallied on Sunday to a peak of $58,354, was still up more than 80% this year. Since hitting a low in March below $4,000, bitcoin has surged nearly 1,200%.

Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk, whose tweets on bitcoin have added fuel to the cryptocurrency’s rally, said on Saturday the price of bitcoin and rival cryptocurrency ethereum seemed high.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also tamped down the flames on Monday, saying bitcoin is extremely inefficient at conducting transactions and is a highly speculative asset.

“The selloff across the board this week is a result of some of last week’s exuberance easing, as well as a much-needed unwinding of over-leveraged long positions,” said Ross Middleton, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange DeversiFi.

Ethereum, which tends to move in tandem with bitcoin, also tumbled after hitting a record high on Saturday. It hit a three-week low on Monday and was last down about 8.2% at $1,774.

Trading platform IG said on Monday it had reached its limit for the amount of cryptocurrency it holds as a business and that it was no longer accepting new cryptocurrency buy orders from clients.

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has been fuelled by signs that it is gaining acceptance among mainstream investors and companies, from Tesla and Mastercard Inc to BNY Mellon.

“We do tend to think that there’s a good chance of a down week and small correction coming in off of this, although it does little to dull medium-term prospects,” said Joseph Edwards of Enigma Securities, a cryptocurrency brokerage in London.

BNY Mellon is working with Fireblocks in conjunction with a new unit it announced earlier this month to help clients hold, transfer and issue digital assets, according to a report on Monday by CoinDesk.","Bitcoin soared on Tuesday to an all-time high reaching the $50,000 milestone at $50.602.

Bitcoin slid Monday, pausing its stunning rally after Elon Musk said prices ""seem high.""

The world's most valuable cryptocurrency sank over 10% to a price of $51,993 Monday morning, according to data from Coin Metrics. At one point, bitcoin had dipped below the $50,000 level, falling as low as $47,700.

It wasn't immediately clear what was behind bitcoin's move lower Monday. On Saturday, Tesla's CEO said the prices of bitcoin and rival token ether seemed excessive. Bitcoin rallied to more than $58,000 on Sunday, but has since reversed course.

As of 12:00 a.m. ET, bitcoin was trading over 8% lower at a price of $53,195. It's worth pointing out that price swings of more than 10% aren't a rarity in crypto. Bitcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% of its value the following year.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned bitcoin was a ""highly speculative asset"" and said she's worried about investors losing their money.

""It's an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that's consumed in processing those transactions is staggering,"" the former Federal Reserve chair said.

The digital coin is still up more than 80% so far this year. Last week, bitcoin hit $1 trillion in market value for the first time — it's now back below that mark, according to CoinDesk. The token has gotten a boost from news of major Wall Street Banks and Fortune 500 companies warming to cryptocurrencies.

Musk recently came out as a believer in bitcoin, calling it a ""good thing"" and saying he thinks it's ""on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people.""","Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, jumped above $58,200 on Monday as the total market cap of BTC touched $1.1 trillion. Despite the recent price jump, there is one thing to worry about BTC, and that is the liquidity of Bitcoin.

According to a note by JP Morgan’s strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the market liquidity in Bitcoin is significantly lower than S&P 500 and gold. He added that even a small change in Bitcoin flows can have a large impact on the price of BTC.

“Bitcoin has roughly tripled in the past three months but its liquidity has deteriorated. Market liquidity is currently much lower for Bitcoin than in gold or the S&P 500, which implies that even small flows can have a large price impact,” Panigirtzoglou added.

BTC started this year at a price level of $29,000, the cryptocurrency is up nearly 100% in the last 7 weeks. The price of Bitcoin received a major boost from institutional adoption. BTC’s volatility has increased significantly since the start of 2021 and an important reason behind that is its declining liquidity.

Bitcoin’s Limited Supply

The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million and large crypto whales are accumulating as much BTC as they can to create a supply shortage in the market. Finance Magnates earlier reported about the supply crisis of BTC at leading cryptocurrency exchanges around the world. The supply of the world’s largest crypto asset at digital exchanges reached its lowest level in more than 2 years this month. Cryptocurrency whales are moving large amounts from exchanges to cold storage or unknown wallets to create a shortage. More than $1 billion worth of Bitcoin left Coinbase in the last 24 hours.

“Bitcoin trading volumes are around $10 billion daily for the spot and futures market combined, compared with an equivalent figure of $100 billion for gold,” Panigirtzoglou mentioned in the note. BTC is currently trading near $55,000 with a market cap of $1.02 trillion.","BTC above $58k and ETH at $2,000 as the crypto rally moves to altcoins. CRO and RVN fly high with big gains. UNI faces swap competition.

ETH

Ethereum capitalized on the cryptocurrency rally to hit new highs above the $2,000 level. The price has since pulled back to the $1,780 area, but the coin is still above the previous highs near $1,600.

As was seen in the summer rally of 2020, Ethereum’s gains are being overshadowed by surging growth in the Decentralized Finance space (DeFI). The total value locked (TVL) in the sector is now $42 billion, having surged almost three times its value since the turn of the year. It was noted today that, “the aggregate value of the 100 largest tokens by market cap currently stands at $83 trillion”.

ETH is a benefactor of this rise in popularity as the majority of projects using blockchain technology for traditional finance practices are housed on the ether blockchain.

One obstacle to the growth of these projects and the sector has been the rise of Ethereum gas fees. The next development for ETH is the path to a V2.0 system that will migrate to a more scalable and less energy-intensive blockchain.

The recent surge in Ethereum and Bitcoin has seen Elon Musk talking the prices down for the first time. Musk was replying to the standard Twitter arguments about Bitcoin and gold when he said:

Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter… That said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol.

His comments will take the steam out of the recent Tesla-related surge after the carmaker announced it had purchased $1.5 billion in BTC. Musk’s comments would suggest that Tesla won’t be buying a larger stake at these levels, while they may convince other corporates to also back away from imminent purchases.

ETH may look to test the $1,600 level again as the crypto sector is surely due a technical correction after a serious run of gains.

UNI

Uniswap is one of the DeFi projects seeing big gains in its governance token. Uniswap has emerged as one of the top decentralized exchanges (DEX) that are leading the current bull run in crypto finance.

The last few months have seen the Uniswap team focused on developing version 3. Uniswap was one of the original liquidity providers to other projects and this gave the project a first-mover advantage in the market. The coin sees over $1-2 billion in daily volume and a high of $5.7 billion was registered in January. The Uniswap project is ranked at number 12 in the list of coins with a market cap of $9bn.

Uniswap is seeing swift competition from PancakeSwao and SushiSwap for DEX superiority and PancakeSwap (CAKE) took over the mantle as the world’s largest decentralized exchange recently with $1.7 billion traded versus Uniswap’s $1.6 billion.

The price of UNI surged to $32 last week from lows near $17 and the coin has easily surpassed the 2020 highs of $8.800. This is happening when mass adoption and usage of DeFi finance tools haven’t appeared. Once ETH completes the upgrade to lower gas fees, the price could continue higher for UNI.

CRO

Crypto.Com has seen its CRO coin surge 70% in the past 24 hours as the Bitcoin and Ethereum-led rally starts to expand outwards into smaller altcoins. With the prices of BTC and ETH continuing to hit new highs, investors are likely reinvesting profits to take advantage of lower valuations.

CRO has rallied 180% in total for the week and the provider of crypto visa cards has moved to number 16 in the list of coins by market cap. It has been a strong February for the coin, which traded near the $0.05 level at the start of the month and now trades at $0.25.

Crypto.com is benefitting from being a multi-product offering with its own exchange and the ability to obtain credit. The project also offers the ability to swap and farm DeFi coins in its own Swap Protocol. These multi-product offerings are starting to appeal to investors in light of the US dollar’s waning price and influence. Because of the gains that were seen in cryptocurrencies recently. Investors are less interested in cashing out on recent gains, with many preferring to earn interest or reinvest into other tokens.

RVN

Another strong altcoin was Ravencoin, which was 127% higher over the last seven days with the coin testing a break into the top 50 coins.

RVN has also seen a huge rise in February with similar price action to CRO. Ravencoin traded under $0.05 but has since surged above $0.25. RVN has not been able to hold those gains and has since pulled back by 17% to trade at $0.18.

Ravencoin markets itself as a “peer-to-peer blockchain, handling the efficient creation and transfer of assets”. The coin was created as a reference to the ravens of Westeros in the hit tv show, Game of Thrones. Ravencoin is said to be, “designed to carry statements of truth about who owns what assets”. The coin can be mined using standard GPU hardware and was created to overcome the problem of centralized mining.

The recent problems with the GameStop squeeze in the stock market have also seen traders move their assets out of Wall Street exchanges to trade in the decentralized world.

Raven’s development team saw this and commented on Twitter:

Ravencoin was specifically designed and developed with securities as a major use case. Specifically, the problems being seen in public markets due to bad ledgers may be solved by distributed ledger technology.

The recent gains in these coins could mean that further big moves are ahead as retail investors increasingly catch the trading bug.","Bloomberg

Janet Yellen on Monday said bitcoin is an ""extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions.""

The Treasury Secretary expressed concern that bitcoin is used ""often for illicit finance.""

The comments come a day after bitcoin hit a new record of $58,042.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday expressed doubts about the utility of bitcoin as payment method and warned investors of the risks involved in using the world's most famous cryptocurrency.

""I don't think that bitcoin is widely used as a transaction mechanism,"" Yellen told the DealBook DC Policy Project. ""It's an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions and the amount of energy that's consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.""

Bitcoin mining has been known to consume high amounts of energy, with total worldwide electricity consumption higher than that of Argentina, the Netherlands, and the United Arab Emirates, and soon to eclipse Norway's, according to the BBC.

Meanwhile, interest in bitcoin mining is on the rise as the asset rallies, and miners earned a combined $1.1 billion in January, up 62% from December.

Apart from energy concerns, critics have also long said bitcoin is primarily a tool to conduct illegal activities, such as money laundering or drug trafficking, a concern that Yellen echoed in her talk.

""To the extent it is used, I fear it's often for illicit finance,"" Yellen said. ""It is a highly speculative asset and you know I think people should be aware it can be extremely volatile and I do worry about potential losses that investors can suffer.""

The comments by the Treasury Secretary come a day after bitcoin hit a new record of $58,042, bringing its year-to-date gain to over 100%. On Friday, the popular cryptocurrency reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Despite pulling back on Monday, bitcoin is still trading above the $53,000-level.

Yellen joins a a growing chorus of regulators who have given their thoughts on the cryptocurrency as it climbs to dizzying heights. Some regulators, such as ECB president Christine Lagarde, believe it should be regulated on a global level.

""I think that there are criminal investigations that have taken place that I'm sure will continue to take place that demonstrate it very clearly,"" Lagarde told Reuters in January.

Lagarde said bitcoin is not a currency but is instead a ""highly speculative asset which has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity.""

Bitcoin traded at $53,193 at 1:57PM E.T. on Monday.","ETH price perched above $1,850 after retreating from its recent peak of $2,036

Ethereum rallied to a new all-time high of $2,036 on 20 February, hitting the landmark price after a week of registering high after high.

However, bulls were unable to continue higher over the weekend and ETH prices have largely been range-bound below $1.9k. The consolidation could be what bulls need to build fresh momentum, in which case another leg up could see ETH/USD surpass the recent peak. On the flip side, bears could push prices to lows of $1,653.

In context, Ethereum’s consolidation also mirrors that being witnessed by last week’s super-performers Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB). While Bitcoin hit a new peak at $58,330 on 21 February, BNB had seen its price skyrocket to a new all-time high of $342 two days earlier.

Both coins are now consolidating above crucial support levels and could rebound higher.

Ethereum price short term technical outlook

ETH/USD is trading around $1,850 at the time of writing, perched just above the base of a price range within which it has traded for most of the past 24 hours.

The price action follows the swift reversal from the historic peak of $2036. The technical picture for ETH/USD suggests the second-ranked cryptocurrency remains in an uptrend. This provides for a short-term positive outlook, although bulls have all the work to do if they are to avoid ceding control to the bears.

As the 4-hour chart shows, Ethereum price remains above a long-term ascending trend line formed since early February. Keeping prices above this support line is therefore crucial to retaining the advantage.

If the ETH/USD pair breaks above immediate resistance at $1,890, the next move would be to the 20-day exponential moving average ($1,919). Above this resistance zone lies the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level ($1,950), where an influx of buy orders could help buyers target $2,140.

Bears might have it their way if prices fall below the ascending trend line support. From here, the potential bearish flip could strengthen if the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dips further alongside a negative divergence outlook.

The MACD is also showing a bearish divergence and could weaken further if ETH/USD falls below $1,800. A breakdown to the next support level ($1,736) could leave bears eyeing further damage towards $1,653.","Cryptocurrencies have gone mainstream, becoming an increasingly popular payment method and trade vehicle. Here's how to buy some on iPhone or Mac.

Alongside their growth in popularity, many cryptocurrencies have also grown in value. At the start of 2017, Bitcoin was just over the $1,000 per coin price point. About four years later, the price of a single Bitcoin is now about $50,000.

Whether or not the price of crypto like Bitcoin is going to keep rising is a contentious issue. Either way, if you're interested in buying crypto, there are several ways to do so on an iPhone, iPad, or a Mac. Here are some of the easiest and best ways.

The basics of cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that can be used to make anonymized payments in exchange for goods or services. To record transactions, cryptocurrencies use a public ledger system known as a ""blockchain.""

The blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies is valued for both its security and its privacy. There's no centralized authority, and a crypto coin isn't backed by a physical object, fiat currency, or commodity.

Unlike a fiat currency issued by a central bank, cryptocurrencies are decentralized. Transactions between buyers and sellers are only recorded in the blockchain. There's no middleman to facilitate and record transactions.

Because of all that, cryptocurrency trading is a bit like the Wild West.

Cryptocurrency values are also solely derived from what the market is willing to pay. That means cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile.

That volatility is an attraction to some traders wanting to make money buying on a dip. But it also means there's a high level of risk involved in trading and holding cryptocurrencies. You could lose money — just something to keep in mind.

How to buy and trade crypto on iPhone and Mac

As a result of the mainstream popularity of cryptocurrencies, there are now several different ways to buy them. You could go with a dedicated cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase, or you could opt for a more general trading app like Robinhood or Cash. These days, users can even buy crypto on financial tech and peer-to-peer payment platforms like Cash and PayPal.

Many of these apps are available either via browser, so users on macOS can access them, or as dedicated iOS and iPadOS mobile applications on the App Store.

Once you choose a platform, the process is straightforward and generally the same. You create an account, choose a funding source like a checking account, and follow the app's instructions for buying and holding cryptocurrencies.

But while the process may be the same, there are some critical differences between the platforms. For example, we'd advise against using PayPal or Robinhood to buy Bitcoin.

Here are our recommendations for the best exchanges.

Cash

Cash app is one of a few major peer-to-peer payment platforms that allows users to purchase and hold cryptocurrencies. But there are some reasons to choose cash over an alternative like PayPal.

Like Robinhood, Cash allows users to invest in stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrency. It's a mobile-friendly interface that's easy to use.

However, Cash app users can withdraw their cryptocurrencies to an external wallet. That means users can spend their coins how they wish, and it also offers a level of ownership and security beyond other platforms.

Because of that, Cash is a good place for beginners to start experimenting with cryptocurrency buying. A potential con to the platform is that users can only purchase Bitcoin currently, though other coins may be supported later on.

The Cash App is available here. Users can also access the platform via browser through the website.

Coinbase

Credit: Coinbase

Coinbase is one of the longer-running and widely used cryptocurrency exchanges, and it hasn't courted controversy like some others. It's a solid choice for those who have some experience buying and holding coins, though beginners won't be out of their depth on the platform.

Like other fintech apps on this list, Coinbase is simple to use. Once you set up an account and add a funding source, you can get going. There's also a Coinbase Pro membership that offers a few more perks for more experienced crypto buyers.

As with most well-rated cryptocurrency exchanges, users can withdraw their cryptocurrency to external wallets. If you don't want to bother with setting up your own wallets, Coinbase stores many of its assets in safer, offline storage that isn't as vulnerable to hackers.

The platform is not free to use, however. There are transaction fees and spread pricing that can drive up the cost of buying large amounts of crypto. It also doesn't support as many ""altcoins"" as other platforms, like Binance.

You can download Coinbase on the App Store here. The website for Mac users is here. If you sign up using this affiliate link, you'll be able to earn $10 worth of Bitcoin after meeting certain trading thresholds.

Binance

Credit: Binance

Binance is another popular cryptocurrency exchange. Launched in 2017, it's similar to Coinbase but emphasizes trading alternative currencies beyond Bitcoin. That makes it a good option if you're interested in lesser-known crypto.

Like most other cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance charges fees for transactions. It offers purchase support for more than 50 cryptocurrencies — far beyond what Coinbase currently provides.

However, there are some downsides. Although Binance dominates in the global sphere, it's currently not supported by 13 U.S. states. Users cannot deposit U.S. dollars directly, though users can make purchases with a debit or credit card.

Because of that, Binance is probably a better option for more experienced cryptocurrency users or those based outside of the U.S. It's also a better choice if you want to bypass Bitcoin and purchase lesser-known altcoins.

International users can download Binance here, while U.S. users can download it here. It's also available via browser.

Bisq

Credit: Bisq

If you already know your way around the cryptocurrency landscape or are a privacy enthusiast, Bisq offers some features that could be attractive.

The platform is an open-source and decentralized cryptocurrency exchange and payment platform. You don't even need to sign up for an account to buy crypto on the app. You can purchase coins using a number of fiat currencies and other cryptocurrencies.

Unlike the other platforms on this list, it's also non-custodial. That means there's no centralized service holding your coins for you. It'll be up to you to safeguard and manage your private keys. In the cryptocurrency world, that's a strong positive for some.

However, this emphasis on decentralization also means that you won't get any support if you run into problems. Also, note that Bisq only allows users to buy Bitcoin.

Bisq is only available as a desktop-based, open-source application. There is a companion app that can connect to it, however.

How to store your crypto

""Not your keys, not your coins"" is a popular phrase in the cryptocurrency world. It means that if you don't have access to the private keys associated with your coins, you don't own them. Similarly, coins on a custodial account like Coinbase are more vulnerable to attack from a bad actor.

Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts recommend using ""cold storage."" As opposed to ""hot storage,"" which is connected to the internet, ""cold storage"" refers to a cryptocurrency wallet that's completely offline.

There are several ways to do this. The most extreme method may be to generate a bitcoin wallet using a site like bitaddress.org, write down the private key on a piece of paper, and store it in a safe location. One could also keep a wallet's private keys in a text file on an external hard drive not connected to the internet.

Users can also buy a number of ""hardware wallets,"" which are key fobs that plug into a computer or smartphone. Some popular manufacturers include Ledger, KeepKey, and Trezor.

In any case, the goal is to take the safeguarding of your coins into your own hands. You purchase crypto through an exchange — like the ones we mentioned — and send those coins to an offline wallet address. From there, you have ownership over your coins."

Speaking at the New York TImes DealBook conference , Yellen said that bitcoin is ""an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions,"" and expressed worries about its wild price fluctuations.

""It is a highly speculative asset, and I think people should beware. It can be extremely volatile, and I do worry about potential losses that investors in it could suffer,"" Yellen said.

Negative comments from Gates didn't help either.

In an interview with Bloomberg , Gates said that it was one thing for Musk and Tesla to invest in bitcoin, but that doesn't mean average investors should follow that lead.

""I do think people get bought into these manias, who may not have as much money to spare, so I'm not bullish on bitcoin,"" Gates said.

""My general thought would be that, if you have less money than Elon, you should probably watch out.""

In fact, Gates said in 2018 that he would short bitcoin if there were an easy way to do it. The cryptocurrency was trading for less than $10,000 at the time.

Despite the recent pullback, bitcoin prices are still up more than 65% so far in 2021.

Tesla's share price is now directly linked to the price of bitcoin after Elon Musk's company invested $1.5 billion into the volatile cryptocurrency, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush. ""Musk is now tied to the bitcoin story in the eyes of the Street and although Tesla made a billion paper profit in its first month owning the digital gold, it comes with added risk, as seen this week,"" Ives told CNBC via email on Tuesday.

He added: ""With Tesla diving into the deep end of the pool on bitcoin, Musk runs the risk that this side show can overshadow the fundamental EV (electric vehicle) vision in the near term for investors."" Despite some concerns, Ives still believes that bitcoin is a ""smart move at the right time for Tesla."" Ives estimated on Monday that Tesla has already made over $1 billion off its investment in the cryptocurrency. ""On the downside it's playing with firecrackers and risks and volatility are added to the Tesla story,"" Ives said.

Week of turmoil

Tesla and bitcoin have both seen big losses this week. Shares of Tesla fell more than 11% when the market opened on Tuesday, a day after the stock's biggest loss in months. Tesla shares closed down 8.55% on Monday, as investors betting on a pandemic comeback rotated out of Big Tech and piled into cyclical stocks. It was Tesla's biggest drop since Sept. 23, 2020, when it closed down 10.34%. Bitcoin's price descended further on Tuesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issued a warning about the cryptocurrency. On Monday, Yellen called bitcoin an ""extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions"" and warned about its use in illicit activity. She also sounded the alarm about bitcoin's impact on the environment. The token's wild surge has reminded some critics of the sheer level of electricity required to produce new coins. The world's most valuable digital coin has plunged 16% in the last 24 hours, sinking below $50,000 to trade as low as $45,389 at 4:10 a.m. ET, according to data from Coin Metrics.

Tesla's bitcoin bet

Tesla announced in an Securities and Exchange Commission filing earlier this month that it has bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it would start accepting bitcoin as a payment method for its products. Musk has been tweeting about the cryptocurrency on and off ever since, raising alarm bells in some corners. He's also been tweeting about other coins like Ethereum and Doge.","Why did this happen?

Accounting for the money spent to acquire the bitcoin it sold, Square said in its report, as filed with the SEC, that it generated $97 million in gross profits during 2020 from its bitcoin sales. Square said fourth-quarter gross profits were $41 million.

""During the full year 2020, we saw significant growth in bitcoin revenue year over year. While bitcoin revenue was $4.57 billion in 2020, up approximately 9x year over year, bitcoin gross profit was only $97 million, or approximately 2% of bitcoin revenue,"" Square said.

""Bitcoin revenue and gross profit benefited from an increase in bitcoin actives and growth in customer demand, as well as a significant year-over-year increase in the market price of bitcoin,"" the firm said.

Square noted in its report that Cash App's active user ranks have swelled because of its bitcoin offering, accounting for some three million customers who purchased or sold bitcoin in 2020:

""In 2020, more than three million customers purchased or sold bitcoin on Cash App, and, in January 2021, more than one million customers purchased bitcoin for the first time. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2020, bitcoin volumes per customer were up more than 2.5x year over year, primarily driven by buying activity, as existing customers continued to buy bitcoin and new adopters bought even greater volumes of bitcoin. Bitcoin has helped increase gross profit per active customer and engagement in our broader ecosystem as bitcoin actives use other products, such as Cash Card and direct deposit, more frequently compared to the average Cash App customer.""

Square also said that it expanded its bitcoin holdings beyond the $50 million worth it purchased in October:

""Square also announced today that it has purchased approximately 3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million. Combined with Square’s previous purchase of $50 million in bitcoin, this represents approximately five percent of Square’s total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020.""

As shown in the chart above, Square's bitcoin offering has come a long way since its inception in early 2018 in terms of volume as well as public visibility. Beyond the Cash App service, Square has devoted resources to bitcoin development.

CEO Jack Dorsey has become an advocate for bitcoin in the business world, and most recently unveiled a bitcoin development fund, in partnership with hip-hop artist and producer Jay-Z, backed by 500 BTC.

Dorsey said during Tuesday's earnings call: ""We're also going to double down on our commitment to Bitcoin and continue to look for new ways to connect our product lines within the Cash App.""

Nor is Square alone in seeking to offer consumer-facing crypto services via the traditional payments realm.

Last year, PayPal went public with its crypto offering in partnership with industry startup Paxos. PayPal has said it is investing in a new unit focused on crypto and digital currencies, with a long-horizon view to support central bank digital currencies should those gain traction in the world of payments.

For PayPal, the benefits are particularly visible in the form of user engagement, according to one of its executives.

""Every day we're seeing an incredibly healthy influx of first-time users. An increased engagement once they've made their first crypto purchases. Customers who have purchased crypto have been logging into PayPal at roughly twice their log-in frequency prior to actually having purchased crypto which is amazing,"" chief strategy officer Jonathan Auerbach said recently.

Payments giants Visa and Mastercard have both highlighted their growing crypto footprints as well. Earlier this month, Mastercard revealed that it would support payments made with stablecoins as part of a broader, three-pronged strategy focused on cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and CBDCs.

Editor's Note: This story has been updated with additional information. The headline has also been updated for clarity.","Major cryptocurrencies plunged early Tuesday as investors took some steam out of a rally that’s driven the digital assets to staggering prices.

The price of bitcoin tumbled 8.5 percent to $47,373.99 after falling as low as $44,964.49 overnight, CoinDesk data show, marking its largest daily decline in a month.

Dogecoin, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency that’s become an online cult favorite, recently plummeted nearly 12 percent to roughly 4.6 cents. And Ether, second only to bitcoin in terms of market value, sank 9.8 percent to $1,532.67 as of 9:40 a.m.

The selloff sent the cryptocurrency market’s total value down about 4 percent to nearly $1.5 trillion just days after it soared to all-time records, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

“Bitcoin’s price increases had started looking exponential recently, driven by speculative mania,” OANDA senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley told The Post. “As is the nature of such moves, an exponential move higher is often accompanied by an equally ugly correction lower as the herd simultaneously runs for the exit door at once.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk — one of crypto’s most prominent backers — appeared to kickstart the plunge over the weekend with a tweet declaring that the prices of bitcoin and Ether “seem high” even though his electric-car maker has invested $1.5 billion in the former coin.

The markets were also spooked by skeptical comments on Monday from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who called bitcoin “extremely inefficient” and “highly speculative.”

“People should beware it can be extremely volatile and I do worry about potential losses that investors could suffer,” Yellen reportedly said at a conference.

More signs of turbulence emerged Tuesday. New York Attorney General Letitia James forced Tether — a so-called stablecoin that was reportedly tied to the US dollar — to stop trading with state residents after alleging that the companies behind it hid about $850 million in losses.

And Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, had to halt withdrawals of Ether for more than an hour because of “high network congestion.”

Tuesday’s tumble underscored the volatility in cryptocurrencies just a week after bitcoin surged above $50,000 for the first time.

Crypto prices have surged in recent months as a growing number of institutional investors and major companies such as Tesla and Mastercard started treating the digital coins like more mainstream investment assets.

But skeptics have argued that these kinds of wild price swings could be an obstacle to cryptocurrency’s popularity among investors.

“While high volatility is far from unusual in cryptocurrencies, it could slow Bitcoin from becoming mainstream,” Axi market analyst Milan Cukovic said.

With Post Wires","Bitcoin accounted for more than 80% of cryptocurrency inflows last week as the world’s largest cryptocurrency attracted $412 million in BTC-related investment products. The overall crypto inflows last week stood at $492 million, a 20% drop compared to $602 million in the second week of February.

According to the latest weekly crypto fund inflows report published by CoinShares, the recent price surge in cryptocurrency assets pushed the total crypto-related investment products under management to a record $52.6 billion. Bitcoin remained the focused digital asset last week.

Finance Magnates earlier reported about the record weekly inflows in ETH-related investment products last week after the world’s second-largest digital asset attracted $216 million investment in just 7 days. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $1,600 with a total market cap of nearly $185 billion.

“The recent price rises in digital assets has led to total investment products under management rising to a record $52.6 billion, with four products now being above the $1 billion mark. Inflows this week focused on Bitcoin with $412 million while both Ethereum and Polkadot saw continued inflows of $47 million and $6 million respectively. This year, the inverse relationship between the US Dollar (USD) and Bitcoin has been tested, as recent better-than-expected US economic data has led to more USD resilience. We believe the ongoing demand for Bitcoin from corporates and investors has helped support prices despite USD strength,” CoinShares mentioned in the report.

Institutional Bitcoin Holders

Due to the rising interest in cryptocurrencies, large institutions are accumulating Bitcoin and other digital assets rapidly. MicroStrategy raised nearly $1 billion last week to purchase BTC and the world’s largest electric-car company, Tesla is already up significantly on its Bitcoin bet. Grayscale remained the largest institutional holder of digital assets. The asset manager has more than 655,000 BTC and 3.16 million ETH under management with a combined value of nearly $41 billion. The total value of Grayscale’s digital assets under management stands at around $42.2 billion.","Bitcoin was on the brink of entering a bear market Tuesday as the volatile crypto asset suffered a double-digit plunge over the past 24-hour period.

A single bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.45% was trading at $47,944.40, down around 10%, on CoinDesk, representing a roughly 18% skid for the popular digital asset from its rise over the weekend to a record at $58,332.36. The world’s No. 1 crypto had tumbled by at least 20% from that recent peak at one point over the past 24 hours, meeting the commonly used definition for a bear market.

To be sure, bitcoin’s wobbles aren’t unusual but the crypto’s reputation for volatility is one reason naysayers contend it isn’t suited to serve as a medium of exchange.

Why is bitcoin’s price down?

Indeed, that was a point raised by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday during a New York Times DealBook conference.

“To the extent it is used I fear it’s often for illicit finance. It’s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that’s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering,” the former Fed chairwoman said.

Yellen’s comments have been cited as a reason for bitcoin’s recent losses. However, Yellen’s assessment of bitcoin as a inefficient medium of exchange is an important point and one that has already been raised in the past by bitcoin bulls.

Using a volatile asset in exchange for goods and services makes little sense if the asset can tumble 10% in a day, or surge 80% over the course of a two months as bitcoin has done in 2021, critics argue.

To put a finer point on it, over the past 12 months bitcoin has registered 8 corrections, defined as a decline from a recent peak of at least 10% but not more than 20%, and two bear markets, which are defined as falls of 20% or more, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

By comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.01% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.05% have had one correction that then fell further into a bear market over the past year and gold GC00, -0.02% , considered one of bitcoin’s rivals as a store of value, has had two corrections (including its current one) but has avoided slipping into a bear market over the past year.

Some have also attributed bitcoin’s recent retrenchment to comments from newfound crypto enthusiast Elon Musk, the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.93% , who tweeted on Saturday that the price of bitcoin and the No. 2 most popular crypto, Ether ETHUSD, -6.67% , which runs on the ethereum blockchain, were too high.

Tesla shares, meanwhile, have tumbled into bear-market territory, dropping more than 20% from a Jan. 26 record close. Analysts have tied the weakness to bitcoin’s slide, with Tesla earlier this month announcing it had purchased $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency.

Check out: Tesla stock’s drop likely related to bitcoin bet

Other theories on bitcoin’s downturn include the idea that the drop is down largely to profit-taking, with some holders taking profits near its weekend peak. that some owners have taken profits, selling bitcoin during its weekend peak.

Should I invest in bitcoin?

Many critics warn that bitcoin and other cryptos are purely speculative assets that could be regulated out of existence, knocking their price to zero.

It is just not clear what the future holds for cryptos or if bitcoin specifically will emerge as the dominant virtual asset to rule them all.

Although Yellen’s comments were credited with bringing down the price of bitcoin and its rivals, the Treasury secretary’s remarks could be ultimately viewed as constructive for digital assets in general.

She also said, during her interview with the Times, that digital payments, which the Fed and other central banks across the globe have explored, could lead to “faster, safer and cheaper payments,” which she described as important goals.

That is hardly a knock on bitcoin, but it isn’t a full-throated endorsement of the cryptocurrency or other cryptos since fiat-backed digital assets or central bank digital currencies are viewed in a different class to cryptographically backed assets.

Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a Tuesday note, characterized the bitcoin pullback as a bit of hiccup and said he wouldn’t surprised to see it retake $50,000 at some point, but notes that it had been overbought and was vulnerable to a downturn.

Read: Bitcoin drops further below key $50,000 level after Yellen calls it ‘extremely inefficient’

“Bitcoin fever hasn’t gone away all of a sudden because Musk has questioned the price but his Twitter feed has certainly become a primary catalyst for the market,” Erlam wrote. “That probably won’t stop it surging back above $50,000 in the very near future and probably hitting new highs shortly after.”

He speculated that bitcoin could hit $42,000 or $40,000 before it stabilizes.

In any case, it is worth recalling that bitcoin enjoyed a parabolic surge back in December 2017, nearing $20,000 before it crashed early in the following year to a low of $3,000.

That low likely crushed new investors who bought into the asset for fear of missing out, or FOMO, but long-term owners or “HODL”-ers, who hold on to their bitcoin through thick and thin, were still enjoying monster gains.

Yves Lamoureux, president of macroeconomic research firm Lamoureux & Co., told MarketWatch that average investors need to be particular cautious in bitcoin and cryptos.

“Bitcoin offers the same predictable pattern,” he said. “Nobody wants it until we go parabolic…then most [people] get decimated,” Lamoureux said.

In the end, bitcoin buyers should beware.

Why has bitcoin risen sharply over the past year?

The recent run-up in bitcoin to a market value exceeding $1 trillion on Friday has more broadly been tied to institutions becoming more involved in the asset.

Those include PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, which back in November opened up its cryptocurrency platform to all U.S. customers after conducting a more narrow rollout, has helped drive bitcoin prices sharply higher in recent weeks and months.

More recently, Musk’s Tesla announced that it had acquired $1.5 billion in bitcoins in January and that it could accept the world’s No. 1 digital asset for payment in the future, helping to deliver a fillip to crypto assets broadly.

Cryptocurrency exposed companies including MicroStrategy and Riot Blockchain gained on Wednesday.

The jump coincided with bitcoin's rally back above $51,000 after Ark Boss Cathie Wood praised the token.

Shares of cryptocurrency-exposed companies rose in premarket trading on Wednesday as bitcoin climbed back above $51,000.

The token tumbled as low as 18% on Tuesday to $45,000 but has rallied back above $51,000 after Ark Investment boss Cathie Wood told Bloomberg Tuesday evening she remains ""very positive on bitcoin,"" and is ""very happy to see a healthy correction here."" Payments company Square's announcement of an additional $170 million of bitcoin also helped push the price back up.

MicroStrategy gained almost 9% early Wednesday, after closing down 21% Tuesday.

Wednesday morning the business intelligence firm run by bitcoin bull Michael Saylor announced it purchased an additional $1 billion worth of bitcoin, bringing its total bitcoin holdings to about $4.78 billion.

The $6.6 billion company run by bitcoin bull Michael Saylor now holds approximately 90,531 bitcoins.



Bitcoin mining companies Riot Blockchain and Bit Digital gained 12% and 8%, respectively. Marathon Patent rose 15%, and Ault Global rose 5%.

Meanwhile Blockchain-based e-commerce company Future Fintech gained 5%, and crypto mining hardware developer EBang was up 11%.











","Bitcoin's price roared back Wednesday after a sharp sell-off, climbing above $50,000 again as Square announced it had purchased $170 million worth of the cryptocurrency.

At 11:00 a.m. ET, the world's most valuable digital coin rose over 6% to a price of $50,061, according to data from Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency had earlier climbed as high as $51,369 but later pared gains.

Other cryptocurrencies also got a boost, with ether and XRP climbing around 11% and 4% respectively. So-called altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies, often climb in times of strength for bitcoin.

On Tuesday, Square announced it had bought 3,318 bitcoins at an average price of around $51,235. The fintech company, which is run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, said bitcoin now represents about 5% of its total assets.

It's not the first time Square has invested in bitcoin — the firm bought $50 million worth of the digital currency last year. Dorsey is one of bitcoin's most well-known proponents, having once said he believes it will eventually become the ""single currency"" of the internet.","Payments company Square, Inc. (SQ) beat analysts' earnings estimates yesterday for its fourth quarter performance and boosted its Bitcoin (BTCUSD) holdings, but its stock fell anyway on a revenue miss.

The San Francisco-based company reported revenues of $3.16 billion, up from $1.31 billion a year earlier, on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 32 cents. Analysts had projected revenues of $3.22 billion and EPS of 24 cents. Square's gross profit was $804 million, against forecasts of $798 million. The gross payments volume (GPV), or the amount of cash flowing through its payments system, came in at $32 billion against expectations of $32.1 billion.

The company also boosted its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 3,318 bitcoins worth $170 million during the fourth quarter. The latest purchase builds on its buy of $50 million worth of Bitcoin in the second quarter last year. The cryptocurrency now accounts for 5% of Square's cash and cash equivalent holdings.

Key Takeaways Square has purchased an additional $170 million of Bitcoin. The payments company now holds over 8,000 Bitcoin, representing 5% of its cash reserves.

Square beat analyst estimates for earnings but posted a revenue miss.

The company's business strategy is increasingly pivoting toward Bitcoin as cryptocurrency becomes an important part of its revenue mix.

Analysts say that Square stock, whose price surged during the pandemic, may see more gains going forward.

Square has also made other commitments to the cryptocurrency, including funding the development of its infrastructure and launching a $10 million Bitcoin Clean Energy Initiative to support the development of green technology that reduces the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. ""We believe the internet needs a new currency, and we believe Bitcoin is it,"" said Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square, during the earnings call yesterday.

Square's stock fell 4.3% in extended trading yesterday and was down 4.5% in after-hours trading as the broader market took a hit. As of this writing, Square stock is changing hands at $236.33, a decline of 7.9% from the day's start.

A Doubling Down on Bitcoin

During the call, CEO Dorsey announced the company's intention to ""double down"" on its commitment to Bitcoin. That decision is not surprising considering that the cryptocurrency is increasingly becoming an important part of Square's revenue mix.

Approximately 81% of the $2.17 billion in revenue generated from the Cash App – a peer-to-peer payments platform for trading stocks and sending and storing money – came from Bitcoin-related transactions in the fourth quarter. According to Square, 3 million users of the app bought or sold Bitcoin in all of 2020, and more than 1 million used Cash App to trade the cryptocurrency in January alone.

""Bitcoin revenue and gross profit benefited from an increase in Bitcoin actives and growth in customer demand, as well as a significant year-over-year increase in the market price of Bitcoin,"" the company stated in a press release. The income for Square from these transactions is not substantial since its margin cut includes conversion costs from cryptocurrencies to fiat currency. Even though Cash App reported an increase in revenue of 502% from the previous year, its gross profit rose by only 162%. In numbers, Bitcoin revenue from Cash App totaled $1.8 billion, and gross profit was $41 million during the fourth quarter of 2020.

The app itself has become the main driver of Square's revenues, accounting for almost 69% of the total revenue generated during the fourth quarter. There were 36 million Cash App users in 2020, and its customer numbers received a boost after government stimulus checks, distributed during the pandemic, were disbursed through it. The company's other division, Seller, which provides payment services to small businesses, reported $987 million in revenue.

Despite the pandemic, which crashed demand from its customer base of small businesses and retail establishments, Square's stock has skyrocketed by approximately 210% in the past year. But it may be primed for a correction, according to some analysts. ""Gains going forward [for the stock] are likely to be more modest,"" wrote Timothy Willis, an analyst at Wells Fargo. Willis said that investors had already factored in the growth prospects for Seller and Cash App in current valuations and cut the firm's rating on Square stock to ""Equal Weight"" from ""Overweight.""","In brief More than 106 million people now use cryptocurrencies, according to a new report.

It suggests that new adopters helped the price stay high during Bitcoin's most recent rally.

Cryptocurrencies are now used by more than 106 million people worldwide, according to a report by Crypto.com published today.

The cryptocurrency exchange identified a 15.7% increase in adoption in January alone and suggested that, while Bitcoin’s most recent rally was fuelled by existing users, it was new adopters who helped the price stay high.

Market growth was sustained by new users. Image: Crypto.com

What drove the surge in adoption?

Strong growth in Bitcoin’s price was the number one driver for the increase in users, according to the research, which incorporated data from 24 crypto exchanges.

But other likely factors include the popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi,)—a new financial ecosystem that uses blockchain technology to provide financial services without third parties.

Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin in adoption in August 2020. Image: Crypto.com

The Crypto.com data also shows that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, led the crypto market’s growth in August 2020, which coincides with the height of the DeFi boom.

Increased investment from institutions, led by Microstrategy and Square, was another big contributing factor, per crypto.com. (MicroStrategy kept this up, today revealing it has bought another $1 billion in Bitcoin)

After PayPal started offering the ability for its customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency in late 2020, adoption rates significantly rose then too, the researchers noted.

In a separate report published last week, Statista suggested that Nigeria is the leading country for cryptocurrency adoption; one in three of the data analytics startup’s survey respondents said they had used or owned cryptocurrency in 2020. Nigeria also dominates search traffic for the keyword “Bitcoin,” according to Google Trends.

And crypto adoption is also increasing in South-East Asia. Per Statista, one-fifth of Vietnamese survey respondents said they used cryptocurrencies last year—despite the central bank’s refusal to recognize the asset class as a legal means of payment.","The business intelligence firm said it now owns close to 90,531 bitcoins and will continue to buy more.

Major bitcoin corporate backer MicroStrategy Inc said on Wednesday that it bought another 19,452 bitcoin, worth around $1.03bn, swelling its holdings of the cryptocurrency and sending the company’s shares eight percent higher in premarket trading.

The company, whose Chief Executive Officer Michael Saylor is one of the most vocal proponents of bitcoin, bought the cryptocurrency in cash at an average price of about $52,765 each.

MicroStrategy, the world’s largest publicly traded business intelligence company, spent last year steadily amassing bitcoin after making its first investment in August.

The company earlier this month engaged in an almost $1bn convertible note offering with the proceeds used for buying bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s price has recently scaled record highs as major firms – such as Bank of New York Mellon, asset manager BlackRock Inc and credit card giant Mastercard Inc – backed certain cryptocurrencies, with Tesla Inc investing $1.5bn in bitcoin.

Square Inc Chief Executive Jack Dorsey promised on Tuesday to “double down” on the payment firm’s commitment to bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.

MicroStrategy owns close to 90,531 bitcoin, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of about $2.17bn and an average purchase price of around $23,985 per bitcoin, it said on Wednesday.

The company’s bitcoin holdings are valued at about $4.48bn, according to a Reuters news agency calculation.

“We will continue to pursue our strategy of acquiring bitcoin with excess cash,” MicroStrategy’s Saylor said.","Bitcoin has reversed its biggest two-day loss since March 2020, as prices returned to as high as above $51,000 on Wednesday after the derivatives market calmed down from an over-leveraged condition.

Bitcoin’s heavy losses earlier this week represented a retreat from price levels that some analysts characterized as euphoric.

But as prices stabilized around $49,000 on Wednesday, signs emerged that some of the excessive leverage had been wrung out of the market, implying the potential for a fresh more to the upside, analysts said.

The cost to fund bitcoin perpetuals swaps trades – a common way of betting on price movements in cryptocurrency markets, similar to futures contracts changes – have returned to “neutral territory,” according to the analysis firm Arcane Research. Prices even briefly traded above $51,000 on Wednesday after dipping below $45,000 on Tuesday.

Trading volumes on major exchanges have subsided following a furious level of activity in the past two days, with some $20 billion changing hands Monday and Tuesday on eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk. By late Wednesday, volume had registered just $4 billion.

On the technical charts, Wednesday has been an “inside day” for bitcoin, meaning the price range is completely within the bounds of prior day’s high-low range, according to Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies.

“This preserves the pullback despite the $50,000 threshold having been cleared,” Stockton said. “It appears that there is a short-term risk to the latest breakout point at the January high just below $42,000, which would be a natural support level.”

Also supporting bitcoin’s quick recovery from the sell-off is rising demand from investors who bought the price dip, expecting long-term gains.

“Bitcoin has rebounded from yesterday’s sell-off, with both retail and institutional investors using the fall in prices to add to their positions,” Simon Peters, crypto asset analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, said, citing Square’s new $170 million investment in bitcoin.

MicroStrategy, the business intelligence company led by CEO Michael Saylor that recently has become better known for its bitcoin holdings, said Wednesday it has bought another $1.03 billion worth of the cryptocurrency.

“With yet more endorsements from leading figures in the world of finance and technology, the direction of travel longer-term is clear – bitcoin and its peers are here to stay and are getting more integrated in our lives,” Peters said. “This bodes well for future prices.”

Not just in the West. The demand in bitcoin has increased in China, evidenced by the rising price of dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT) denominated in Chinese yuan since last week,on over-the-counter trading desks.

Ether reverses losses from early sell-off

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was higher on Wednesday, trading around $1,605.26 and climbing 5.55% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Ether continues to trade in sync with bitcoin and the correlation between the two cryptocurrencies has strengthened since Friday.

Meanwhile, ether is still overbought on the technical charts, indicating that further sideways or “choppy” price action is expected in the coming months, said Fairlead Strategies’ Stockton.

Elon Musk is tweeting about dogecoin again, this time sending the meme-based currency up 25% on Wednesday with a single-word tweet.

The Tesla CEO and SpaceX chief fired off a tweet at 8:00 AM ET with just one word: ""Literally.""

Attached to the same tweet was a photo of the meme-famous Shiba Inu in a space suit, planting a flag emblazoned with the word ""WOW"".

In a follow-up 10 minutes later, the billionaire tweeted: ""On the actual moon.""

Dogecoin as of 10:17 AM ET on Wednesday is trading higher by 23.11% to $0.0581.

Wednesday is not the first time a tweet from Musk sparked a rally in dogecoin, nor is it the second. The internet has coined the term ""Musk Move"" to capture the outsize influence the billionaire has in moving prices of everything from bitcoin to GameStop to Etsy.

On February 19, he caused another jump in the price of dogecoin after he tweeted to his 46 million followers that he bought some for his nine-month old son. Dogecoin surged as much as 16% following the tweet.

A few days before that, Musk encouraged major investors, also known as whales, to sell their shares, adding that he believes concentration among a few holders is the only ""real issue"".

Dogecoin, which started as a joke in 2013, has been propelled to fame thanks to well-known backers such as Musk, but also rapper Snoop Dogg and Kiss member Gene Simmons. For a short time, dogecoin was hovering around a market valuation of $10 billion, making it more valuable numerous well-known companies.

Unlike bitcoin, there is an unlimited supply of dogecoin.","Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger once again minced no words in his opinion on bitcoin at the Daily Journal (DJCO) annual meeting on Feb. 24, streamed on Yahoo Finance.

“I don’t think bitcoin is going to end up the medium of exchange for the world,” he said in response to a question about new technology disrupting the banking system. “It’s too volatile...to serve well as a medium of exchange.”

Munger is the executive chairman of the Daily Journal, a technology and publishing company that owns newspapers and owns judicial software.

The reason, Munger said, was that central banks like controlling their own banking system and their own money supplies.

“It’s really kind of an artificial substitute for gold,” he said.

Munger, as has been made clear by decades of running Berkshire Hathaway with Warren Buffett in addition to his position at the Daily Journal, does not like gold.

“Since I never buy gold, I never buy any bitcoin, and I recommend other people follow my practice,” he added.

Bitcoin, Munger said, reminded him of an old Oscar Wilde quote about fox hunting: “the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.” (The quote is actually: ""Fox hunting is the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible,"" from the play “A Woman of No Importance.”)

Another shareholder asked Munger whether the Daily Journal would follow Tesla’s lead and put bitcoin on the balance sheet. “We will not be following Tesla into bitcoin,” Munger replied flatly.

In the meeting Munger delivered plenty of more burns and digs at cryptocurrency, investment bankers (“they’ll sell shit as long as shit can be sold”) as well as brokers like Robinhood (“dirty way to make money”).

When asked what was more unbelievable, Tesla’s stock price or bitcoin at $50,000, the 97-year-old billionaire quoted the lexicographer Samuel Johnson: “I can’t decide the order of precedence between a flea and a louse, and I feel the same way about those choices.”

These are not the first times Munger — or Buffett — has bashed bitcoin.

Story continues

Back in 2018, Buffett called it ""probably rat poison-squared,"" and Munger called it a ""turd,"" but also cited similar reasons for not liking gold, the fact that there are better things to invest in. At that time, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was worth $9,800; it is now over $49,000.

“I think every time you buy a nonproductive asset, you’re counting on somebody else, later on, to buy a nonproductive asset, because they think they can sell to somebody for more money,” Buffett said at the 2018 Berkshire annual meeting. “It does come to a bad ending.”

“I think people who are professional traders that are going to trade cryptocurrencies, it’s just disgusting,” Munger added at the time. “It’s like someone else is trading turds and you decide I can’t be left out.”

On Monday, Elon Musk lost his position as the world's richest person , after losing more than $ 15 billion of his net worth in a single day. This after Tesla shares plunged more than 10% after investing 1.5 billion dollars in Bitcoin (BTC) .

With the recent drop, Tesla racks up losses by 25% in just one week, according to Forbes data. Thus, the electric car company has lost about $ 215 billion in market capitalization.

To put it in perspective, before the investment in Bitcoin , the company's market capitalization was around $ 844 billion. It now stands at roughly $ 620 billion.

The crash is, in part, the consequence of a general contraction in US markets, but there is also speculation that it would be due to the company's investment in cryptocurrencies.

What happened between Elon Musk, Tesla and Bitcoin?

On February 8, Tesla announced the billion dollar purchase of Bitcoin units for $ 1.5 billion. The transaction shot the cryptocurrency to an all-time high, surpassing $ 58,000 per unit . However, a few hours later it plunged to $ 53,000 , causing investors billionaire losses.

Many attribute the fall of the cryptocurrency to a tweet from Musk, where he said that the price of Bitcoin ""appears to be high ."" It is speculated that the words of the tycoon caused the recent fall of the Bitcoin and many specialists believe that he himself 'stood up' by criticizing an asset in which he had just invested.

Musk is no longer the richest person in the world

For several weeks now, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have been taking turns occupying the top spot in the Forbes Billionaire Rankings.

Last Wednesday, February 17, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX had a fortune of 191,000 million dollars, while that of the founder of Amazon was 191,300 million dollars, that's how closed the difference was!

However, after this series of losses, Musk's fortune declined about 13% in just one week, falling to $ 166.1 billion on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Bezos woke up Wednesday with a net worth of $ 186 billion and the richest person in the world.

Can Elon Musk come back and take Jeff Bezos' job (again)? We will have to be pending."

The company's IPO filing occurs during a time of increased interest and prices for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has appreciated by more than 73% this year and recently crossed $1 trillion in market capitalization. More importantly, mainstream companies such as Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Square, Inc. (SQ), and institutional investors are gravitating toward the cryptocurrency, using it as a hedging tool against macroeconomic instability.

Coinbase, which is North America's biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has a balance sheet that reflects recent volatility in crypto markets. It earned net income of $322 million on revenues of $1.14 billion in 2020, a significant improvement from its 2019 performance of $30 million in losses on revenue of $483 million.

Key Takeaways Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has filed to go public via direct listing.

The San Francisco-based company derives 96% of its revenue from transaction fees for trading.

It had income of $322 million last year, an improvement over its 2019 performance of losses amounting to $30 million.

According to business information platform Crunchbase, Coinbase has raised more than $547.3 million from investors since launch. Recent reports have suggested that it was valued at more than $100 billion in private markets. Coinbase is among a slew of technology companies that have opted to go public through direct listing – in which underwriters are not involved and new shares are not created – instead of an IPO. The company will list on Nasdaq and will trade under the ticker symbol COIN.

Crypto Markets Come of Age

The Coinbase IPO represents a coming-of-age for the nascent crypto economy. Bitcoin, which was launched more than 12 years ago, has largely been positioned as the antithesis of existing financial infrastructure, and Coinbase is its most visible symbol. The company occupies a prominent place in the crypto ecosystem. It was among the first cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and has a higher number of users – more than 43 million according to its filing – than The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW).

Coinbase has also benefitted from the identity shifts for cryptocurrencies over the years. Various avatars have been foisted onto cryptocurrencies, from their being a medium for retail transactions to a tool for economic empowerment. Each of these shifts generated news and drummed up additional interest in Coinbase and its products. More recently, the price volatility of crypto markets has found favor with investors searching for profits in an era of low interest rates.

To that extent, Coinbase's revenue is heavily dependent on transaction fees generated from trading on its platform. The company's filing states that 96% of its revenue comes from trading transaction fees. While retail traders still account for a major chunk of customers for Coinbase, the company's investor mix on its platform has broadened to include institutional investors. The 2017 run-up in cryptocurrency markets brought an influx of such investors to the company's platform, increasing their numbers from over 1,000 on Dec. 31, 2017, to 7,000 at the end of last year.","In this photo illustration, Bitcoin course's graph is seen on the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange application on February 12, 2018 in Paris, France. Founded in June of 2012, Coinbase is a digital currency wallet and platform where merchants and consumers can transact with new digital currencies like bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin.

Coinbase is seeking a direct listing on Nasdaq, according to paperwork the company filed with the SEC on Thursday.

The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US said revenue surpassed $1 billion in 2020.

Coinbase said it has 43 million verified users and 2.8 million users that make transactions monthly.

Coinbase Global has filed to go public, seeking a direct listing on Nasdaq, according to paperwork filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.

According to the form S-1 filed with the regulator, revenue has more than doubled in the last year, highlighting the growing appetite for digital currencies. Coinbase said it has 43 million verified users and that 2.8 million conduct transactions monthly. With bitcoin and ethereum, the platform supports more than 90 crypto assets for trading and custody.

""While we are still in the early stages of adoption, the market value of exchange-traded crypto assets was already approximately $782 billion as of December 31, 2020,"" Coinbase said in its filing.

Revenue in 2020 was $1.28 billion, a jump from $553.7 million in 2019, according to a consolidated operations statement included in the filing. Coinbase said it will not receive any proceeds from the sale of its Class A common stock by registered stockholders.

The filing for an initial public offering by Coinbase arrives at a time when the price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed in recent weeks. Meanwhile, there were an estimated 106 million crypto users worldwide in January, according to a report from exchange Crypto.com.

""Our objective is to drive the growth of the overall cryptoeconomy by serving the needs of all consumers who manage their financial lives on a mobile device, and every institution -- large or small -- that embraces the emerging internet of value,"" said Coinbase.","Coinbase on Thursday released its documents for going public through a direct listing.

In the filing, the trading platform cites Satoshi Nakamoto's identity as a risk factor.

The creator's cache of bitcoins could wreak havoc on the market if Nakamoto sold their collection.

Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.

Coinbase on Thursday released documents for its public debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange via a direct listing.

In the filing, the digital trading platform cited as a risk factor Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto — the pseudonym used by the person or group of people who created bitcoin.

If the identity of the creator was revealed, it could cause bitcoin prices to deteriorate, according to the filing.

The filing also referenced Nakamoto's personal stash of bitcoins, which totals over 1 million. As of February, one bitcoin was worth about $50,000.

Nakamoto could negatively affect Coinbase, the company said, and destabilize the entire crypto market if the creator d

ecided to transfer his bitcoins, which are valued at over $30 billion.

The creator was the first entity to ever mine for bitcoins, and Nakamoto's stake in the digital currency accounts for nearly 5% of the entire bitcoin market, as there are only 21 million bitcoins that can be mined.

Bitcoin's value has largely been driven by its deflationary tendencies. If 1.1 million bitcoins were released into the market, the digital currency's price would almost surely fall.

Similarly, Bitcoin has been praised for its decentralized nature. The currency is not beholden to any institutions or individuals. If Nakamoto was unmasked, that would place the currency under a single entity, which could discourage traders that bought into the currency for its decentralization.

Coinbase's success is largely tied to Bitcoin's rise

In a nod to the Bitcoin creator, Coinbase listed Nakamoto as one of the recipients of its public filing.

Coinbase — which is valued at over $100 billion — can attribute much of its success to Bitcoin and its creator, who in 2009 developed it as the first decentralized digital currency.

In the years since, Bitcoin has largely dominated the cryptocurrency world, rising over 400% in the past year alone to easily remain the largest digital coin by market cap.

Coinbase is poised to continue to benefit from the cryptocurrency's rise. The trading platform is the largest in the US and has over 20 million users.

The company's founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong, referenced the invention of Bitcoin in his letter that was included in the public filing.

""When I first read the Bitcoin whitepaper back in 2010, I realized this computer science breakthrough might be the key to unlock this vision of the future,"" Armstrong said. ""Cryptocurrency could provide the core tenets of economic freedom to anyone: property rights, sound money, free trade, and the ability to work how and where they want.""

Nakamoto's name first came to public attention after the white paper was released. The paper outlined the principles of a decentralized peer-to-peer digital payment system. In 2011, the creator moved on from the system but has remained a figure of public interest.

There has been much speculation over the years on the creator's identity. Names like the Bitcoin developer Nick Szabo, the entrepreneur Craig Wright, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been put forward as potential creators of the currency.

While it is unknown whether Nakamoto will ever choose to transfer their cache of bitcoins, it seems unlikely the creator will ever reveal their identity.

By maintaining anonymity, Nakamoto could avoid legal consequences. The untraceable nature of bitcoin has also led to its use for illegal goods and services on the dark web. In January, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for more restrictions on digital currencies like bitcoin because of their use in illegal financing.

The unveiling would also violate one of bitcoin's founding principles that was outlined in its white paper. If a creator was unmasked, it would pose a threat to the decentralized nature of the currency — a tenet Nakamoto put at the center of his plans for Bitcoin.","Cryptocurrency Adoption Passes Another Milestone Surpassing 100 Million Users

According to a new study conducted by Crypto.com, the total number of global cryptocurrency users has surpassed 100 million for the first time ever. The study, which measured the cryptocurrency marketplace’s size using onchain metrics, survey analysis, and internal data, recorded 106 million cryptocurrency users in January 2021.

January’s Bitcoin Rally Accumulated a 15.7% Jump in Global Users

Compared to December 2020, the 106 million users represent a 15.7% increase in just one month. What’s fueling the growth of the crypto market? According to Crypto.com’s research, it comes down to bitcoin adoption momentum.

Eric Anziani, Crypto.com COO had this to say to Bitcoin.com regarding the research’s findings:

Our study improves upon previously used methods to find a clear trend of growing cryptocurrency ownership. As more companies and merchants adopt cryptocurrencies as a treasury asset and means of payment, we expect 2021 to be a banner year for crypto mass adoption, bringing us ever closer to our vision of ‘Cryptocurrency in Every Wallet’.

Bitcoin smashed through its previous all-time high, pushing its market capitalization past $1 trillion. The growth shows no apparent signs of slowing down either as sentiment around cryptocurrency increases, especially as JP Morgan and BNY Mellon will start offering digital payment methods. Not even two full months into the year yet, investors are piling 10-digit figures into bitcoin. Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin at the beginning of February, and investment website Motley Fool announced a $5 million investment just a week later.

Bitcoin isn’t the only thing that’s fueling the demand for cryptocurrency. Several other factors are at play too. Crypto.com’s research attributes this rapid ascent to the growth of the decentralized finance (defi) market, the ability to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency through Paypal, and the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency are attracting new crypto users every day.

Defi Momentum is Growing

The defi market’s momentum is significant given the increased demand for ethereum and other altcoins like Binance’s BNB. The total market capitalization of coins locked in defi has grown from $690 million to over $11.7 billion, a significant number that’s encouraging new investors to enter the market.

According to Crypto.com’s research, ETH’s growth rate was higher than BTC in November and December 2020; BTC’s unique users grew by 1.5% in November compared to ETH’s 2.8% growth. In December, ETH’s change was nearly double that of BTC’s: 2.8% compared to 1.2%.

How accurate are all of these numbers? A total number of 24 exchanges were included in the research, and while Crypto.com has updated and improved its methodology since its last report, it does admit these figures may be subject to some small caveats.

How long do you think it will now take to reach 200 million users? Let us know in the comments section below.

Around 106 million people are now using cryptocurrencies around the world, Crypto.com estimated in a report.

deVere Group said its clients aged 55 and above are increasingly drawn to tokens like bitcoin.

The bitcoin price has soared this year and was up around 68% to $49,260 on Thursday morning.

More than 100 million people around the world are now using cryptocurrencies - and a growing number of baby boomers and Gen Xers are becoming interested in bitcoin and other tokens, according to two separate reports.

A report from exchange Crypto.com estimated that there were 106 million crypto users around the world in January, following a 16% jump in participants last month alone.

A separate survey from financial advisory group deVere found 70% of its clients aged over 55 had already invested in digital currencies, or were planning to do so, in 2021, despite bitcoin and others being strongly associated with younger, millennial investors.

Crypto.com's report said the surge in the price of bitcoin and other digital tokens had been a key driver of the increased interest in cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin touched an all-time high of more than $58,000 on Sunday, before tumbling briefly to $45,000 on Tuesday. Nonetheless, on Thursday morning the bitcoin (BTC) price was around 68% higher for the year at $49,260.

June and August in 2020 and January in 2021 were ""exceptionally strong months"" for increases in crypto users, according to Crypto.com research manager Kevin Wang.

""What we notice is that periods of strong growth come after periods of strong price performance in bitcoin.""

Crypto.com also cited a boom in Ethereum's token ether and institutional cryptocurrency adoption by the likes of PayPal and MicroStrategy as driving interest.

Nigel Green, chief executive of deVere Group, said the firm's internal poll of 688 clients showed that the recent boom in cryptocurrencies ""has captured the attention of people around the world - and not just so-called digital native younger generations.""

Crypto.com's figure of 106 million users was reached by analyzing data from the blockchains upon which cryptocurrencies are based, as well as data from surveys and exchanges.

The exchange said that a number of caveats applied to the research. They include difficulties in knowing whether on-chain users still own crypto and in capturing traders who do not transact, or use exchanges, which could mean the figure could vary in either direction.

Caveats also apply to deVere's research, with an internal poll of clients unlikely to represent the baby boomer, or Gen X generations, as a whole.

Baby boomers are the generation born in roughly the 20 years after World War II, while Generation X is the generation born between roughly the early 1960s and early 1980s, according to common definitions.","Why did this happen?

And it may now be looking to ramp up its crypto offerings further with its massive Bitcoin investment.

Square processed $32 billion in gross payment volume (GPV) in Q4 2020, posting a 12% increase from Q4 2019, per its latest earnings release. Square's growth mirrors that of the previous quarter , when it processed $31.7 billion in GPV as it bounced back from the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Square is doubling down on crypto. Insider Intelligence

Square's Cash App was the true star of Q4: The peer-to-peer (P2P) payments app closed out December with 36 million active customers, surging 50% YoY—likely driven by the increased momentum of its crypto trading service. Square is now looking to strengthen its crypto business by investing a massive $170 million in Bitcoin, following its $50 million investment in October, per the company's earnings call .

Square's crypto service reached new heights in 2020 as more consumers flocked toward digital currencies—likely helping boost Cash App revenues and engagement along the way.

The P2P payments app experienced a significant boost in revenues thanks to crypto. Cash App's Bitcoin revenues skyrocketed nearly 900% year over year (YoY) in Q4, reaching a value of $1.76 billion. This may be because consumers have taken more interest in digital currencies amid the pandemic as cryptos continue to become more prevalent—likely enabling Cash App to buoy Square's revenues.

This may be because consumers have taken in digital currencies amid the pandemic as cryptos continue to become more prevalent—likely enabling Cash App to buoy Square's revenues. Cash App garnered increased app engagement from users leveraging its crypto service throughout 2020. More than 3 million users bought or sold cryptocurrencies using Cash App in 2020, according to Square CEO Jack Dorsey. And in January 2021 alone, more than 1 million customers bought Bitcoin for the first time using Cash App—which is indicative of the app's growing platform engagement. This comes as consumers continue to warm up to cryptos: 45% of consumers said they prefer to invest in Bitcoin over stocks, real estate, and gold, per a survey conducted by The Tokenist.

As the crypto space heats up, Square can leverage its Bitcoin investment to maintain growth and engagement. Cryptos are starting to go mainstream, with a number of large players signaling support for the growing offering: Crypto payment service provider BitPay recently forged partnerships with the major mobile wallets, while Visa and Mastercard both plan to integrate digital currencies into their networks.

Square's recent Bitcoin investment likely points to additional crypto offerings coming down the pipeline, as it may look to follow in PayPal's footsteps and introduce crypto as a funding source within its seller network, which could enable Square to increase its merchant engagement and strengthen existing relationships. Square might also use its investment to build out existing crypto offerings, such as by expanding its Bitcoin rewards program for Cash App customers, for instance.

The move will reportedly better serve the needs of FD7 investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios in the cryptocurrency space. While Bitcoin presents stronger long-term opportunities, the popular cryptocurrency has become a relatively mature asset. That is why alternative successful coins have captured investor interest.

FD7 Ventures is sitting on $1 billion in Bitcoin under management, which means the fund is swapping 75% of its current assets. Instead, the fund is betting on the future of ADA and DOT, which have a combined market cap of nearly $65 billion. This compares with the value of all Bitcoin in circulation which recently crossed the $1 trillion milestone.

The excitement around the two tokens was apparent in the cryptosphere over the last few days. Polkadot price hit an all-time peak earlier this week ahead of its upcoming parachain auctions which will allow its network to connect with other established blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

FD7 Expects ADA and DOT to Outperform Bitcoin

There is a lot to watch out for on the horizon, including Cardano (ADA). The token has been trading in a robust uptrend for the past few months as its upcoming update will allow users to create tokens from scratch on top of the Cardano blockchain. The protocol update will require a hard fork that was scheduled to the mainnet on March 1.

“Aside from the fact that Bitcoin was first to market and society has given it meaning as a store of value, I think Bitcoin is actually pretty useless. Projects such as Cardano, Polkadot and Ethereum are the foundation of the new internet and Web 3.0,” Says Prakash Chand, Managing Director at FD7 Ventures.

FD7 Ventures said it has already begun the process of converting their Bitcoin to Cardano and Polkadot and expects to complete the conversion transactions by March.

“I’ve been lucky enough to spend lots of time with the brightest minds in crypto, and I’m willing to bet that each of Ethereum, Cardano and Polkadot will be more valuable than Bitcoin within the next few years,” added Chand."
2021-02-26,"Bitcoin and Ethereum markets could seriously deteriorate if the identity of Bitcoin's anonymous inventor — Satoshi Nakamoto — is revealed, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase warned in its initial public offering (IPO) filings. The San Francisco, California-based company also noted in the documents presented to the US Security Exchange Commission that the identification of the mysterious inventor could also adversely affect its business and significantly drop the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the cryptocurrency market. Although there is no public information about the creator of Bitcoin, the name Satoshi Nakamoto was pseudonymously used for the person, or group of persons, who developed the cryptocurrency first, in the Bitcoin whitepaper that was released back in 2010.

Coinbase said in its stock exchange filing that the identification of Satoshi Nakamoto will directly impact Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company also foresees that apart from the revelation of its identity, the investor's transfer of Bitcoins may hit the cryptocurrency market.

The reason is that Nakamoto is believed to own around a million Bitcoins — out of total 21 million in the world. This could be worth $40 billion (roughly Rs. 2,96,700 crores), with Bitcoin hitting the benchmark of $1 trillion (roughly Rs. 74,16,320 crores) in January. However, the identity of the creator is still a mystery.

The anonymity of Nakamoto helped make Bitcoin and Ethereum decentralised currencies in the worldwide economy. It is, thus, speculated that his identification could impact the by nature of the cryptocurrencies and bring them under the custody of a single entity. This could lead to discouragement among investors.

Coinbase's IPO filing also underlined that the negative perception of Bitcoin and Ethereum could also affect the cryptoeconomy and contract their value.

The document also mentioned that “laws and regulations affecting the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks or access to these networks, including a determination that either Bitcoin or Ethereum constitutes a security or other regulated financial instrument under the laws of any jurisdiction” could also affect the markets for cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin slid as much as 11% to below $45,000 on Friday before regaining some ground.

The currency's sky-high price triggered investor nerves in a volatile week for markets.

Bitcoin enthusiasts say the $45,000 level is key and that a ""buy-the-dip"" mentality could kick in.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

The bitcoin price tumbled as much as 11% on Friday, putting the world's biggest cryptocurrency on track for its worst weekly fall since the brutal sell-off of March 2020.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell as low as $44,200 on Friday morning, before regaining some ground to stand 8.4% lower at $46,716 at 10.10 a.m. ET on the Coinbase exchange.

The cryptocurrency had lost around 19% for the week on Friday morning. That would be the biggest weekly loss since a 33.5% decline shook bitcoin in March last year.

Around $150 billion has been wiped off the market since bitcoin hit a record high of $58,000 on Sunday and its market capitalization jumped above $1 trillion.

Nonetheless, the digital currency remained around 55% higher for the year on Friday.

A number of factors have weighed on bitcoin this week. Elon Musk appeared to trigger the sell-off by tweeting on Saturday that bitcoin and Ethereum's cryptocurrency ether ""seem high"". Musk has been a major player in the recent bitcoin rally, so his words carry weight with many investors.

The drop in the bitcoin price has also coincided with a broader pullback from the more expensive parts of the financial markets, including tech stocks and government bonds.

Some investors also fear that regulations are set to tighten around the cryptocurrency market.

US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen on Monday repeated her concerns about the misuse of bitcoin by criminals at the DealBook DC Policy Project, and said the amount of energy used in mining the currency ""is staggering.""

However, most bitcoin enthusiasts are not fazed by the recent fall in the price. They argue that it is natural for a market to pull back after skyrocketing so quickly.

Matt Blom, head of trading at Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange group Diginex, told Insider that a buy-the-dip mentality should set in at around $45,000.

""We could well go from $45,000 to $42,000. But I think that $45,000 to $42,000 level at the moment is rock solid. People are very happy for the price to be there, because they get to buy it there. It's just how the market works.""

Bitcoin rival ether has also suffered, falling dramatically from all-time highs of above $2,000 hit the previous week. The ether price (ETH) was down 7.6% on Friday morning to $1,504.","Will investing in cryptocurrencies make you rich or just drain your digital wallet? Here’s what to know.

Billionaire Elon Musk threw $1.5bn into bitcoin before tweeting that its value does “seem high.” Microsoft founder Bill Gates, a centibillionaire himself, recently warned investors against losing their shirts with risky cryptocurrency, telling Bloomberg News he is not bullish on bitcoin, partly for environmental reasons. And United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that bitcoin is inefficient for actually carrying out transactions and is highly speculative.

Yet bitcoin is the hot topic that keeps popping up. But with so much of the US technological, financial and political elite sceptical about its utility as a medium of exchange and its ability to be a long-term store of value, many are wondering what the asset is truly worth. Here’s what you need to know.

Is bitcoin trying to dethrone the dollar?

Bitcoin fans say crypto is the future and one day a decentralised global financial system will dethrone investment titans, central banks and government treasuries. They predict a borderless currency that doesn’t rely on any of the old institutions will be the only way to do business.

But because that is all still aspirational, there’s no guarantee bitcoin can break through the current institutional barriers — and push its value “to the moon” — crypto parlance for intergalactic success.

“It could go anywhere,” Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, told Al Jazeera. “But right now, I’m bearish. You’ll see significant pushback by regulators across the globe to corral what is going on.”

So is bitcoin worth nothing or on its way to half a million dollars?

Naysayers claim bitcoin is literally worth zilch, while enthusiasts say the value of one bitcoin is far higher than the approximately $50,000 the cryptocurrency has hovered at this week. At present, the market capitalisation of bitcoin is a bit shy of $1 trillion, making it the most valuable cryptocurrency by far.

JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts have said bitcoin’s value could rise to almost $150,000 over the next decade, while Mike Novogratz at Galaxy Digital has forecast a valuation of $500,000 by 2024.

Why does cryptocurrency tend to be such a speculative investment?

Some experts argue that the momentum investing of people piling onto bitcoin is a fad, making the asset more like a collectable, such as fine art. Others have likened it more to a fleeting trend, a flash-in-the-pan like the tulip mania of the 1630s or the Beanie Babies craze of the 1990s. Right now, bitcoin’s appeal relies both on flashy marketing and investor FOMO — the fear of missing out.

In this way, its value may never have any objective equilibrium point, and will instead always just be worth what buyers are willing to pay. Bitcoin derives value from its perceived scarcity and network effects.

Why is blockchain technology important?

Blockchain lets users verify each other’s transactions for the simple purpose of making sure they don’t use the same cryptocurrency twice, kind of like floating a cheque. These peer-to-peer transactions are pseudonymous but not fully anonymous, meaning that everything can be traced in the public ledger.

After a widespread payment system outage at the US Federal Reserve disrupted wire transfers and cheque clearing services this week, many bitcoin supporters argued on social media that blockchain could prevent the kind of disruptions that hit the Fed.

Some critics who argue that bitcoin is too volatile still see potential for the blockchain system to be widely used. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s supporters see a global financial system sea change under way that is buttressed by all the functions of cryptocurrency.

Can you actually buy anything with bitcoin right now?

At the moment, acceptance is still limited. Amazon uses third-party service Purse to take bitcoin payments for e-commerce products. In 2014, Overstock became the first big online retailer to welcome bitcoin on its platform. And Tesla also announced it would soon accept bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles.

In the cryptocurrency world, the old lines have blurred and do not fully distinguish currencies from securities and commodities.

“We’re moving to a world where value is inherently fluid,” Lewis Cohen, a crypto lawyer, said at the virtual Bloomberg Crypto Summit on Thursday. “In the past, there was a distinction between money and everything else. Now, it’s not so clear.”

What about the environmental cost?

The market’s appetite for bitcoin has prompted some doubters to double down on their criticisms about cryptocurrency being environmentally unfriendly.

Mining for cryptocurrency involves complex computer calculations to verify transactions, which requires massive amounts of electricity to power the computers as well as keep them cool. Bitcoin is estimated to use more than 127 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, according to modelling by the Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge.

But bitcoin defenders say that the fiat currency system as a whole requires far more electricity to maintain — when adding up the power needs of banks and other institutions whose equipment and employees keep the dollar dominant. Cambridge University researchers acknowledge it is impossible to know how much electricity bitcoin uses for a variety of reasons, and more data is needed to determine its environmental impact as a whole, especially because some bitcoin miners used renewable energy sources to power their operations.

So should I run out and buy bitcoin?

Increasingly, financial advisors are telling their clients to invest a small fraction of their portfolios in “digital gold” — around two percent, for example — as a way to diversify risk and get a piece of the cryptocurrency action.

Nic Carter, cofounder of Coin Metrics, said that bitcoin’s value is based on it being “highly transferable and programmable”. Despite there being no physical use for it right now, it’s easily deliverable — not like hauling a suitcase full of gold bars to your bank.

Tchir of Academy Securities, who calls himself bitcoin agnostic, points out that of the people talking it up, “most are heavily incentivised. They own it … like a penny stock on steroids.”

It could go anywhere. But right now, I’m bearish. You’ll see significant pushback by regulators across the globe to corral what is going on. Peter Tchir, Academy Securities head of macro strategy

Going back to that Fed outage, could buying bitcoin be a hedge against system failure?

Bitcoin could become more widely adopted as trust in the financial and political establishment continues to erode. Some people’s increasing lack of faith in conventional economics has driven them to invest in cryptocurrency as a global refuge against the possible collapse of certain industries or countries.

In turn, payment processing companies such as PayPal and Square have responded to the demand that customers have for bitcoin by announcing they will accept it as payment. And investment banks like Fidelity and Goldman Sachs are adding to their own exposure and also making it easier for clients to jump on the crypto bandwagon.

“The value of fiat currency is the productive capacity and assets in a country. Bitcoin, to the extent that it becomes a money instrument, draws on the productive capacity of the assets and people in the whole world,” Caitlin Long, the CEO of Avanti Bank & Trust, told the Bloomberg Crypto Summit.

Is bitcoin going to make me rich?

Only time will tell. Although bitcoin’s bubble may soon be smoothed over by mainstream adoption, the future is unpredictable for the world’s dominant cryptocurrency. And its popularity could be proof of an irrational frenzy, or a real sign of its ever-increasing international prevalence — and value.

For those who were lucky enough to purchase one bitcoin last March at around $5,000, their investment has grown about tenfold over the past year. The same can’t be said for those Beanie Babies gathering dust in your basement.","Historically, the stock market is the greatest wealth creator on the planet. Even though there have been short periods where commodities or housing have outperformed, no other asset has been able to hold a candle to the steady long-term appreciation of equities.

But everything changed when cryptocurrencies came along. The S&P 500's total return (i.e., including dividends) of slightly more than 10% per year since 1981 has been dwarfed by the average annual return of some of the hottest digital currencies.

If you had the foresight and fortitude to invest $10,000 into each of the following three ultra-popular cryptocurrencies five years ago (as of Feb. 24, 2021), you'd be sitting on well over $1 million today.

Bitcoin: $1.15 million

I won't leave you in suspense: Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is absolutely one of the three. A $10,000 investment in Bitcoin five years ago would have appreciated to roughly $1.15 million today.

Bitcoin has benefited from an assortment of traditional catalysts and brand-name business adoption. In terms of old-school catalysts, optimists continue to tout its 21 million token limit as a hedge against a constantly growing U.S. and global money supply, as well as its growing use among businesses.

More recently, Bitcoin has been boosted by increased acceptance from brand-name companies. Tesla Motors purchased $1.5 billion Bitcoin for its balance sheet, with CEO Elon Musk leading the charge of optimism for Bitcoin on social media sharing platform Twitter. Payment-facilitator Mastercard also announced that it would begin supporting select cryptocurrencies later this year, and Bitcoin will undoubtedly be one.

But there remain a lot of question marks concerning the staying power of Bitcoin's recent move to $50,000. For one, even with more businesses accepting Bitcoin than ever before, Fundera finds that only around 2,300 U.S. businesses out of an estimated 7.7 million with at least one employee accept it as a form of payment.

Additionally, Bitcoin isn't even the best at what it does. As a payments-focused network, Bitcoin can validate and settle payments in an average of 10 minutes. Comparatively, Stellar (CRYPTO:XLM) can do the same thing with its Lumens coin in a few seconds. Bitcoin has first-mover advantages, but it's unclear if it has staying power.

Dogecoin $1.75 million

Another cryptocurrency that's been leaving a trail of fire in its wake is Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE). A $10,000 investment five years ago would be worth over $1.7 million today.

The fire being lit under Dogecoin in recent weeks largely has to do with retail investors banding together on social platforms. Both Reddit's SatoshiStreetBets board and Twitter have served as the perfect sharing tools for retail investors to work together to drive the penny-priced Dogecoin higher. Even Elon Musk has gotten in on the action by pumping up Dogecoin on Twitter.

What's worrisome about this move is that there's genuinely no substance behind it. As an example, I might be critical of Bitcoin, but there are identifiable reasons why it's moved higher. For Dogecoin, simple pumping by Musk and retail investors seems to be the only reason it's up over 1,000% in 2021. Dogecoin lacks any true differentiation from other alt-coins and has very limited utility. This is to say that very few merchants are willing to accept it as a form of payment.

If you needed any more proof that Dogecoin should be avoided, just brush up on its origins. It was developed in a matter of hours by two engineers in 2013. They thought it would be amusing to combine two of the buzziest internet topics at the time (cryptocurrency and a Shiba Inu dog meme) into a digital currency.

Suffice it to say, the only people laughing now are those who managed to sell their Dogecoin to an even higher bidder. This isn't an asset that should be in your portfolio.

Ethereum $2.52 million

The top-performing cryptocurrency of this trio over the past half-decade is Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). If you'd invested $10,000 into Ethereum five years ago and sat on your hands, you'd have over $2.5 million in your account today.

The Ethereum growth story revolves around its applications outside the financial space. Whereas Bitcoin, Stellar, and a host of other digital currencies are designed to expedite how payments are transparently and immutably logged, validated, and settled, Ethereum's underlying blockchain offers the potential to reshape supply chains, improve energy-trading platforms, handle real estate or title transfers, or ensure tax regulation and compliance, to name a few possibilities.

What allows Ethereum to stand out is its incorporation of smart contracts. These are protocols agreed upon by parties that help to verify, facilitate, and enforce the negotiation of a contract. For example, if all parties agreed that a certain product should be automatically reordered once 70% of that existing product is sold, a smart contract could execute that order. Because Ethereum isn't tied down to just the financial sector, it may offer greater potential than Bitcoin.

However, enterprise adoption of blockchain hasn't exactly been robust. With brand-name businesses unwilling to make the costly and time-consuming switch to blockchain-based networks, Ethereum's future remains pinned on the hope that companies become more trusting of the technology.

I'm personally a much bigger fan of investing in ancillary cryptocurrency stocks than in digital currencies themselves. But among the three listed here, I believe Ethereum's Ether token has the most convincing backstory and outlook.","Coinbase more than doubled its revenue last year and booked a profit for the first time, the exchange revealed in paperwork filed with the regulator as it pushes for a stock listing on public markets. The offering could fetch the highest valuation of any US tech company during a market debut.

Coinbase's S-1 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed that it booked revenue of $1.14 billion in 2020 and net income of $322 million. In the previous year, its revenue stood at $483 million and it registered a loss of $30.4 million.

Estimates of Coinbase's valuation have climbed in recent weeks, as it wends its way through the initial public offering (IPO) process. It was valued at $100 billion in private market trading last week, up from $77 billion the week before.

Bitcoin fell from $51,839 to as low as $44,060 in the last 24 hours of trading. Messari

The vast majority of companies that went public last year were unprofitable, according to Bloomberg. This means Coinbase's rapid growth, high revenues and significant profits are likely to be prized in the market.

Coinbase's eventual public offering is likely to increase its valuation, making it the largest IPO of any US tech company since Facebook, according to Axios. Facebook was valued at $104 billion upon listing.

The Coinbase filing is a trove of information about the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. The firm revealed it holds about $230 million in Bitcoin and $53 million in Ether on its own balance sheet. Coinbase would be among the public companies that hold cryptocurrencies in their treasuries, like MicroStrategy, Square and Tesla.

The Coinbase filing shows that institutional trading volume accounts for an increasingly large part of its business. Trading volumes from institutions grew from about 20% in the first quarter of 2018 to 66% in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to data compiled from the filing by The Block. Institutional business for 2020 stood at 63% of $192 billion traded.

Coinbase reported a jump of 34% in verified users to 43 million in 2020 compared to the previous year. The number of monthly transacting users rose 180% to 2.8 million last year, according to data compiled from the filing by Bloomberg.

Coinbase is choosing to offer its shares publicly with a method known as a direct listing, which lets individual investors access the stock at the same time as institutions. It won't raise any new funds with the offering. Coinbase plans to trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker COIN.","The native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain, ADA, has broken to a fresh all-time high at $1.30 per coin. That’s good enough to become the third-largest cryptocurrency when measured by market capitalization at $39 billion.

A competitor to the Ethereum blockchain, Cardano was launched in 2017 and is mainly backed by business venture Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK). The blockchain is the creation of Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, who is now CEO of IHOK.

ADA has been swept up in bitcoin’s bull market, even though Cardano has no major decentralized finance (DeFi) or other applications running on it like other Ethereum competitors such as Binance Smart Chain. The cryptocurrency is up 645% in the past 90 days, according to Messari.

Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, have suffered under a price correction following months of double-digit percentage gains. Bitcoin is down 6% on the day to $46,800 while ether is down 6% at $1,490 as of press time.

ADA recently traded at $1.25, up 10% in the last 24 hours.","Bitcoin, BTC to USD, fell by 1.77% on Friday. Following on from a 5.14% slide on Thursday, Bitcoin ended the day at $46,318.0.

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to a late morning intraday low $44,027.0 before making a move.

The reversal saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $45,212 and the 23.6% FIB of $45,501.

Finding late morning support, Bitcoin rose to a late afternoon intraday high $48,441.0 before hitting reverse.

Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $50,651, Bitcoin slid back to sub-$47,000 levels and into the red.

Despite the late sell-off, Bitcoin avoided a fall back through the 23.6% FIB and the major support levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the current week reversal. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $24,751 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Friday.

Cardano’s ADA rallied by 15.62% to lead the way.

Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.20%), Chainlink (+2.08%), and Polkadot (+2.42%) also ended the day in the green.

It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors, however.

Binance Coin (-5.50%), Crypto.com Coin (-6.87%), Litecoin (-5.07%) led the way down.

Ethereum (-2.49%), and Ripple’s XRP (-1.54%) saw relatively modest losses on the day.

In the current week, the crypto total market cap rose to a Monday high $1,748.98bn before sliding to a Tuesday low $1,291.06bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $1,417.61bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Tuesday high 64.74% before falling to a Wednesday low 61.25%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.03%.

This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.75% to $47,130.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning low $46,173.0 before rising to a high $47,247.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the broader crypto market.

Story continues

Crypto.com Coin was down by 3.68% to buck the trend early on.

It was a bullish start to the day for the rest of the majors, however.

At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 5.17% to lead the way.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall back through the pivot level at $46,262 to bring the first major resistance level at $48,497 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from Friday’s high $48,441.0.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $49,000 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $52,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $50,676.

Failure to avoid a fall back through the $46,262 pivot would bring the 23.6% FIB of $45,501 and the first major support level at $44,083 into play.

Barring an extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of the second major support level at $41,848.

More From FXEMPIRE:","The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has fallen sharply along with the cryptocurrency itself SOPA Images/Getty Images

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust plunged this week as the price of bitcoin has tumbled.

The trust's share price closed at a 3.77% discount on Thursday, a sharp reversal from recent hefty premiums.

The bitcoin price itself has plunged around 20% this week, the biggest weekly drop since March 2020.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's shares have plunged almost 20% this week, marking the biggest drop in the world's largest bitcoin fund in close to a year.

Grayscale's closing price of $45.64 on Thursday meant the fund's public shares had fallen more than bitcoin itself over the week.

The trust's shares closed at a 3.77% discount to net asset value on Thursday, a sharp reversal after trading at hefty premiums as the bitcoin price soared in recent months. It is the first discount since March 2017, according to Bloomberg data.

Investors have sold shares in the Grayscale Trust at a rapid rate over recent days as bitcoin has tumbled from a high of $58,000 on Sunday. The fund has a total of $32.83 billion in assets under management, according to Bloomberg.

The fall into discount territory highlights the extent to which investors have cooled on the fund this week. Its public shares traded at premiums above 15% for much of January as investors used the fund as a key way to gain exposure to bitcoin.

Bitcoin was down around 8.6% to $46,669 as of 9.25 a.m. ET on Friday. It had shed close to 20% over the week, the worst decline since March last year, as investors balk at the sky-high price.

Yet most bitcoin bulls are unconcerned about the recent drop. They argue it represents a good buying opportunity and predict that the price will continue to pull higher.

Katharine Wooller, managing director of UK digital asset exchange Dacxi, told Insider that corporate interest from the likes of Tesla should keep supporting bitcoin.

""Be warned however, bitcoin is known to significantly correct,"" she said. ""Whilst the medium trend is positive for holders, it is both the sign of a healthy market and a buying opportunity.""

Grayscale chief executive said that it was ""certainly a risk"" that the GBTC's premium disappears, at the Bloomberg Crypto Summit on Thursday.

""But ultimately price discovery in GBTC every day is driven entirely by market forces,"" he said.

(This article has been corrected. It previously said there had been large outflows from GBTC, when in fact the Trust does not operate a redemption program.)",

Top Stories This Week

Bitcoin has had an exceptionally trying week, and it doesn’t bode well for March — a month that’s traditionally bearish for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.

After hitting record highs of $58,300 last Sunday, Bitcoin suffered a dramatic reversal of fortunes — crashing to $46,000 on Tuesday. Elon Musk might not have helped matters… in the run-up to the correction, he had tweeted that BTC and ETH seemed high.

Analysts and investors alike breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday when Bitcoin managed to retake $50,000 — with some proclaiming that the asset had undergone a “healthy correction.” But this narrative proved shaky when BTC plunged yet again on Friday to lows of $44,454.84.

All of this comes amid a backdrop of unease in the traditional markets, and this week’s price activity suggests BTC faces an uphill struggle if it’s going to appreciate further. Generally, analysts are looking for $50,000 to become an established support before expecting any bullish continuation.

A flurry of good news throughout the week may have prevented things from going bad to worse for Bitcoin. Early in the week, two institutions announced they were doubling down on their BTC buy-ins.

MicroStrategy purchased an additional 19,452 coins, with CEO Michael Saylor declaring that his company has no intention of slowing down. It came after Square announced it had purchased 3,318 BTC for $170 million — following on from a $50-million spending spree in October 2020.

Bitfinex and Tether also announced that they had reached a settlement with the New York attorney general, linked to ongoing allegations that Tether misrepresented the degree to which USDT stablecoins were backed by fiat collateral. Under the terms of the deal, both companies will have to pay $18.5 million in damages, report on their reserves periodically, and stop serving customers in the state.

On Friday, JPMorgan helped to cheer up the markets by telling clients that allocating 1% of a portfolio to Bitcoin would serve as a hedge against fluctuations in stocks, bonds and commodities.

Moving beyond Bitcoin, there’s been a lot of movement in the altcoin markets.

Last week, Binance Coin had stolen the show with a stunning triple-digit surge that helped it become the world’s No. 3 cryptocurrency. Fast forward to this week, and it’s now been overtaken by Cardano’s ADA.

A fresh wave of optimism and buying volume on Friday pushed its price to a new all-time high, and momentum for the project has been building throughout February. Open interest for ADA futures also rose to $580 million, surpassing Litecoin to become the third-largest derivatives market.

Despite NFTs entering into a bull market — with a report suggesting that they’ll explode in popularity even more as 2021 continues — it’s definitely been a week to forget for Ether. After touching new all-time highs of $2,000 last weekend, ETH has tumbled by more than 26% this week… taking it below $1,500 at times.

All of this comes as an exodus from the Ethereum blockchain continues, with 1inch becoming the latest DeFi project to expand to Binance Smart Chain.

As the old saying goes: “The sun don’t shine on the same dog’s ass every day.”

The sun was certainly shining on Elon Musk when the week began. One analyst had suggested that Tesla had made $1 billion in profit since making its Bitcoin investment. That’s more than the profit generated by selling electric vehicles (what it’s known for) across the whole of 2020.

Alas, that was before the carnage seen on the crypto markets. To make matters worse, Tesla’s share price has dropped by more than 20% from the highs of $890 seen on Jan. 26. These joint factors prompted Musk to lose his crown as the world’s richest man. Some analysts wasted little time in attributing TSLA’s crash to its association with Bitcoin.

But there’s another threat on the horizon, with reports suggesting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could investigate Musk’s alleged impact on BTC and DOGE through his many, many tweets.

The billionaire made a concerted effort to shrug off these concerns, suggesting he would even welcome such a probe.

We’ve been learning a lot more about Coinbase this week as it gears up to launch on the stock market. One particular hipster-ish announcement came when the exchange declared that it’s held Bitcoin and other cryptos on its balance sheet for nine years.

Coinbase sought to package this announcement as a paean to other corporations that might be considering a similar move — touting itself as an authority in advising institutions about how to deal with their own prospective investments.

In other news, the company submitted its S-1 report to the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. The filing revealed that the exchange generated revenues of $1.1 billion in 2020 — 96% of which came from transaction fees. Net income in 2020 came in at $327 million… a stark contrast to the $46 million loss seen the year before.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $46,609.99, Ether at $1,470.17 and XRP at $0.43. The total market cap is at $1,429,222,267,885.

Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Fantom, Pundi X and Cardano. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Dodo, Horizen and Venus.

Prediction of the Week

We love an outlandish prediction here at Hodler’s Digest… and Michael Saylor certainly delivered the goods this week.

The MicroStrategy CEO declared that Bitcoin will be the savings method of choice for a staggering 1 billion people in just five years’ time. That’s despite the fact that just 21 million BTC exist… and his company already owns 90,000 of it.

Saylor’s comments came after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen launched her latest attack on Bitcoin, describing it as “inefficient.”

In a confident interview with CNBC, he declared that Bitcoin “is the dominant digital monetary network,” adding: “I think you can expect that we’ll have a billion people storing their value — in essence, a savings account — on a mobile device within five years, and they’re going to want to use something like Bitcoin.”

FUD of the Week

Microsoft founder Bill Gates had a big warning for Bitcoin buyers this week.

Speaking to Bloomberg, he warned: “Elon has tons of money, and he’s very sophisticated so, you know, I don’t worry that his Bitcoin would randomly go up or down.”

Gates said it would be a mistake for the average investor to blindly follow the mania of optimism surrounding Musk’s market moves, telling those who aren’t billionaires to “watch out.”

Criticizing Bitcoin’s energy consumption, he added: “I do think people get drawn into these manias who may not have as much money to spare. So, I’m not bullish on Bitcoin, and my general thought would be: If you have less money than Elon, you should probably watch out.”

This isn’t to say that Gates thinks digital currencies are a bad thing. He just believes that they should be transparent, reversible and (essentially) centralized.

As you’d expect, a post-mortem is now fully underway after this week’s carnage in the crypto markets.

Curiously, data from Santiment suggests that the initial crash may have been linked to a huge transaction that took place after Sunday’s all-time high of $58,300. The transfer of 2,700 BTC — worth $156 million at the time — was the second-biggest transaction of 2021.

It’s possible that this whale cashing out contributed to unbearable selling pressure in the market, which snowballed into the largest one-hour candle in Bitcoin’s history. If enough alarm bells weren’t ringing, this self-same wallet also dumped 2,000 BTC just before last March’s infamous flash crash.

A prominent crypto influencer has warned that Ethereum’s competitors will continue to siphon away users should Eth2 fail to launch soon amid ever-increasing gas fees.

Lark Davis said Ethereum’s skyrocketing fees has meant that only “rich investors” can afford to use the network, prompting smaller users to switch to competitors like Binance Smart Chain.

Describing the current gas fee prices as “totally loco,” Davis urged Ethereum developers to expedite the launch of Eth2 in response to the skyrocketing to prevent a further exodus of users to cheaper alternatives.He added: “We’re now to the point where ETH 1.0 — oh, we need ETH 2.0 so soon, come on, Vitalik, get it going, man — ETH 1.0, most regular users are priced out of using the majority of applications on Ethereum. […] A transaction on Uniswap costs $50 on average these days, and that is just crazy.”

More From FXEMPIRE:","A closely-followed crypto strategist whose credibility in the crypto space rose after nailing Bitcoin’s collapse in March 2020 says he expects BTC to bottom out and print a new all-time high in the coming weeks.

In a new tweetstorm, the analyst known in the industry as Capo looks at a number of technical indicators to show why he believes Bitcoin has carved a bottom.

The trader explains that the steep decline in Bitcoin’s open interest, which refers to the number of contracts held by market participants, is bullish for the leading cryptocurrency,

“Same as the other time (January drop), open interest (OI) has dropped with the price. Late longs got rekt. This drop on the OI due to late longs liquidations mostly, has helped the funding rates to reset. Also, shorts are trapped. They think price hasn’t reached its bottom, so they are shorting the bounce, causing the funding to tend to be negative (bullish).”

Capo also highlights that a concealed divergence on both the Ethereum and Bitcoin charts between the assets’ relative strength index (RSI) and price may indicate that momentum is swinging to the side of the bulls.

“BTC and ETH RSI is forming hidden bullish divergences again, on the high timeframes. This divergence means trend continuation when confirmed. Pivot (invalidation) for BTC: weekly candle close below $33,000. Confirmation for BTC: weekly close above $57,000.”

In addition, the crypto analyst notes that whales are buying the BTC dip, suggesting that the largest crypto holders are building a new base for the next leg up.

“Institutions/whales keep accumulating at these levels. Coinbase Pro outflows going up like crazy.”

With Bitcoin gearing up for the next phase of the bull cycle, Capo believes that the leading crypto asset will skyrocket to a new all-time high of around $80,000 before the end of March.

“BTC new potential range between $60,000 and $42,000. Target after consolidation above the range high: about $80,000.”

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Tithi Luadthong","There's a recent mania taking over the investing world, and it's called cryptocurrency. Since the domain name Bitcoin.com was registered in 2008, the world has seen Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) rise and fall, hitting just under $50,000 per token on Feb. 15, 2021.

While many people are bullish on Bitcoin's prospects, many others feel it's just too risky for an average investor to hold in their portfolio. Which side are you on? We asked three Motley Fool contributors whether they're planning to add it to their portfolios, and why or why not.

The best cryptocurrency to buy

Jon Quast: When building a portfolio, investors should be more focused on stocks than cryptocurrencies. Stocks represent ownership stakes in real companies with intrinsic value. By contrast, cryptocurrencies are just zeros and ones -- they don't own anything, generate revenue, or have visions for creating shareholder value. Some do have practical utility, which is great. But lack of intrinsic value makes cryptocurrencies risky investments; it's a key difference between them and stocks.

That said, I would invest in a cryptocurrency, but Bitcoin is the only one I'd buy right now. Cryptocurrency prices are determined by supply and demand. The supply side of Bitcoin's equation is extremely simple. New tokens are continuously ""unlocked"" and released into circulation through mining. There are already 18.6 million in circulation, according to Blockchain.com, and there's only a trickle of about 900 new tokens per day as Bitcoin heads toward its ceiling. Its source code limits the total number of tokens to 21 million.

Other cryptocurrencies also have limited supplies. However, demand for Bitcoin sets it apart -- this is the one people want to own. Many other cryptocurrencies have launched, addressing Bitcoin's various shortcomings. Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains the cryptocurrency with the most brand recognition. So it's still the one people consider buying first, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.

Growing adoption creates a kind of network effect. After all, it's not so scary to buy a little Bitcoin once someone you know or trust has bought some. I believe we've seen this trend with individual investors in recent years. But in recent months, I think we've started to see it from Wall Street as well. Tesla wasn't the first public company to buy Bitcoin, but its $1.5 billion purchase could be a watershed moment.

Tesla's management indicated it bought Bitcoin as a small hedge against inflation. What if more companies followed Tesla's lead, taking just 1% of their asset value and putting it into Bitcoin? If just a fraction of public companies did this, demand would easily outpace new supply for much of 2021, leading to higher prices. If adoption from institutions and companies grows like this, I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin hit $100,000 per token this year.

However, to be clear, I'm not personally buying Bitcoin right now because I already bought some in 2018. And its recent surge in price has elevated the cryptocurrency to a large position in my portfolio. With a winning stock, I'd be tempted to ""double up"" and add to my winner. But I don't plan to do that with a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. I want to entrust the majority of my investing dollars to the companies creating shareholder value in the real world.

In short, I believe there's a good case for owning some Bitcoin -- but not at the expense of holding ownership stakes in top companies that are changing our world for the better.

Bitcoin for a retirement port?

Barbara Eisner Bayer: About seven or eight years ago, a 20-something friend introduced me to a new type of currency that, in his opinion, was going to take over the world. It was Bitcoin, and he had purchased a bit of it, even though he had no investing experience. He wanted my opinion, and as a buy-and-hold investor, I felt that the cryptocurrency was too speculative and there was no way I would ever buy it.

Fast-forward to today, and Bitcoin has come a long way. It made its TV debut on The Good Wife in 2012. Major companies like Microsoft, Burger King, and Home Depot started accepting it for payment, and Elon Musk's Tesla recently purchased a whopping $1.5 billion worth of it. Even Bill Gates said that ""Digital money is a good thing.""

In other words, Bitcoin has gone mainstream. In fact, it recently traded for close to $50,000 per token, and venture capitalist Jeremy Liew claims that it could be worth $500,000 per token by 2030.

I've been equally impressed and dumbfounded by Bitcoin's growth in the real world, and sometimes get a little upset that I didn't purchase some when my friend first mentioned it to me. But only a little upset, because my portfolio is on a focused path to funding my retirement, and I don't believe Bitcoin has a place there.

First of all, it's extremely volatile. It's reached huge highs, yet once lost 80% of its value. For a retirement portfolio, that kind of fluctuation is too ulcer-producing -- especially since, as I get closer to living off my savings, I want to preserve my assets. With Bitcoin, the risks are just too high.

Also, there's no guarantee that it will ultimately be successful as a means of currency, even though more businesses are beginning to take it. But you just never know. At this point, I see investing in Bitcoin as akin to gambling, and I'm not willing to take that chance right now.

Call me chicken, call me shortsighted, call me old-fashioned: I'm staying far away from cryptocurrencies. As Bill Gates told Bloomberg, ""If you have less money than Elon [Musk], you should probably watch out."" Since my fortune is nowhere close to Musk's, I'm going to take the Microsoft founder's advice and sit on the sidelines.

Passing up the hottest investment of the past decade

Sean Williams: I won't beat around the bush: I have no intention of adding Bitcoin to my portfolio. While I believe there's a future for blockchain technology, and understand that Bitcoin is benefiting from its first-mover advantage in the crypto space, there are a handful of reasons I choose not to invest in the world's largest digital currency.

Perhaps the biggest issue with Bitcoin is its utility. Although a greater number of businesses are willing to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, or have even added it to their balance sheets, research from Fundera notes that only 2,300 businesses in the U.S. accept Bitcoin. That's out of more than 30 million registered businesses in the U.S., 7.7 million of which are large enough to have at least one employee.

To build on this point, roughly 2% of all accounts that own Bitcoin hold more than 95% of the circulating supply, according to Flipside Crypto. Even though tokens are divisible down to eight decimal places (1/100,000,000 of a Bitcoin token is a ""satoshi""), there aren't enough tokens to go around for Bitcoin to offer game-changing utility.

I'm also concerned that Bitcoin lacks staying power. There's no question it's the most popular cryptocurrency at the moment. But among financial industry-focused blockchains, it's not even the best option. For instance, transactions on Stellar's (CRYPTO:XLM) network with the Lumen coin (XLM) can be validated and settled in mere seconds. Meanwhile, the average Bitcoin transaction takes closer to 10 minutes to validate and settle.

That's a vast improvement over traditional banking networks, but nowhere near the best among financial-industry-focused blockchain projects. In my view, this makes Bitcoin replaceable -- especially considering the virtually nonexistent barrier to entry in the crypto space.

History provides me with my final reason to stick to the sidelines. I've seen many next-big-thing investments ascend to the heavens -- the internet, business-to-business commerce, genomics, 3D printing, marijuana, and blockchain -- and the one constant is that all bubbles burst. This isn't to say winners won't eventually emerge from these trends, but investors almost always overestimate the speed of their uptake and their near-term potential.

Instead of adding Bitcoin to my portfolio, I'm perfectly content buying and holding ancillary cryptocurrency stocks that'll benefit no matter what happens to Bitcoin. For instance, I purchased fintech stock Square (NYSE:SQ) during the March 2020 coronavirus crash, and would consider adding more on sizable pullbacks. Square's peer-to-peer payment platform Cash App has seen a major uptick in Bitcoin exchange over the past year, which is providing a big lift to revenue. And Cash App can remain a major growth driver, no matter what happens to the price of Bitcoin.","In brief:

25,600 Bitcoin has left Coinbase in the last week

13k Bitcoin left Coinbase on the 25th of February

This shows that institutions are scooping up the Bitcoin dip with Coinbase facilitating a majority of the orders

Bitcoin bullishness might be reignited thanks to the passing of a $1.9 Trillion stimulus bill by the US Congress

In the past week, 25,600 Bitcoin (worth roughly $1.2 Billion) has left the crypto exchange of Coinbase. This is according to an obervation made by the team at Bloqport as seen in the following tweet.

Over the past week, 25,600 #Bitcoin ($1.2B) has left Coinbase according to veiwbase pic.twitter.com/8j82UHnk1b — Bloqport (@Bloqport) February 27, 2021

Institutions Continue to Scoop up Bitcoin

Such a massive amount of Bitcoin leaving Coinbase will most likely end up in the cold storage of one of the several institutions scooping up BTC and adding it to their company’s balance sheets.

The CEO of CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, captured one outflow of 13k Bitcoins from Coinbase on the 25th of this month and shared his observation through the following statement and chart.

13k $BTC flowed out from Coinbase a few hours ago. It seems those BTC went to multiple Coinbase custody wallets. US institutional investors are still buying Bitcoin at the 48k price. This is the strongest bullish signal I’ve ever seen.

Passing of a $1.9T Coronavirus Stimulus Bill Could Send Bitcoin Higher

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $47,400 in an attempt to capture the $48k price area as support. The latter price area will be crucial during tomorrow’s weekly and monthly close as it will determine whether Bitcoin’s bullishness is maintained through the month of March.

However, the US Congress might have given Bitcoin another lease on life after passing the highly anticipated $1.9 Trillion COVID relief bill. The US Senate is the last hurdle for the bill to be approved. Chances are, it will sail through with minimal resistance as the Democrats control the upper house.

The new stimulus bill will provide $1,400 payments for each individual US resident with the same amount for each dependent. Therefore, the selling pressure expected during the weekly and monthly close might just be minimal with crypto traders anticipating that a majority of the funds sent to US residents, will be used to purchase crypto.","In brief An unknown wallet transferred 7,073 BTC today, worth $333 million.

Speculations include institutions moving crypto to cold storage, OTC trades or internal transfers.

An anonymous whale just shifted over 7,000 Bitcoin—worth nearly $333 million at Bitcoin’s current price—to an unknown wallet, according to blockchain tracker Whale Alert.

🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 7,073 #BTC (337,807,244 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet Tx: https://t.co/ZZnwD9clqP — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) February 27, 2021

The whale—a term used to denote owners of massive amounts of bitcoins—made the transaction at 01:53 UTC this morning from an unknown wallet to another unknown wallet. Before the transaction, the whale was the 241st largest Bitcoin wallet.

Since the identity of the whale is unknown, it’s difficult to determine why they moved the Bitcoin. Speculations for whale transfers include institutions moving crypto to cold storage, huge OTC trades or internal transfers between exchange wallets. But speculations are speculations; the whale’s identity remains mysterious for now.

Bearish blues

There have been other whale movements this week as bearish blues continue to hit the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s price went from its all-time high of $58,000 last Sunday to today’s $47,000; its lowest point this week was $45,230 on February 26.

On Thursday, $400 million worth of Bitcoin (8,000) was sent from an unidentified whale—the 215th largest wallet at the time of the transfer—to a wallet that Whale Alert claimed to be linked with Coinbase, the crypto exchange giant.

But according to a record on Bit Info Charts, a wallet explorer, the receiver wallet is owned by BetVIP, not Coinbase. BetVIP.com was a Bitcoin-only sportsbook licensed in the island country of Curaçao—the company went out of business in 2015, one year after its establishment, citing “restrictive legal environment” and “lack of viable revenue.” Betvip.net, an operational sportsbook, is unrelated.

Revival of whale fossils

This year, several ancient Bitcoin whales have come out of a decade-long hibernation.

On February 24, a hundred Bitcoin that remained dormant since June 2010 moved for the first time, sparking much curiosity. The owners of wallets this old are often presumed to know or be in some ways associated with Satoshi Nakatomo, Bitcoin’s mysterious creator.

That move was first picked by Antoine Le Calvez, the self-described “Indiana Jones of the cryptosphere” who tweeted, “no, it's probably not Satoshi.”

Some old coins moved today (100 BTC from June 2010). It's very rare to see pre-GPU era bitcoins move, it only happened dozens of times in the past few years. And no, it's probably not Satoshi. pic.twitter.com/0jZXnmWUes — Antoine Le Calvez (@khannib) February 24, 2021

Last weekend, ancient whales moved 5 Bitcoin. The first significant ancient whale sighting this month was on February 9 when they moved 30 BTC.

Whale movements can sometimes shake markets, as it did back this past December when Bitcoin’s price surpassed $20,000. This is because those old coins, untouched for over a decade, introduce new money into the Bitcoin market. If a whale dumps those coins, then Bitcoin’s price could crash.

But this time, the bearish sentiments that started at the beginning of this week continue to linger—unfazed by Bitcoin whales shaking out their dusty pockets.","Why did this happen?

(Bloomberg) -- The surprise takeover bid for Toshiba Corp. is a palpable demonstration of the growing influence in corporate Japan of activist investors, who have gone from largely impotent onlookers to kingmakers in the space of just a few years.The offer from CVC Capital Partners, while still in the early stages, comes just weeks after Toshiba Chief Executive Officer Nobuaki Kurumatani lost a landmark shareholder vote, forcing an independent investigation into alleged issues with voting at its annual general meeting last year.That loss has piled pressure on Kurumatani, who barely won re-election at last year’s meeting and is seen as unlikely to survive another. The vote was triggered by Toshiba’s largest shareholder, the secretive Singapore-based hedge fund Effissimo Capital Management.Any deal for Toshiba faces legal hurdles, and analysts say that investors such as Effissimo would likely insist on a substantial premium from Tuesday’s closing price. But the episode shows that the influence of activism in Japan is becoming hard to deny.“There have been false dawns before,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “But activism is taking hold now.”Flexing MusclesCVC offered about 5,000 yen per share in its buyout proposal, according to a Toshiba executive. A bid at that level would value Toshiba at about 2.28 trillion yen ($20.7 billion) and represent a 31% premium to its last close before news of the bid emerged, data compiled by Bloomberg show.That would make it the largest private equity-led buyout since 2013, and CVC’s biggest acquisition on record. Toshiba’s board plans to form a special committee to consider the proposal, said the executive, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.While there are many hurdles to a deal taking place, Toshiba shares rose by their daily limit of 18% to 4,530 yen per share at the close in Tokyo.“Considerable value would be created simply by simplifying ownership and clarifying governance by taking the company private,” said Nicholas Benes, an expert on Japanese corporate governance. “Precisely because of that, one would very much hope that this is a case where Toshiba will be open to other bids, by both other PE firms as well as strategic acquirers.”Activist investors have increasingly been flexing their muscle in Japan in recent years, as corporate governance reforms promoting shareholder value have meant management can no longer dismiss such pressure. Tokyo Dome Corp. will be delisted this month after acquisition by a white knight last year to fend off pressure from activist investor Oasis Management Co.Once a storied name in Japan, Toshiba has faded dramatically since its glory days after years of management missteps and scandal. The conglomerate invented flash memory three decades ago, but it was forced to sell most of its prized chip business in 2018 because of losses in its nuclear-power operation. That deal led to an infusion of cash -- but also a large contingent of more vocal shareholders. Last week, Singapore fund 3D Investment Partners became the latest investor to say it may make make proposals to management, boosting its stake to more than 7%.“Any successes of this nature will probably snowball and lead to more activity,” said Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “There is a sense that a large part of Japan’s industrial base is being run inefficiently, resulting in apparent undervaluation of Japanese conglomerates.”Kioxia OptionsOne open question for Toshiba is the future of Kioxia Holdings Corp., its former memory-chip division in which its still holds the biggest stake. Kioxia is focused on going public as soon as this summer in an IPO that could value the business at more than $36 billion, Bloomberg News reported last week. Alternatively, Micron Technology Inc. and Western Digital Corp. are each to be interested in acquiring the firm, the Wall Street Journal reported.If Toshiba secures a reasonable market valuation for Kioxia, and its core businesses attract multiples similar to those of its Japan peers, Thong said he sees scope for over 1 trillion yen of shareholder value creation. That would imply a Toshiba share price of over 6,500 yen per share, while the deal reported by the Nikkei sets the price at about 5,000 yen apiece.Mio Kato of LightStream Research sees a low possibility of the deal going through under current terms, and expects volatile trading for Toshiba’s shares in the near term depending on how things develop. Toshiba’s shareholders, especially activists, will want a rather “steep price,” he wrote in a note published on SmartKarma.Given the sensitivity around several of Toshiba’s bushinesses, including its deep involvement in decommissioning the wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, government approval would be required for the deal, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Wednesday.It’s unclear if a foreign firm such as CVC would be allowed to take control of Toshiba. The relationship between CVC and Toshiba executives -- with Kurumatani a former Japan president and external director Yoshiaki Fujimori still employed by the firm -- has also raised eyebrows.“This could simply be an attempt to buy time for Kurumatani,” Kato said.(Updates with details of bid level from sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Why did this happen?

The cryptocurrency market has attracted mainstream attention over the past year, as institutional investors and corporations have started to invest in the asset class. Their involvement helped launch the cryptocurrency market cap past $1 trillion in January. The crypto market cap would eventually peak north of $1.7 trillion in February before experiencing a pullback. At current values, the digital asset class is worth over $1.4 trillion.

Both retail adoption and institutional interest has been growing rapidly over the last three months.

Bitcoin’s SOPR indicator has seen a full reset, turning negative for the first time in 5 months

The indicator points to a possible local bottom for Bitcoin

The last time it fell this low, Bitcoin went from $33,400 to $57,400

The crypto fear and greed index has fallen to levels last seen in late January when Bitcoin fell to $30k then went on to post a new all-time high above $58k

Bitcoin’s weekly/monthly close is the final bearish hurdle for BTC

Bitcoin’s SOPR indicator has experienced a full rest and turned negative for the first time in five months. This is according to data shared by the team at Glassnode who also pointed out that the SOPR indicator going negative means that investors are on average moving BTC at a loss. Below is the full statement by the team at Glassnode and a chart demonstrating the drop in the SOPR.

The daily #Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has seen a full reset, and turned negative for the first time in five months – investors were on average moving BTC at a slight loss, indicating profit-taking has abated.

Bitcoin’s SOPR Hints of a Possible Bottom for Bitcoin

The SOPR, or Spent Output Profit Ratio, ‘represents the profit ratio of coins moved on-chain, measured through the variation between purchase price and sale price’. A SOPR value greater than 1 means that investors are selling at a profit. When the SOPR goes below 1 as is the case right now with Bitcoin, investors are selling at a loss.

The team at Bloqport has seen the recent drop in the SOPR as a hint that Bitcoin has bottomed at least for the short term. According to Bloqport, such a reset last happened when Bitcoin went from $33,400 to $57,400. Furthermore, funding rates have also cooled off thus providing the ideal environment for another leg up for Bitcoin.

Crypto Fear and Greed Index Falls to Levels Last Seen in Late January

In addition to the SOPR experiencing a rest, the Crypto fear and Greed index has dropped to 55 after plateauing above 90 for the better part of February. An index value of 55 was last witnessed in late January when Bitcoin bottomed at $30k. The local bottom at $30k set the pace for Bitcoin to post a new all-time high of $58,389 – Binance rate – on the 21st of February.

Therefore, chances of a local bottom are high for Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin has one last bearish hurdle for the month of February in the form of the weekly and monthly close only a few hours away. This event could provide additional selling pressure that could ultimately break Bitcoin’s $44k support and send it lower to the $42k support zone.","FILE PHOTO: Representation of the virtual currency Bitcoin is seen on a motherboard in this picture illustration taken April 24, 2020.

While some major details are still missing (most notably when the company plans to list), we now have a glimpse into how a major crypto exchange works, what it’s worried about and just how much the market is growing.

The figures are indeed eye-opening: In the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of verified users on Coinbase’s platform reached 43 million after adding almost 45,000 new users a day. The average number of monthly transacting users grew by over 30% in the fourth quarter alone, to 2.8 million.

The Coinbase filing gave everyone who works in this industry something to chew on. There was the bold vision, the numbers, the services overview and some details on their recent acquisitions. There was even a nod to Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who was featured on the front page as a designated recipient of copies of the filing documents.

And for those interested in the future of work, the customary physical location of the filer was given as “Address not applicable,” with the footnote: “In May 2020, we became a remote-first company. Accordingly, we do not maintain a headquarters.”

While there is much to enjoy in the filing, and no doubt much to continue to pick apart over the next few days, let’s take a step back and look at what this document is really about, and what it says about the future of capital markets. Deep down, it’s about the reshaping of trust.

Opening the books

One of the big steps forward for the industry is greater transparency as to the inner workings of a key infrastructure company.

With greater transparency comes greater trust. This is not the same as trust that Coinbase’s value will go up and up. It’s trust that there is a real business opportunity here, for investors and builders.

We’ve all experienced the dismissal from mainstream economists and investors that crypto is anything but hot air. We’ve all seen how market innovations are dismissed as trivial or even irritating. Yet with this hefty document, even the most skeptical of market observers will look at the numbers and realize that this business is substantial, and that crypto assets move significant amounts of money. What’s more, the market is attracting a growing user base that is generating meaningful profit margins.

With this filing, more traditional businesses will start to trust that crypto assets are here to stay, and are a market force to be reckoned with.

Sharing concerns

The filing also lists in detail the potential risks to Coinbase and to the industry as a whole. Any therapist will tell you that sharing your worries helps to diminish them. In finance, disclosing every risk you can think of makes good regulatory sense; it also helps them to seem more containable.

The risks listed by Coinbase include the usual caveats about the sensitivity of Coinbase’s income to the volatile nature of crypto markets, the possibility of cyberattacks and the threat of adverse regulation. It also includes some less talked about risks such as the possibility of class-action lawsuits, the loss of banking relationships and the reemergence of Satoshi Nakamoto in person.

Airing in public everything we think could go wrong in our industry will assuage mainstream concern that we’re blind to the dangers of untested technologies, new financial instruments and the lure of the quick profit. It broadcasts that we know, and yet we still believe that these markets are necessary.

It boosts trust in our industry and in the overall integrity of the main market participants.

Market power

The reshaping of trust is also obvious in Coinbase’s decision to use the direct listing approach. This bypasses much of the IPO rigmarole, in that the company lists by selling already existing shares on the market. This means that there is no need for a roadshow to drum up institutional interest, no expensive fees to underwriters, no shareholder dilution.

It is also appropriate for a company steeped in a decentralized ethos, even if it runs a centralized business. In an initial public offering (IPO), the initial trading price is decided on by a group of investment bankers who balance declared institutional interest with the company’s desire to get the highest price possible (and the advisers’ fondness for higher fees). In a direct listing, the market decides.

It is almost a pity, though, that Coinbase chose to forgo the crypto education opportunity that a roadshow to institutions would have offered. Just imagine the investment committees of mutual funds, pension funds, etc., getting a masterclass in crypto assets and their markets.

A further effect of Coinbase’s direct listing decision is the message it sends to other businesses in the industry also contemplating taking advantage of soaring prices and volumes. Investment banks are no doubt already fielding a flood of incoming requests for meetings, and the next few months will most likely see other well-known crypto companies, and probably even some more obscure ones, follow a similar path.

More companies making public their accounts will lead to even greater industry understanding, which enhances trust.

Phase 2

Zooming out even further, the Coinbase move delineates where we are in the arc of crypto impact on capital markets.

Those of us who work in the crypto industry have been saying for some time that crypto markets will influence traditional markets more than most currently realize.

What’s becoming clearer now is that it will happen in phases. Right now, we’re in the assets phase, where the value propositions and price potential of cryptocurrencies and tokens dominate the mindshare of traditional market participants. Companies that help investors onboard and manage their crypto holdings have center stage. We will also see traditional players tiptoe into the crypto pool to harness some of the attention-grabbing action for their clients.

This first phase is about the assets themselves, and facilitating access to them.

The next phase will be how assets move.

Coinbase hints at this in the S-1 document when it discusses traditional assets that move on blockchains. Included in the outlines growth strategy is: “Tokenize new assets.” The section goes on: “We will invest in infrastructure and regulatory clarity to pave a path for the digitization of more traditional financial assets to help pave the path for new assets to be represented as crypto assets.”

It is worth remembering that Coinbase has participated in the funding rounds of several startups building security token infrastructure.

Some had hoped that Coinbase would set an example and come to market via a security token. Progress is being made, but the security token market is still too illiquid and immature to support such an ambitious step. Interest is building, however, supported by recent market events that have laid bare the inefficiencies of current capital market plumbing.

And Coinbase did bury deep in the S-1 text a hint that it might consider issuing blockchain tokens in the future, with the following statement: “We may issue shares of capital stock, including in the form of blockchain tokens, to our customers in connection with customer reward or loyalty programs.”

That is yet another way in which the Coinbase listing is about trust. The eventual migration of capital markets to blockchain-based systems, nudged along by the issuance of new security-like assets as well as tokenized securities, could push trust in capital markets back to a healthy level.

With its S-1 filing, Coinbase is not just pushing for a new type of trust in crypto markets. It is possibly also setting the stage for a new type of trust in capital markets more broadly. This is a mammoth ambition, but one that both crypto market practitioners and capital markets observers can get behind.

Payments giant Square has purchased an additional 3,318 BTC for $170 million, bringing its holding up to 8,027 BTC. It also revealed that its allocation of 4,709 BTC to its treasury holdings in October 2020 cost about $50 million. That holding is now worth over $250 million. TAKEAWAY: This highlights the complex issues surrounding treasury allocations to bitcoin, a growing trend among innovative companies worried about the impact of fiat debasement. Should treasury holdings be a speculative bet? What happens when the value appreciation exceeds the company’s revenue? How should this be reflected in accounting? Interesting to note that RBC increased its price target for Square for 2021, in part due to a 69% jump in 2021 bitcoin revenue.

Square wasn’t the only company adding to its BTC holdings this week. MicroStrategy revealed the purchase of another 19,452 BTC for $1.026 billion in bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: Funds for this purchase came from a $1.05 billion convertible debt offering, and have leverage the firm even more to the BTC price.

Asset manager CoinShares has launched a physically backed Ethereum ETP on the Swiss SIX exchange with the ticker “ETHE.” TAKEAWAY: Following on the heels of CoinShares’ bitcoin ETP launch in January, this underscores the growing investor interest in ETH.

Crypto asset manager CoinShares also released the CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index Lite (CGI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) token designed for institutional investors. The token’s value is based on two equally weighted “wrapped” crypto assets – wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and wrapped ether (WETH) – and the firm’s wrapped gold token, wDGLD. TAKEAWAY: If you read last week’s newsletter, you’ll know that I think institutional interest in DeFi is worth watching. This token makes that even easier, not only because it can be tracked, but also because it provides a relatively convenient on-ramp for investors considering exposure. This is not really tracking “hard core” DeFi innovation, but it’s a start.

CI Global Asset Management, a subsidiary of a firm overseeing more than $230 billion in assets, filed a preliminary prospectus for CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCX), which, if approved, would be Canada’s third bitcoin ETF. TAKEAWAY: Given the strong demand for the Purpose Bitcoin ETF in its early days of trading (when the BTC price wasn’t falling), this is possibly just the beginning of a stream of ETFs listed on Canadian stock exchanges. As the bitcoin ETF market starts to get populated in Canada, we could also start to see some more diverse approaches, such as offering investors exposure to a basket of assets.

A February survey of 30,000 people over the age of 18 conducted by Piplsay, a global consumer research platform, found that 25% of Americans surveyed hold crypto assets, with a further 27% saying that they plan to invest this year. TAKEAWAY: These results are in line with similar surveys carried out recently by Grayscale Investments (a subsidiary of DCG, also parent of CoinDesk) and Bitwise, and underscore the receding likelihood that the U.S. government would attempt to ban bitcoin. Rather, the more extensive the mainstream interest in bitcoin, the more regulated services will step in to service this market, and the more comfortable regulators will get with pending issues.

During the market sell-off on Monday, ETH traded as low as $700 (a more than 50% drop) on crypto exchange Kraken. TAKEAWAY: This highlights that, even though market liquidity has improved dramatically over the years, there could still be issues of order books drying up in the face of high volume and uncertainty.

Related Stories","A crypto investment firm with $1 billion in assets under management is selling Bitcoin to boost its position in two of the largest altcoins by market cap.

Managing director Prakash Chand of the Dubai-based firm FD7 Ventures says Bitcoin may have achieved a first-mover position as a digital store of value.

However, he believes other projects are set to surpass the leading cryptocurrency in size and utility.

“Aside from the fact that Bitcoin was first to market and society has given it meaning as a store of value, I think Bitcoin is actually pretty useless.”

Chand says the firm intends to sell $750 million in Bitcoin in order to increase its exposure to Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT), which he believes are the foundation of the new internet and Web 3.0.

He also cites Ethereum as a crypto asset that could supersede Bitcoin in the years ahead.

“I’ve been lucky enough to spend lots time with the brightest minds in crypto and I’m willing to bet that each of Ethereum, Cardano and Polkadot will be more valuable than Bitcoin within the next few years.”

FD7 Ventures says it has already started selling its Bitcoin position and expects to finish the conversion to Cardano and Polkadot by the end of March.

Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, has begun investing in bitcoin. Having previously called the cryptocurrency “garbage,” he has now changed his mind and believes that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. He is also getting used to the volatility of bitcoin and believes that institutional investors are willing to hold through price fluctuations.

Kevin O’Leary Now a Bitcoin Believer

Canadian investor and television personality Kevin O’Leary has changed his mind about bitcoin. He previously called the cryptocurrency “garbage” and a “giant nothing burger,” but now he has invested in bitcoin and thinks that it is no longer a fad.

“I actually think that digital currencies are here to stay,” he said in an interview with CNBC last week. “Most people that are willing to hold them, including institutions over the last 90 days, are willing to deal with the volatility.” O’Leary elaborated:

I am fascinated. I’m investing. I’m holding a 3% weighting in it between ethereum and bitcoin. The volatility sickens me but I’m getting used to it.

“And, finally, I’m starting to think about how do I invest in the infrastructure of mining bitcoin,” Mr. Wonderful added.

Commenting on bitcoin’s volatility, O’Leary shared: “Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the main decision you have to make after you decide to participate in the first place is what % of your portfolio do you allocate. For me, 5% is the maximum.”

Morgan Creek Digital partner Anthony Pompliano, who had been trying to convince O’Leary to invest in BTC for years, responded to the Shark Tank star’s 5% allocation statement. “You forbid me to have 50% and you called it all ‘garbage,’ but now you think 5% is acceptable. Eventually, you will be 50% yourself.”

O’Leary replied, “Correct, I change when facts change.” He emphasized:

Canadian, Swiss and many other regulators have done a 180% on BTC. This is a game changer for many investors including me.

O’Leary had always been worried about regulators coming down hard on bitcoin. In December, he warned that “Grown men are going to weep when that happens. You will never see a loss of capital like that ever in your life. It will be brutal.” Nonetheless, he said that if a bitcoin ETF is approved, he would be willing to put 5% of his portfolio in it. Recently, Canada’s securities regulator approved two bitcoin ETFs.

Do you think Kevin O’Leary will keep putting more money in bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

Your options grow even more limited if you want cryptocurrency exposure in an IRA account. There are now two publicly traded trusts that offer investors a way into their stash of Bitcoin tokens, but Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) and Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OTC:OBTC) are polar opposites in just about every sense.

One packs an annual management fee that is four times greater than the other, but the other trades at a ludicrous premium to its net assets. Which one is right for you? Let's take a closer look, including -- of course -- the option of just buying Bitcoin tokens directly.

Bit by Bitcoin

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has been around since 2013. It went public in 2015. It's huge, with $30.7 billion in assets under management. The biggest knock on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is that it charges 2% a year in management fees, and like mutual funds it is taken out gradually over the course of the year. It's a stiff cover charge, but we'll get to that issue shortly.

Osprey Bitcoin Trust is the shiny new toy for Bitcoin bulls and bears looking for a stock exchange-listed vehicle. It hit the market earlier this month. It has just $77 million in assets under management, so it's tiny. The biggest selling point on Osprey Bitcoin Trust is that it charges just 0.49% in annual fees. With all things being equal it would be easy to choose the newish Osprey trust over Grayscale's groundbreaking platform, but that's not the case. It's not even close.

When Grayscale Bitcoin Trust hit the stock market it was a feeding frenzy. By the end of May in 2015 it was trading at a 137% premium to its actual Bitcoin stake. We're not talking about a 37% mark-up on a baseline of 100% for Bitcoin. We're saying that investors were willing to pay more than double what it was actually worth. It was harder to buy cryptocurrency four years ago, and there were plenty of horror stories about wallet security. The climate is kinder now, and so is the premium on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

Grayscale's mark-up has fluctuated between 6% and 38% since 2019 -- until last week. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust began last week fetching an 8% premium to the Bitcoin it tracks. During the week's wild trading there were moments when it traded at a slight discount. By the time the closing bell sounded on Friday, Grayscale's trust was at a rare 1.4% discount to its corresponding Bitcoin assets.

Osprey's flying too high right now

Osprey Bitcoin Trust is still in the honeymoon phase with investors, and that's dangerous. If Grayscale seemed outrageous at a 137% premium when there were no other stock exchange-listed alternatives why is Osprey commanding a 152% premium? It closed out the week at nearly $40 with a net asset value of $15.87. The trust actually moved higher last week despite Bitcoin itself taking a big hit.

With just $77 million assets under management the trading will be volatile. Scarcity will make this a bucking bronco. However, given the choice between Grayscale and Osprey right now is there even truly a choice? Yes, there's a 151 basis point difference in the management fees between the two but it would take roughly a century of ownership to justify paying a 152% premium for Osprey with Grayscale at a slight discount.

$GBTC vs. $OBTC

GBTC:

Price: $43.20

NAV: $43.81 (1.4% discount)

Annual Fee: 2%

AUM: $30.7 billion



OBTC:

Price: $39.92

NAV: $15.87 (152% premium)

Annual Fee: 0.49%

AUM: $77 million



If you're looking at the lower fee and NOT the premium you're doing it wrong. #Bitcoin — Rick Munarriz (@Market) February 27, 2021

You can also own Bitcoin directly, and a growing number of fintech platforms are making it easier than ever. If you plan on holding Bitcoin for at least a couple of years it would make sense to just buy in directly. However, if you're not sure how long you want to be in crypto -- and you have an itchy trigger finger -- keep in mind that all of the best-known trading platforms including Coinbase, PayPal, and Cash app charge a minimum of 1.5% to 2% on purchases and also the sales. If you think you'll be in and out within 18 months that's the kind of speculation that can cost you more in fees than it would buying Grayscale at a broker that offers zero commission trading and seeing 2% a year erode gradually.

Buying Bitcoin directly is the best approach for long-term investors that have done their research, accepting the risks that come with buying into crypto. However, if your choice is down to Grayscale or Osprey as the two available stock exchange-listed trusts Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the obvious call.

2021-03-01,"The past week was not kind to top-ranking cryptocurrencies, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum suffered strong corrections. However, the situation might be finally turning for the better, although nothing is certain as of yet

Bitcoin price bounces back up after approaching $43,000

Bitcoin saw a choppy end to the last week of February, with price falling from $58k to $45k in just a day and a half — which was a massive drop of 22% of its value.

Following the crash, the coin’s price saw a recovery as the last week of February started and the coin returned to an average price of $50,000 per unit.

Over the course of the week, however, BTC saw another drop, this time on Thursday. Right after the coin’s price surged to $52,162, according to CEX.IO, the price crashed to $47,789, This drop was not as great as the previous one, but still had a significant impact on the market.

The price saw a bit of a correction to $47,798 on Friday, only to drop to $47k once again over the weekend, albeit a bit more gradually. At the time of writing, the price is once again growing, potentially recovering from the late February drops.

Ethereum price slips back to $1,300

While large Bitcoin corrections are unfortunate, people have mostly gotten used to them as they do happen all the time. The coin crashes, then skyrockets again — it’s all very typical for BTC. However, Ethereum has suffered great losses over the last 10 days, and while the asset is volatile, it is not usually this volatile.

In the last 10 days, ETH went from $2,000 to $1,593. Then, it recovered to $1,700, only to go through a series of price drops in the second half of last week, and end up at $1,378, according to CEX.IO. It is not over yet, however, as Ethereum — just like Bitcoin — started seeing something of a recovery over the last few hours, as it climbed to $1,458.

As far as fundamental reasons go, there was nothing much that happened with Ethereum specifically to have it go through such a behaviour, so the current losses are likely in correlation with BTC. The two coins’ charts are fairly similar, indicating that Bitcoin is still dictating the entire market’s behavior.

Where are BTC and ETH going from here?

Earlier, we predicted that BTC will end Q1 with a price of $50k per coin, while Ethereum will be at $1,300. The coins outperformed and surpassed these levels far sooner than expected, but this still doesn’t mean that my forecast will not be correct. Indeed, as we have seen over the past week, a few days is all it takes for the coins to slip and drop from major heights.

If the crypto industry has shown anything over the years — it’s the fact that it is quite tenacious. My original forecast appears to be still standing, for Q1 at least, and so do the ones for Q2 and the end of the year. We expect BTC to be at $80,000 by the end of June, and $90,000 by the end of 2021.

As for ETH, we expect it to hit $2,200 by the end of Q2, thus returning to its current ATH. As for the end of the year, the coin could skyrocket more than double from the Q1 prediction, likely ending 2021 at $4,900 or somewhere in this neighbourhood.","LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has restarted its cryptocurrency trading desk and will begin dealing bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards for clients from next week, a person familiar with the matter said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

The team will sit within the U.S. bank’s Global Markets division, the person said.

The desk is part of Goldman’s activities within the fast-growing digital assets sector, which also includes projects involving blockchain technology and central bank digital currencies, the person said.

As part of this work, the bank is also exploring the potential for a bitcoin exchange traded fund and has issued a request for information to explore digital asset custody, the source said.

The trading desk reboot comes amid growing interest by institutions in bitcoin, which has soared more than 470% over the past year. The largest cryptocurrency is seen by investors and some companies as a hedge against inflation as governments and central banks turn on the stimulus taps.

While its price has risen significantly over the past year, bitcoin remains highly volatile. The virtual currency smashed through $58,000 on February 21 then fell back by as much as 25% but has recovered some lost ground.

This makes the coin and related derivatives attractive for investors willing to take riskier long or short positions as they hunt for yield in a record-low interest rate environment.

Non-deliverable forwards are a type of derivative that allows investors to take a view on bitcoin’s future price.

Goldman first set up a cryptocurrency desk in 2018, just as bitcoin’s price was falling from record highs, muting investor interest in digital coins.

Since then, market infrastructure for bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies has significantly matured, with many established financial institutions offering products and services, including CME Group Inc, Intercontinental Exchange Inc and Fidelity.

The developments have helped to attract more mainstream companies to the sector, ranging from those offering crypto services to retail or institutional investors, to companies opting to hold bitcoin on their balance sheets

Last month, electric car manufacturer Tesla Inc said it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, while Bank of New York Mellon Corp said it had formed a new unit to help clients hold and transfer digital assets.","Why did this happen?

The autonomous region, a favorite among the industry because of its cheap power, also banned new digital coin projects, according to a draft plan posted on the Inner Mongolia Development and Reform Commission’s website Feb. 25. The aim is to constrain growth in energy consumption to about 1.9% in 2021.

The announcement unnerved an industry that’s already been through a years-long Chinese campaign to shrink it down amid concerns over speculative bubbles, fraud and energy waste. The draft policy was released weeks after the National Development and Reform Commission -- China’s top economic planner -- blasted Inner Mongolia for being the only province to fail to control energy consumption in 2019.

The region now aims to cut emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 3% this year and control incremental growth of energy consumption at about 5 million tons of standard coal, according to the draft plan.

Chinese officials first outlined proposals in 2018 to discourage crypto-mining -- the computing process that makes transactions with virtual currencies possible but consumes vast amounts of power.

Inner Mongolia, which is clustered with large coal mines, is famous for inexpensive energy and has attracted investment from a plethora of power-intensive sectors such as aluminum and ferro-alloy smelting over past decades. The region accounted for 8% of global Bitcoin mining computing power, according to the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index compiled by Cambridge University. China overall had over 65% of the network’s total, with its appealing combination of inexpensive electricity, local chipmaking factories and cheap labor.

The local crackdown is reviving old fears. Beijing since 2017 has abolished initial coin offerings and clamped down on virtual currency trading within its borders, forcing many exchanges overseas. The country was once home to about 90% of trades but the lion’s share of mining, but major players like Bitmain Technologies Ltd. have since fled abroad.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Nvidia Corp. are among listed chipmakers that supply crypto miners in China and around the world.

Bitcoin surged as much as 9% on Monday after its worst weekly performance since March 2020 last week.

The cryptocurrency rose after a bullish report from Citi that said bitcoin could be at the start of a ""massive transformation"" into the mainstream of finance.

The price of bitcoin also jumped amid news that China's Inner Mongolia will ban all cryptocurrency mining activities by April 2021.

The price of bitcoin surged as much as 9% on Monday after logging its worst weekly performance since March 2020 last week. The move higher follows an upbeat note from Citi and news of a ban on cryptocurrency mining in China's Inner Mongolia region.

""Bitcoin seems to have bounced back today as cryptocurrency markets start the week in a resurgent mood,"" said Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange. ""The backdrop of huge pent-up institutional demand and interest from long-term investors may be here to say, but time will tell.""

As of 1:45 p.m. ET, bitcoin was trading higher by 7.3%, at $48,540.14.

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose after a bullish report from Citigroup's Global Perspectives & Solution that said bitcoin could be at the start of a ""massive transformation"" into the mainstream of finance. The 108-page report also floated the prospect that bitcoin could become the currency of global trade.

""There are a host of risks and obstacles that stand in the way of bitcoin progress,"" the report said. ""But weighing these potential hurdles against the opportunities leads to the conclusion that bitcoin is at a tipping point and we could be at the start of massive transformation of cryptocurrency into the mainstream.""

The price of bitcoin also jumped on news that China's Inner Mongolia will ban all cryptocurrency mining activities by April, Reuters first reported, amid efforts to curb high energy-use projects, according to a draft plan posted on the Inner Mongolia Development and Reform Commission's site on February 25.

Cryptocurrency mining, particularly, bitcoin, is known to be highly energy intensive, with some reports suggesting that it uses more electricity each year than some whole countries, including Argentina and Ukraine.

The autonomous region, now one of China's top two coal-mining regions, was the only one among 30 areas under Beijing's energy consumption and energy intensity review that did not meet its targets in 2019.

Inner Mongolia, a major energy consumer known for its low electricity prices, is working towards limiting the growth of energy consumption to around five million tons of standard coal in 2021 and plans to cut emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 3% compared to 2020.

""[Inner Mongolia] will tighten its energy control measures and bear the targets throughout all economic and social aspects,"" the draft rule said.

The region accounted for 8% of bitcoin mining computing power worldwide, Bloomberg reported, according to Cambridge University's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. China overall, meanwhile, accounted for 65% of the total.

Gary Gensler, nominee for SEC chairman and former head of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, says, if confirmed, he will work with fellow commissioners to make sure concerns about crypto are addressed.

“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have brought new thinking to payments and financial inclusion, but they've also raised new issues of investor protection that we still need to attend to,” said Gensler, nominee to head the SEC.

BITCOIN BUYERS PUNISHED BY SURGING BOND YIELDS

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has seen its market value this year soar by 69% to $925.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com, as Wall Street and corporate America have more widely adapted cryptocurrency investing. The global crypto market cap is $1.47 trillion.

If bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were deemed to be securities, they would fall under the purview of the SEC. Exchanges that facilitate the trading of such cryptocurrencies would also need to have the appropriate investor protections in place, he said.

HIGHLIGHTS: BIDEN'S SEC PICK GENSLER FACES CONGRESS

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are currently considered to be commodities and regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.

Because cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the SEC, there is no clarity about how publicly traded companies that have invested in digital assets should treat them on their financial statements. Accounting standards for such investments are becoming more important as a number of public companies have recently begun investing in bitcoin.

Other companies, like Tesla Inc. and Square Inc., have followed MicroStrategy’s lead, allocating less than 10% of their cash to the cryptocurrency.

Gensler doesn’t just view digital currencies as investment vehicles but believes they also provide useful technologies.

He told Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a Republican, that blockchain technology, which underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has been a “catalyst for change” in the world of finance.

A combination of factors could have spooked some cryptocurrency traders, leading to last week’s 21% sell-off, the biggest for a seven-day stretch since March 2020.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s (GBTC) premium to its underlying asset flipped negative for the first time in years last week shortly before the market dipped, potentially signaling investors exiting the market.

Goldman Sachs announced plans to restart its cryptocurrency trading desk, which some traders speculated could be bearish for the market simply because of the timing of Goldman’s initial launch of the desk at the market’s peak in 2017.

Leading stablecoin issuer Tether was threatened with a 500 BTC ransom note to be paid to prevent the public release of supposed documents between Tether and its bank, Deltec.

But there’s also been a steady stream of bullish news:

Cboe BZX Exchange filed to list shares of VanEck’s bitcoin ETF, kicking off the regulatory review process for an exchange-traded fund listing in the US.

Goldman Sachs restarting its cryptocurrency trading desk is not bullish to many traders who see it as merely another indicator that more institutional traders and investors are showing interest in digital asset markets.

Corporate buyers aren’t finished investing either, with bitcoin-laden MicroStrategy topping off its latest $1 billion investment with another $15 million purchase.

Citigroup released a 108-page report about the cryptocurrency industry in which it said bitcoin is at a “tipping point” amid surging retail and institutional interest.

PayPal is said to be in talks to acquire Curv, a cryptocurrency custody business, in a move that could position the payments giant to dive further into the crypto market.

Large bitcoin outflows from Coinbase continue. Another 12,000 BTC left Coinbase on Tuesday. Although there are many blind spots in Bitcoin blockchain data, these large outflows have recently coincided with investments from institutional or corporate investors.

Speaking to Cboe’s filing, EQUOS head of sales and trading Matt Blom told CoinDesk, “This by no means ensures the floodgates will open, but it is a huge step towards allowing the investing public easy access to the performance of our favorite asset.” As regulators consider the listing, “there will be a long line of competitors to the VanEck bitcoin ETF hoping that the winds of change are officially here,” Blom said.

The bottom line: The market is quiet as it struggles to find direction. Bitcoin has gained 60% year to date. Ether (ETH) has doubled over the same period but today the crypto is down -3.87%.

(Bloomberg) -- In an era of prosperity for investment banks, Credit Suisse Group AG is careening from one crisis to another and then another -- this time, with a $4.7 billion writedown tied to billionaire investor Bill Hwang’s trading blowout.The staggering hit -- the largest yet linked to market-shaking losses run up by Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management -- prompted sweeping management changes at the Swiss bank Tuesday and cast fresh doubt on its checkered record of managing risks. It caps a catalog of costly errors at Credit Suisse -- most recently the collapse of Greensill Capital -- in what was supposed to be the start of steadier era under Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gottstein.At a moment when investment banks are feasting on market activity and dealmaking, Credit Suisse is under mounting pressure to persuade shareholders and clients it can put its house in order and remain a vital, independent force in global banking. After the firm announced plans to cut its dividend and suspend share buybacks, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut their recommendation for the stock, which already was breaking with peers in tumbling this year.“The ongoing negative newsflow could have an impact on the remainder” of Credit Suisse’s businesses, analysts Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan wrote in a note, lowering their rating to neutral from overweight. “Besides the impact from various management changes and regulatory oversight,” they wrote, the bank “might have to pursue a strategy of ‘capital preservation’” that could restrain growth.David Herro at Harris Associates, a top shareholder of Credit Suisse, said the bank’s losses should serve as a “wakeup call” to expedite cultural change as Chairman Urs Rohner prepares to hand over to Lloyds Banking Group Plc CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio at the end of the month. Rohner has offered to forgo his compensation for 2020 of 1.5 million francs.Another long-standing backer of the bank, Qatar’s former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, stands to suffer a personal hit as well after vehicles linked to him invested about $200 million in funds Credit Suisse ran with Greensill, according to people familiar with the matter. As former head of the Qatar Investment Authority, Sheik Hamad had made Qatar one of the Swiss bank’s largest shareholders.Acknowledging the need for deep change, Credit Suisse on Tuesday replaced its investment bank head and chief risk officer, along with a handful of other executives. Gottstein, who took over in February last year after a spying scandal toppled his predecessor, told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung that the bank has no sacred cows with regard to strategy.“Serious lessons will be learned,” he pledged in a statement. The Archegos loss “is unacceptable.”While the Swiss bank wasn’t the only firm that helped Hwang’s family office lever up large positions in a relatively small slate of stocks, rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG managed to unwind their exposures quickly with minimal damage.Credit Suisse has now offloaded the bulk of its Archegos exposure, helped by a $2.3 billion sale this week. But the impact of that latest disposal and any remaining positions could affect second-quarter results, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The dual hits from Archegos and Greensill have put the bank on track for its second straight quarterly loss, at a time when investment banks around the world are still focused on the windfall unleashed by the market turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic. The five largest U.S. firms boosted trading revenue by more than a third last year to the highest in at least a decade.JPMorgan’s Wall Street unit generated its most fourth-quarter revenue and profit ever. Deutsche Bank is among firms that have said their investment banks are off to a strong start this year. And Jefferies Financial Group Inc. already reported an 81% jump in revenue from capital markets in the fiscal first quarter that ended Feb. 28.In an update on its underlying businesses Tuesday, Credit Suisse noted that issues such as Archegos were negating the “very strong performance that had otherwise been achieved by our investment banking businesses” as well as higher profits in wealth and asset management units.The firm is still set to give an update on the effect of last month’s collapse of Greensill Capital, which helped manage $10 billion of investment funds the Swiss bank offered to asset management clients. Credit Suisse is leaning toward letting clients take the hit of expected losses in those funds, a person familiar with the discussions said.Among the executives to leave over the missteps are investment bank head Brian Chin and risk chief Lara Warner. Gottstein previously removed Eric Varvel from his role running asset management after Greensill’s downfall. In a memo to staff Monday, Credit Suisse also announced at least five other departures, including equities trading chief Paul Galietto.Christian Meissner, the former Bank of America Corp. executive who joined Credit Suisse in October, will take over from Chin next month. Joachim Oechslin will become risk chief in the interim, a role he held until 2019 when Warner took over. Thomas Grotzer was named interim head of compliance.The bank cut its dividend proposal for 2020 to 10 centimes a share, from about 29 centimes, and suspended its share buyback until its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of capital strength, returns to the targeted level. Credit Suisse said it expects a CET1 ratio of at least 12% in the first quarter. It had aimed for at least 12.5% in the first half of this year. Top executives’ bonuses for last year have been scrapped.Credit Suisse Payout Pause Won’t Halt Archegos Fallout: ReactThe Zurich-based bank was one of several global investment banks to facilitate the leveraged bets of Archegos, and had tried to reach some sort of standstill to figure out how to unwind positions without sparking panic, people familiar with the matter have said. The strategy failed as rivals rushed to cut their losses.“Almost two weeks in, it is still not clear how the bank managed to take a 4.4 billion-franc charge for one client in the prime brokerage business, which we estimate generates less than 1 billion francs per annum in revenues,” JPMorgan’s analysts wrote.Among big banks that dealt with Archegos, only Nomura Holdings Inc. has signaled the potential to also take a multibillion-dollar hit, saying it could lose as much as $2 billion.Credit Suisse’s latest trades came more than a week after several rivals dumped their shares. The bank hit the market with block trades tied to ViacomCBS Inc., Vipshop Holdings Ltd. and Farfetch Ltd., a person with knowledge of the matter said. The stocks traded substantially below where they were last month before Hwang’s family office imploded.In addition to the Archegos writedown, Credit Suisse may need to set aside 2 billion francs over the coming years for litigation tied to Greensill, according to the JPMorgan analysts.Startup lender Greensill Capital had borrowed from the bank and helped manage a group of debt funds that were marketed as among its safest products. Now the funds are frozen and being wound down after Lex Greensill’s firm collapsed amid doubts about its lending practices.Credit Suisse said it will provide an update on the funds in the next few days.(Adds shareholder comment in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","The U.S. bank has restarted a crypto trading desk scuttled during the last bear market.

Goldman Sachs has restarted a cryptocurrency trading desk that was halted after the last major bull run of 2017, according to Reuters.

The rebooted desk will start trading cash-settled Bitcoin futures on behalf of its clients next week, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed source. Coindesk, meanwhile, reported that the Goldman service plans to resume in mid-March.

The trading desk is set to sit within the bank's Global Markets division, a market-maker that does business with hedge funds and other institutional investors such as pension plans.

Trading cash-settled futures means that the bank would not have to take custody of the underlying digital assets directly. Those types of contracts allow two parties to wager on Bitcoin's price at a specified point in the future without exchanging the cryptocurrency itself.

Goldman is also said to doing its due diligence on the possibility of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF.) Further details aren't known.

The bank is also looking at offering cryptocurrency custodial services, and has issued a ""request for information"" about it internally, according to a CoinDesk report in January. JPMorgan and Citi are said to be exploring a similar offering.

Rival investment bank BNY Mellon has already gone public with its crypto custody plans, while Deutsche Bank is following suit.

Goldman's cryptocurrency trading desk was set up in 2018, at the tail end of a cryptocurrency boom that saw Bitcoin hit the $20,000 mark in December 2017.

The US bank hired Justin Schmidt to run its digital asset markets desk in April 2018. Before joining Goldman, Schmidt worked in quantitative investment roles.

But Schmidt left the bank in 2020 as 15-year Goldman veteran Mathew McDermott took on his role. McDermott's mandate as global head of digital assets was to oversee Goldman's exploratory work with ""distributed ledgers,"" which are attempts to use the concepts behind blockchains but without permissionless cryptocurrencies attached.

Part of Goldman's work under McDermott was investigating the issuance of the bank's own digital stablecoin. Perhaps as a harbinger of the current institutionally led bull market, he told CNBC last year that he was seeing rising institutional interest in cryptocurrencies.","Why (and How) Women Should Be Exploring Cryptocurrency Right Now

It's been estimated that only 10 to 15 percent of the people currently investing in Bitcoin are female. Is this once-in-a-lifetime wealth-generating opportunity passing by a generation of women due to the preponderance of mansplaining around the topic of cryptocurrency?

Sure, when cryptocurrency arrived on the scene, it sounded like the stuff of science fiction. But Bitcoin and other digital alternatives to government-issued money are here to stay, and they're producing eye-popping gains in price as they achieve new levels of mainstream awareness and investment.

Studies have recognized that women perform as equals at, if not better than, generating returns on investments compared to their male peers. And with more people learning about the cryptocurrencies, it's crucial that women take their skillset into that space and consider these assets as part of their investment mix. Here's why—and how to do it.

What is cryptocurrency anyway?

Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, emerged in 2008 when a still-unknown figure, under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakomoto, published a now-famous white paper detailing the creation of a new form of currency not controlled by any bank or government, designed both for transactions and to serve as a store of value.

Each Bitcoin contains a million Satoshis—think cents to the dollar—and this is what investors are actually buying when they say they're ""buying Bitcoin."" These digital tokens are produced through complex math performed in a computing process called ""mining."" New Bitcoins are still being mined today, but by Nakomoto's design, only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist, and the last one will likely be created by the year 2140.

Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market share, but it actually functions as a blockchain-based computing platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications that power real-life applications, such as crowdfunding and small business loans. Lite Coin, also popular, is an ""alt-coin"" that is technically similar to Bitcoin but holds a much smaller share of the market.

Who else is on board, and why?

Institutional adoption of digital currencies, Bitcoin in particular, is growing fast. In January, Tesla converted $1.5 billion of its balance sheet into Bitcoin, and will soon start accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for vehicle sales. Other major companies making big investments in Bitcoin include the payments processor Square and the business intelligence software provider MicroStrategy.

One reason companies are exploring digital currencies is that they're proving to be a worthy store of value—both more rare and more profitable than gold itself. The reason why Bitcoin in particular has received recognition as a store of value is its finite nature, paired with growing demand that has made Bitcoin the best performing asset of the last decade.

How can I invest?

The current momentum in the cryptocurrency market is being fueled not by major corporations' moves, but by the rise of easy-to-use consumer apps that allow individuals to invest with the tap of a button.

Apps like Paypal, Cash App, Celsius, and Voyager allow users to easily invest anywhere from $5 to $50,000 in not just Bitcoin but other emerging cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.

Stacking sats—aka making small buys of Bitcoin on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis—is a popular strategy among individual investors, and it's also one of the safest. Bitcoin's extreme price volatility means that the market price fluctuates by the second. By spreading out an overall investment over the longest time horizon possible, people are able to average the price and avoid buying at peak prices.

What are the risks?

Even by investing in this conservative fashion, there are still potential risks to contend with.

Unlike other types of investments, buyers of cryptocurrency also need a secure place to store it. Each ""wallet"" is protected by a private key, a sophisticated tool that enables you to access your cryptocurrency and restrict unauthorized access. Think of this as the most critical password you'll ever protect – just ask the man who lost his password to access his more than 7,000 Bitcoin, worth about $385 million.

""If you're alive today, you're living through a global financial evolution that transforms the way humans invest,"" said Tiffany Madison, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency early adopter in Austin, Texas, who has been involved in the industry since 2014. Madison has seen the community evolve from a boys club to an inclusive, diverse group of investors, and she's passionate about making sure women are included in this financial revolution.

Raised slightly above the poverty line by a single mother with fierce budgeting skills, Madison pointed out that technologies democratizing wealth-building for the working middle class simply didn't exist even ten years ago.","A visual representation of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.

GUANGZHOU, China — China's Inner Mongolia region plans to ban new cryptocurrency mining projects and shut down existing activity in a bid to cut down on energy-consumption. Bitcoin is based on a decentralized network, which means it's not issued by a single entity like a central bank. Transactions, recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, need to be ""verified"" by miners. These miners run purpose-built computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles that effectively allow a bitcoin transaction to happen. The miners receive bitcoin as a reward and that is the incentive. But because the computers are high-powered, they consume a lot of energy.

Bitcoin mining consumes an estimated 128.84 terrawatt-hour per year of energy — more than entire countries such as Ukraine and Argentina, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a project of the University of Cambridge. China accounts for around 65% of all bitcoin mining globally — Inner Mongolia alone accounts for about 8%, due to its cheap energy. In comparison, the United States accounts for 7.2% of global bitcoin mining. Not all cryptocurrencies work like bitcoin, however. Inner Mongolia, located in northern China, failed to meet central government assessment targets regarding energy use in 2019 and was scolded by Beijing. In response, the region's development and reform commission laid out plans to reduce energy consumption.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways CoinFlip announced that it would add support for Dogecoin on its network of Bitcoin ATMs.

The move will increase the exposure of this cryptocurrency to a wider audience.

Following a protocol upgrade, DOGE is also ready to be used as a form of payment.

CoinFlip announced that it would add support for Dogecoin in a move to meet the market’s demand.

Much ATM for Dogecoin

The largest Bitcoin ATM provider in the U.S. said that its network of over 1,800 terminals is ready for users to buy and sell DOGE “even in the most rural towns” of the nation.

Daniel Polotsky, CEO and Co-Founder of CoinFlip, maintains that Dogecoin started as an “internet meme.” Still, its growing popularity encouraged the company to further support this cryptocurrency in the coming months.

Now that celebrities such as Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, and Kevin Jonas have endorsed Dogecoin, Polotsky believes it was the right time to respond to the growing demand.

CoinFlip has tripled its Bitcoin ATM network’s size over the past year with terminals in 45 of the 50 states in America. Revenues have also skyrocketed by a whopping 360%, as the firm has made cryptocurrencies easy and accessible to a wider audience.

Given CoinFlip’s success, the recent addition of Dogecoin could be a major catalyst for adoption.

Interestingly enough, the developers behind DOGE have realized that the protocol’s design must be further refined to live up to the momentum it has seen since the beginning of the year.

After releasing a new version of the Dogecoin client Core, lead maintainer Ross Nicoll believes that the network is operational and ready for DOGE to be used as a form of payment.

Key Takeaways Cryptocurrency exchanges have seen over 30,000 BTC withdrawn from their wallets over the past month.

Meanwhile, retail investors are rushing in to get a piece of BTC.

On-chain data shows that prices will continue trending upwards as long as the $46,000 support level holds.

Bitcoin reclaimed the $50,000 level as increased demand from institutional and retail investors continues to rise.

Demand Skyrockets, Supply Plunges

Bitcoin continues trending up with few signs of slowing down. Some of the most prominent analysts in the industry have warned of a steep correction, but the pioneer cryptocurrency remains fundamentally strong.

Indeed, the number of Bitcoin available on trading platforms is declining at an exponential rate. More than 30,000 BTC have been withdrawn from known cryptocurrency exchange wallets, representing a 1.20% drop.

Such market behavior represents a positive signal for further price growth as the selling pressure behind Bitcoin is technically reducing, consequently capping its downside potential.

According to Arcane Research, investors opt to hold BTC for a longer period because of its store of value characteristics. But the positive growth in the lending markets could also be affecting the available supply on cryptocurrency exchanges.

The analytics firm maintains that if the DeFi space continues expanding at the current rate, the number of Bitcoin used as collateral in the lending markets will likely reach 1 million by 2023.

When considering the rising interest among retail investors, the supply shock that Bitcoin is going through will likely have serious implications on prices.

On-chain analyst Willy Woo believes that BTC has more room to go up as the number of new daily addresses joining the network is going parabolic.

“Until we approach the inflection point of [billions of people using BTC], the numbers joining the network per day keeps climbing. BTC is barely past 2% of the world population, so lots more to climb,” said Woo.

Gives you an idea how this bull market is just warming up. Data: @glassnode pic.twitter.com/csGLp9sLze — Willy Woo (@woonomic) March 3, 2021

Bitcoin Sits on Top of Stable Support

Transaction history shows that as long as Bitcoin remains trading above the $46,000 support zone, it will likely continue trending upward.

Based on IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model reveals that nearly 1.50 million addresses had previously purchased over 760,000 BTC around this price level. This massive demand wall could absorb some of the selling pressure in the event of a correction, preventing Bitcoin from falling further.

Holders within this price range will likely do anything to keep their investments “In the Money.” They may even buy more tokens to allow prices to rebound.

That said, a sudden spike in selling pressure that pushes Bitcoin below the $46,000 support area could be catastrophic for those betting on the upside. The IOMAP cohorts show that the next significant level reinforcing BTC’s uptrend sits around $40,000.

Ethereum settles above $1,600 head of the anticipated breakout to $2,000.

Ripple is getting closer to a breakout following an extended consolidation period.

The cryptocurrency market seems to be flipping bullish after Bitcoin made a real move above $50,000 on Wednesday during the European session. BTC's move also poked Ethereum bulls to join the market from the sidelines, pushing the price past $1,600. Ripple has overcome the stubborn resistance at $0.45 while eyeing higher levels.

The rest of the market is shifting bullishly, led by cryptoassets like NEM (up 11%), Terra (up 20%), and Filecoin (up 10%).

Bitcoin bulls are relentless in the push to all-time highs

Bitcoin hit a record high of $58,000 in February but corrected significantly, tapping $42,800 on the downside. A recovery ensued, but price action has been lethargic in the last few days. However, with BTC having made another real break above $50,000, it is becoming apparent that the journey back to $58,000 is achievable.

Notably, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading above all three applied moving averages, including the 50 Simple Moving Average, the 100 SMA, and the 200 SMA. Short-term analysis reveals that the least resistance path is upwards, especially if Bitcoin breaks above the immediate hurdle at $52,000.

The bullish outlook has been validated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). This trend momentum indicator crossed into the positive territory, paving the way for more buyers to join the market. With the divergence between the MACD and the signal line increasing, Bitcoin's chances of swinging higher are broadening.

BTC/USD 4-hour chart

Traders must keep in mind that failing to break above the resistance at $52,000 could jeopardize the entire mission to $58,000. On the downside, holding above the 50 SMA support, highlighted at $50,000, is key to the uptrend and has to be defended at all costs to ensure that losses toward $42,800 are averted.

Ethereum steadies in its recovery to $2,000

Ether has stepped above $1,600 for the second time this week. The first acceleration failed to sustain the uptrend while losing immediate support. Ethereum dived to $1,450 before the ongoing recovery ensued.

The current price action is formidable because of two key things; overcoming the resistance at the 100 SMA and breaking above the descending parallel channel. This means that ETH is comfortably in the hands of the bulls and could rally to higher levels.

Meanwhile, holding firmly to the support at $1,600 will allow bulls the opportunity to plan the next attack mission at the crucial $1,700 resistance, as illustrated by the 50 SMA. The least resistance path is upwards, as confirmed by the up-trending Relative Strength Index (RSI).

ETH/USD 4-hour chart

If Ethereum fails to protect the short-term support at $1,600, overhead pressure is likely to soar, leaving bears with open-air to explore. The 100 SMA in line to absorb some of the selling pressure, but the primary support lies at $1,400 and $1,300, respectively.

Ripple nears a breakout amid consolidation

Ripple is on the verge of a breakout based on the Bollinger Bands. When this indicator constricts, it reveals that the asset in consolidation. Either a breakout or breakdown is expected following the squeeze.

In the meantime, XRP is trading at $0.45 after breaking above the 100 SMA. The Bollinger Band breakout will come into play if the price holds above this level, allowing bulls to focus on lifting Ripple higher.

Simultaneously, the MACD adds weight to the bullish narrative as it moves into the positive region. The indicator is also expanding the gap above the signal line, which is a bullish sign.

XRP/USD 4-hour chart

XRP will abandon the bullish outlook and start to drop in value if the 50 SMA and the Bollinger Band's middle boundary fail to hold as short-term support levels. Selling orders will be triggered if XRP slices through $0.4. Further down, the cross-border token could retest $0.35 and $0.3 before a significant recovery comes into the picture.","Bitcoin’s (BTC) role in portfolios as a store of value is by now relatively well known. Its hard supply limit in the face of unprecedented money supply increase is encouraging traditional fund managers to allocate funds to a bitcoin portfolio position, and corporations to hold it as a reserve asset.

But what about ether? Could the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain hold a similar position?

We know that institutional investor interest in ETH is increasing. The Grayscale ETHE trust had growth of over 40% of its almost $800 million 2020 inflows come in the fourth quarter alone. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.) A number of ETH investment products have come to market over the past few months, including several exchange-traded funds in Canada. And on Feb. 8, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which caters primarily to institutional investors, listened to increasing client demand and launched ETH futures.

This growing interest can be seen in ETH’s recent performance. Whether looked at for the year to date or over 12 months, ETH has significantly outperformed BTC.

YTD performance Source: CoinDesk Research, St. Louis Fed, Yahoo Finance

Is that why are investors are becoming increasingly interested in ETH? Or are they seeing it as a cheaper store of value than bitcoin?

A new report from CoinDesk Research looks into the value propositions of bitcoin and ether, as well as the different market structures and on-chain data.

Our report found that while bitcoin is increasingly seen as an emergent store of value, ether is more of a technology play. For this reason, it is a riskier bet, which explains its outperformance.

However, the full story is not quite that simple. Bitcoin is also a technology play, and ether is also a potential store of value asset.

Both assets have considerable potential upside for this reason. Ether and bitcoin could end up being considered one, the other or both. Success does not depend on just one outcome.

Meanwhile, the prevailing narratives of each – emergent store of value for bitcoin, technology play for ether – continue to evolve. Ethereum’s technological development is at an inflection point, with the progress towards migration to a proof-of-stake blockchain. Bitcoin’s disinflationary monetary policy is becoming more obvious as fiat monetary stimulus shows no signs of abating and a growing amount of bitcoin gets moved to long-term storage.","What a difference a year makes.

Goldman Sachs restarted its cryptocurrency trading desk, Reuters reported Monday, and will begin offering Bitcoin futures and other products by mid-March, according to Bloomberg.

The bank first launched the desk in 2018, then halted it later that year as Bitcoin prices fell 80% from their 2017 spike. The value of Bitcoin has jumped nearly sixfold in the past year. It stood above $50,000 at midday Wednesday, compared with $8,865 a year ago. But in that time, it dipped to $4,107 as the coronavirus pandemic began and reached a high of more than $58,330 on Feb. 21 before resettling over the past 10 days.

It's that volatility that prompted Goldman to label cryptocurrencies unsuitable investments for the bank's clients, according to a May 2020 report from the bank on the state of the economy.

Bitcoin enthusiasts had speculated a week earlier that the bank might endorse crypto in the report, published two weeks after competitor JPMorgan Chase announced it had begun extending banking services to crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini.

JPMorgan itself was once a Bitcoin detractor — at least at the top echelons of the company. As recently as 2017, the bank's CEO, Jamie Dimon, called the token ""a fraud"" and said he would fire ""in a second"" anyone at JPMorgan found to be trading in it.

""You can't have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,"" Dimon said then, according to The Guardian.

Goldman's 2020 report espoused a similar opinion. ""We believe that a security whose appreciation is primarily dependent on whether someone is willing to pay a higher price for it is not a suitable investment for our clients,"" the bank wrote in May. ""We do not recommend Bitcoin on a strategic or tactical basis for clients' investment portfolios even though its volatility might lend itself to momentum oriented traders.""

However, regulator and industry perception of crypto has shifted over the past year. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in July issued guidance specifying that national banks could provide cryptocurrency custody services and hold unique cryptographic ""keys"" associated with cryptocurrency on behalf of customers.

That may have spurred BNY Mellon last month to commit to holding, transferring and issuing cryptocurrencies on behalf of its asset-management clients, and forming a digital assets unit set to debut this year. Mastercard a day earlier said it would allow cardholders to transact in cryptocurrencies on its network. And payments company PayPal has discussed acquiring Curv, a crypto storage startup, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

Goldman now has also issued a request for information to explore digital asset custody and is looking into a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, Reuters reported Monday. As it stands, the crypto trading desk would be couched in the bank's global markets division, the wire service reported.

Bank reports, too, have taken a less cynical tone on crypto in 2021. Citi on Monday said it thinks Bitcoin is at a ""tipping point"" and could one day ""become the currency of choice for international trade,"" according to CNBC.

""Bitcoin's future is ... still uncertain, but developments in the near term are likely to prove decisive as the currency balances at the tipping point of mainstream acceptance or a speculative implosion,"" the bank said in a report.

Concerns surrounding ""capital efficiency, insurance and custody, security, and [environmental, social and governance] considerations from Bitcoin mining"" may limit the token's widespread adoption, but ""the entrance of institutional investors has sparked confidence in cryptocurrency,"" Citi wrote.

But not everyone is convinced of Bitcoin's viability. New York Attorney General Letitia James, warned investors Monday to use ""extreme caution"" when buying cryptocurrencies, citing the market's susceptibility to ""speculative bubbles"" and scams. James issued a separate warning that brokers, dealers, salespeople and investment advisers could face ""civil and criminal liability"" if they fail to register with the state when dealing in virtual currencies.

The state last week wrapped its multiyear probe into allegations that crypto exchange Bitfinex and the stablecoin Tether hid the loss of about $850 million in client funds and lied about their reserves.

""Cryptocurrencies are high-risk, unstable investments that could result in devastating losses just as quickly as they can provide gains,"" James said Monday in an investor alert. ""The recent dramatic run-up in price of virtual currencies (especially bitcoin) promises the lure of unrealistic returns and has opened the door for con artists and cheats.""

However, Eric Turner, director of research at the crypto data firm Messari, said James's statements will ""scare people"" instead of ""genuinely educating them about cryptoassets,"" according to Bloomberg.

""Crypto is becoming a multitrillion-dollar space and creating high-paying jobs around the world,"" Turner said. ""If New York continues to treat the industry with unreasonable hostility, you'll see all of this opportunity pass the state by.""","Bitcoin crossed $52,000 on Wednesday after the SEC’s Chairman nominee, Gary Gensler said that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets have brought new thinking to the current financial system. BTC price is now up approximately 6% in the last 24 hours.

The world’s largest crypto asset lost nearly 20% of its value within the last week due to heavy selling pressure from retail traders. The overall market cap of cryptocurrency assets touched $1.6 trillion today.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) played a major role in the volatility of the crypto market in the past. The authority filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in December 2020 under the supervision of Jay Clayton, the former Chairman at the SEC. The lawsuit triggered a $50 billion sell-off in the crypto market including a sharp decline in XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.

Gary Gensler is Joe Biden’s nominee for the position of Chairman at the SEC. Gensler gained popularity among the crypto community because of his positive stance on Bitcoin and other digital currencies. During a discussion yesterday, Gensler supported the innovation in the current financial system through digital assets.

“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have brought new thinking to payments and financial inclusion, but they’ve also raised new issues of investor protection. If confirmed at the SEC, I will work to promote innovation,” Gensler said.

Growing Bitcoin Popularity

Bitcoin is getting popular among institutional investors. MicroStrategy, Tesla and Square invested billions of dollars in the world’s largest crypto asset recently. The BTC price is getting a major push from leading hedge funds in the US. Daniel Loeb, Founder and CEO of New York-based hedge fund Third Point, said that he is planning to explore the world of cryptocurrencies. Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary changed his stance on Bitcoin recently and said that Bitcoin and Ethereum are part of his investment portfolio.

BTC’s total market cap now stands at around $960 billion with a market dominance of 61.2%.","Gary Gensler, President Biden’s pick to head the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, suggested Tuesday he would continue the agency’s crackdown on cryptocurrency to protect consumers from fraud and manipulation.

The SEC has intensified its scrutiny of digital assets since finding in 2017 that some tokens may be considered securities, making their issuance, sale, and trading subject to federal laws.

At his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday, Gensler said bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “have brought new thinking to financial planning and investor inclusion.” But as SEC chair, he would work with his fellow commissioners to “ensure investor protection.”

If something were a security, for instance, it comes under security regulation, under the SEC. The SEC must ensure that crypto markets “are free of fraud and manipulation,” Gensler told the Senate Banking Committee, noting that “some markets, usually operating overseas, have been rife with fraud.”

As Quartz reports, Gensler is “known in progressive circles as a tough financial sector reformer from his post-financial-crisis days as head of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, but he is also hailed by the crypto crowd for his understanding of blockchain technologies, as an MIT economics professor who teaches about blockchain, digital currencies, and financial innovation.”

He has previously indicated that if a coin offering is meant to give investors an ownership stake, then token should be subject to the regulations of a security even if it doesn’t offer a dividend, or have the typical attributes of an equity or bond.

“The investing public is clearly hoping for possible appreciation,” Gensler told an MIT blockchain conference in 2018. “When you quack like the duck, when you swim like the duck, when you walk like the duck … I think the bird’s a duck.”

If confirmed, Gensler will inherit the high-profile case charging Ripple Labs with illegally raising more than $1.3 billion through sales of its XRP tokens. Ripple has called the case “an attack on the entire crypto industry and American innovation.” On news of Gensler’s comments Tuesday, Bitcoin fell as much as 4% but was still up more than 60% year-to-date.","OK

HGreg, a car dealership company with locations in the U.S. and Canada, would begin accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a payment method for its vehicles.

HGreg Blazes Trail With Crypto Payment Support

The company made the announcement via a press release published on Tuesday (Mar. 2, 2021). According to HGreg, the crypto payments option would take effect from March 2021, across the company’s 30 vehicle superstores located in North America.

Also, customers would be able to use digital assets to buy new or pre-owned vehicles from the firm. HGreg which operates in Canada and the U.S. said that it was among the first automotive groups to integrate crypto in its daily operations.

The company caters to 25,000 clients across North America per year and has its largest inventory in Canada. Meanwhile, the company already tested the new method of payment with a few cryptocurrency transactions, while stating that the new payment option would be easy and secure for its customers.

A statement from John Hairabedian, president of HGreg, reads:

“Our desire to constantly evolve and improve our customers’ shopping experience inspires us to make bold decisions. Providing them with a greater variety of payment methods is part of it. We’re pleased today to be at the forefront of technology, giving our customers another payment option.”

HGreg joins the list of companies including cryptocurrency as a payments option for their clients. As reported by BTCManager last December, Soriano Motori, an Italian motorcycle manufacturer became the first in the sector to accept bitcoin and other digital assets as a form of payment for its motorcycles.

Also, in February 2021, electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla stated that it was planning to make bitcoin a payment method for its products. The statement followed after the company bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin.

Apart from supporting crypto payments, HGreg is also looking to hold bitcoin and other crypto assets. In Hairabedian’s words “We also believe it will be advantageous to keep some of our assets in cryptocurrency.”

Indeed, bitcoin has seen increased adoption from different firms and industries, including hedge funds, asset managers, and insurance companies. Recently, there were speculations that social media giant Twitter might be adding bitcoin to its balance sheets, following a $1.25 billion convertible bond offering. Earlier, the company said it was considering buying bitcoin.","PayPal is in talks to acquire Curv, an Israeli startup that specializes in cryptocurrency safekeeping, according to multiple publications.

The Curv deal could be worth between $200 and $300 million, according to Israeli technology news site Calcalist, which broke the news. It cited a source familiar with the talks.

CoinDesk independently reported that the deal was being done for $500 million, attributing it to a person in the same market segment as Curv.

Bloomberg confirmed talks were ongoing, but its anonymous source said they were in the early stages and could yet ""fall apart.""

Curv and PayPal did not comment on the reports.

Curv develops custody technology aimed at institutions that relies on so-called multi-party computing. The method is an alternative to the current industry standard of ""cold storage,"" which offers security at the expense of speed.

The company was founded in 2018 and has raised $29.5 million in venture-capital funding from backers including U.S. asset-manager Franklin Templeton. The venture arms of German bank Commerzbank and San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase have also participated in funding rounds for Curv.

An attempt by PayPal to acquire Curv would be consistent with earlier reports regarding the payment processor's interest in crypto storage solutions. PayPal tried to buy the crypto custody firm BitGo last year, but talks reportedly broke down by December, Fortune reported at the time.

PayPal offered $750 million in cash for the custodian, according to CoinDesk. It's not clear whether PayPal's previous reported offer for BitGo would have been an all-cash deal.

The digital-payment giant launched cryptocurrency trading for its US customers in October, in short order reporting a surge in usage. It's in the process of porting that service to Venmo, a PayPal subsidiary."
2021-03-04,"Anyone involved in cryptocurrency dreams of the day when crypto “goes mainstream.” It’s a day we all fantasize about: CNBC runs crypto prices right alongside stock prices on their tickers; coffee shops accept payment in crypto; your bank accepts crypto deposits in the same account as your cash deposits; retirement accounts are diversified into crypto; and paychecks are given out in the form of crypto or fiat, whichever you’d prefer.

Are we there yet? Surprisingly, we’re getting close. A few years back in 2017, we saw Bitcoin break into the mainstream culture for the first time. The price meteorically rose to around $20,000, CNBC analysts were talking about Bitcoin, and average people were trying to figure out what was going on. Those of us who were around then remember what happened next: Bitcoin’s rise didn’t have staying power, the price dramatically fell, and most people moved on from talking about cryptocurrency just as fast.

But not everyone forgot about crypto. Lessons were learned, plans were made, and innovators quietly got to work building the next leg of cryptocurrency’s journey. Regulators, taken by surprise during that quick flash in the pan, began planning what to do next. And institutional investors, not wanting to miss the next opportunity, shifted their mindsets around cryptocurrency.

A recent report on the global cypto-currency mining hardware market has revealed that the sector is poised to grow to an annual market value of $2.8 billion by 2024, progressing at a CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 7% between 2020 and 2024. Through its joint venture with Bit5ive, a global leader in cryptocurrency mining and innovative turnkey mining solutions, ISW Holdings (OTC: ISWH) is leading the charge by seeking to consolidate its position as an elite purveyor of digital currency and crypto-mining support services while further expanding its global product offering within the digital data services and mining center markets.

In addition, the culture surrounding cryptocurrency and blockchain in general is far more ready for the masses. Four years ago, the idea of a blockchain - a publicly accessible ledger of every transaction that has occurred within a network - was difficult for much of the public to wrap their heads around. Trying to buy cryptocurrency was difficult; few on-ramps existed to allow you to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency. Once you bought it, where did you put it? Wallets were difficult to navigate, scams proliferated this space, and few educational articles existed to guide you.

Now it’s easy to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency: simply login to one of many centralized exchanges, create an account, add your cash, and make your purchases. Using mainstream apps like Paypal and Coinbase (set to go public with an estimated $100 million offering this month) allow you to swap mainstream cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) for more obscure altcoins that they also offer. This means that the average investor can easily chase after cryptocurrencies with a small market cap - an alluring option for anyone feeling adventurous. With easy-to-use wallets readily available, and free educational content all over the Internet, navigating your way through this space is easier than ever.

We also have to acknowledge that the way the government is approaching cryptocurrency is far different this time. The IRS is directly asking about cryptocurrency on tax returns; the FinCEN is proposing regulations to bring identities to cryptocurrency wallets; the OCC has opened its arms to cryptocurrency companies interested in pursuing bank charters. These are night-and-day differences to how the relationship between the government and cryptocurrency felt just a few years ago.

Institutional investors are also heavily interested in cryptocurrency, many of them seeing it as a secure store of value in a way that replaces gold. Tesla announced it recently purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy plans to hold $4.2 billion worth of Bitcoin, and Grayscale offers investors a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through more traditional investment vehicles. It’s safe to say that institutional investors are buying large amounts of cryptocurrency and intend to stick around for a while.

Has cryptocurrency gone mainstream? I think we’re just about there. With giants like Citi and Goldman Sachs pouring billions into cryptocurrency holdings, and the government searching for ways to accommodate cryptocurrency users, we’re closer to the mainstream than ever before. This will translate into a tremendous demand for mining capabilities positioning ISW Holdings (OTC: ISWH) at the forefront of this new revolution.

The pace of innovation in and around cryptocurrency is only accelerating. It won’t be long until your paychecks are arriving in cryptocurrency, like the City of Miami is exploring. You’re witnessing the beginning of a new era: the Cryptocurrency Era.","There are a handful of factors that actually make high-quality cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin less risky than other asset classes. (Getty Images)

Not so long ago, cryptocurrency was considered by the mainstream financial media to be nothing more than a speculative fad. That era is over. The 2020s will be the first full decade where cryptocurrency is a legitimate asset class, and investors who don't accept that reality and adjust their portfolios appropriately are missing out.

Here's why:

Mainstream adoption.

Minimizing trust in governments and institutions.

Cryptocurrency is a hedge.

A deterministic asset.

Mainstream Adoption

Although some might consider this first point to be the weakest, investors who believe in the power of long trends should pay close attention to the gradual mainstreaming of some of the ""blue chip"" cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or BTC, and Ethereum's cryptocurrency, known as ether, or ETH.

Specifically, some of the biggest and most innovative companies in the world are buying crypto in bulk: In February, Tesla (ticker: TSLA), an S&P 500 member and one of the most valuable publicly traded companies in the U.S., bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Digital payments company Square (SQ) also took a chunk of its balance sheet and put it in Bitcoin, buying $170 million worth of the digital currency in late February.

Further, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, is about to go public at a valuation of around $100 billion, and the world's largest derivatives exchange, CME Group (CME), began offering Bitcoin futures in late 2017. Just last month, it began offering ether futures. Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, next to Bitcoin.

That's just a drop in the bucket compared to the total addressable market of money that can still realistically be converted to cryptocurrencies. If Apple (AAPL), for instance, converts just 10% of its cash into Bitcoin, the company would end up buying about $19.6 billion worth of Bitcoin – more than 10 times Tesla's landmark $1.5 billion purchase. Then you've got trillions more in corporate cash still sitting on the sidelines – not just in the U.S. but across the world.

Minimizing Trust in Governments and Institutions

It's not just a growing chorus of corporate support that gives blockchain-based currencies staying power. From the perspective of an individual investor, digital currencies like BTC and ETH help hedge a risk that few retail investors consider when making portfolio decisions: the trust in governments and financial institutions themselves.

""Investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum are natural ways to minimize the trust layer in governments and institutions that have failed to look out for the public and protect individuals from the fragility of traditional financial systems as they are both assets that do not require central parties to verify, create or administrate them,"" says María Paula Fernandez, advisor to the board of directors at Golem Network, a decentralized cloud computing network.

Cryptocurrency Is a Hedge

Patrick Ward is the founder of NanoGlobals and a former employee at Wedbush Securities, one of the first clearing houses to offer Bitcoin futures. He says that even as recently as 2017, Bitcoin was considered by many on Wall Street as nothing more than a speculative extravagancy. That year, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon famously denigrated it as a fraud, saying ""if you're stupid enough to buy it, you'll pay the price for it one day.""

""Now, in a time of inflated stock prices and unprecedented economic uncertainty, the case for crypto in a household portfolio is simple: diversification,"" Ward says.

""In times of uncertainty, gold and bonds were seen as the 'safe haven' investments and cryptocurrency, to its credit, has managed to capture investor attention for the same reason,"" Ward says. ""Beyond its newfound status as a counterweight to stocks, in the immediate term, cryptocurrency helps avoid too much exposure to U.S. currency for conservative investors (who) are used to keeping a large portion of their portfolio in cash.""

A Deterministic Asset

Digital currencies are assets that simply weren't possible for the vast majority of financial history. Arguably the closest asset class to something like Bitcoin in the past would be something like commodities or gold in particular – a scarce asset, widely recognized as something coveted by humanity across the globe and considered a store of value.

Daniel Polotsky, CEO and co-founder of CoinFlip, the leading Bitcoin ATM operator globally, argues that the combination of corporate interest in Bitcoin and the unprecedented increase in money supply in the U.S. makes the case for Bitcoin more compelling than ever before for many Americans.

This combo has ""created a strong use-case for cryptocurrency, specifically around Bitcoin's deflationary aspect, since there will only be 21 million"" of them, Polotsky says. More than 18 million of those 21 million already exist today.

Although natural commodities like gold, silver, copper and palladium are also limited in quantity, the total amount of proven reserves on earth is always subject to change and new mineral discoveries. With Bitcoin, there's a hard cap on the maximum number that can ever exist, and a known rate of new Bitcoin creation that is cut in half roughly every four years.

There has never been such an asset in the history of the world. Furthermore, not only is Bitcoin unique going back in the past, but it's unique going into the future as well.

""Since the blockchain has no single point of failure, blockchain and Bitcoin will exist as long as someone keeps a record and maintains consensus,"" Polotsky says. ""There's not a lot that's certain in life, except we know for sure that Bitcoin will still exist in the far, far future.""

The Takeaway

When it comes right down to it, there are a handful of factors that actually make high-quality cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin less risky than other asset classes. The well-defined scarcity and slow increase in supply over time, as well as the inherent hedge-like qualities that offer immunity from total government control, make this asset unique.

Add to that the fact that assets like gold are increasingly less and less reliable as hedges – in 2021, for example, the precious metal is down year to date despite a new $1.9 trillion stimulus package on the way and rising asset classes across the rest of the market – and you've got yourself a no-brainer if you're an individual investor with no exposure to high-quality cryptocurrencies.

Even if you aren't comfortable putting much more than 1% of your portfolio into something like Bitcoin, you underestimate the value of that 1% hedge at your own risk.

Companies like Tesla and Square, two of the most innovative and high-return public companies in recent years, have realized this and are acting appropriately. The sooner individual shareholders come to this same conclusion, the sooner they can rest easy that they've made their portfolios more robust.","Back in 2017, the idea of Bitcoin in Nigeria was an interesting one that generally got the attention of two main categories of people: the early adopters with an interest in emerging technologies and the “hustlers” that are always on the lookout for new ways to make money. The latter category consisted of the same people that turned to the Mavrodi Mundial Movement (MMM), one of the world’s largest Ponzi scheme, when it became popular in 2016.

Unfortunately, the average Nigerian has struggled greatly in the country’s current economy, and many have been forced to seek out alternatives that offered tangible opportunities to make money. When cryptocurrency exchanges started to show up in Nigeria, they made buying and selling bitcoin more convenient for these categories of people, because the alternative was to buy bitcoin from a stranger with no assurance of getting what you paid for. And, as a result, the country’s cryptocurrency community began to grow.

Bitcoin’s Rise In Nigeria

The booming cryptocurrency market in Nigeria today has come a long way from those early days as the adoption rate in Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, keeps growing year after year. A major reason for the exponential growth of the Nigerian cryptocurrency community can be linked to the country’s predominantly young population — it is significantly more tech-savvy than its parents, and it has taken to the internet in hopes of finding jobs and income that often prove fleeting at home.

Understandably, the young population went digital in its pursuit of a better life. Many younger Nigerians became freelancers in their chosen fields and started offering their services to the international community where their work is valued. But, once again, the challenge of getting paid for their work because of their location was difficult. In the same vein, Nigerians in the diaspora also experienced a similar challenge when sending money back home, as exorbitant charges from foreign banks and money transfer companies discouraged many from doing so.

Meanwhile, things kept getting worse for the average Nigerian, with the naira experiencing incessant inflation, making the country’s fiat a poor store of value; traditional banks charging ridiculous fees for simple transactions; and a rise in the unemployment rate. In the midst of all of these issues, the gospel of Bitcoin kept spreading as the foremost cryptocurrency’s major features made it look like it was specifically designed to save Nigerians.

Why Bitcoin Is Successful In Nigeria

Bitcoin’s decentralized features, its ability to furnish cheaper and faster transactions and its rising value ultimately turned the attention of many Nigerians to it, so that in a 2020 COVID-19 halted world, Bitcoin had finally found a home in Nigeria. And this reflected in the numbers, as our cryptocurrency exchange, Yellow Card, processed over $200 million in cryptocurrency volume in 2020, with most of that volume coming from Nigeria. Blockchain.com also reported that there was an increase from Nigeria in the number of new Bitcoin wallets created on its platform.

Bitcoin offered the glimmer of hope that many Nigerians desperately needed as they could finally see the chance of attaining financial freedom to be more likely than ever. And, in the following ways, Bitcoin has become successful in Nigeria:

As a store of value: The naira’s continuous inflation has made many lose confidence in keeping their hard-earned money in fiat. Bitcoin offers a better alternative as its adoption across the world increases, thus driving up its demand and, consequently, its price. As a better investment alternative: Many Nigerians have turned to trading and investing in bitcoin as a form of passive income and, despite the cryptocurrency’s volatile nature, the returns over time have seen many become millionaires. As an enabler of easy transactions: The sending and receiving of money across the border for the payment of goods and services, or to loved ones, has never been easier with bitcoin, thanks to its cheaper network rate and faster transfer time than traditional remittance systems.

While a recent directive from the nation’s apex bank reiterating that regulated financial institutions are not authorized to offer services to cryptocurrency exchanges, the interest in Bitcoin has only continued to grow in the country as, coincidentally, institutional investments have propelled the price of bitcoin past $57,000, as of the third week of February.

It is, therefore, no longer a matter of if Bitcoin will continue to bloom in Nigeria, but a matter of how long before it reaches everyone in the country. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s directive may take some exchanges in the country offline for the time being, but peer-to-peer transactions, which have always been an extremely popular and active trading method in Nigeria, will only grow more quickly.

Related","In a new report on market conditions, crypto analytics firm Santiment says large Bitcoin and Ethereum holders appear to be readying themselves for a rally.

Santiment says individuals holding 1,000 or more Bitcoin are dominating a larger share of the BTC market, indicating that whales may be on the verge of fueling a strong reversal upward.

“Bitcoin’s largest holders (1,000+ BTC) currently hold 42.56% of the total supply after owning 43.29% on February 8th (a 54-week high), which fueled the February all-time high. A return above 43% will be an indication whales are looking to fuel another rally.”

Whales are also eating up a significant portion of Ethereum supplies, reports Santiment.

“Ethereum’s top 10 non-exchange whale addresses are now holding the most combined supply of ETH tokens (16.86M) since July, 2016. On March 1st, a single-day addition of 1.03M tokens was added among these addresses, the highest one-day jump in 6 weeks!“

Although it appears whales are preparing for the number one and two top crypto assets to forge a path to new heights, Santiment data shows that Polygon (MATIC), formerly Matic, blockchain gaming coin Enjin (ENJ), Theta blockchain governance token Theta Fuel (TFUEL) and XinFin (XDC) are outperforming all other crypto assets, especially BTC.

“As we continue to see volatility for Bitcoin as it attempts to breach $50,000 again (which it briefly did yesterday), altcoins are mostly gaining on the number one crypto asset. MATIC, ENJ, TFUEL and XDCE are among several projects making up major ground.”

Recently Santiment also revealed the fastest-growing Ethereum-based projects for the month of February. They are in order:

Gnosis (GNO) Status (SNT) Decentraland (MANA) UMA Protocol (UMA) Chainlink (LINK) Skale Network (SKL) MakerDAO (MKR) Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) Golem Project (GLM) Santiment Network Token (SAN)

(Bloomberg) -- In an era of prosperity for investment banks, Credit Suisse Group AG is careening from one crisis to another and then another -- this time, with a $4.7 billion writedown tied to billionaire investor Bill Hwang’s trading blowout.The staggering hit -- the largest yet linked to market-shaking losses run up by Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management -- prompted sweeping management changes at the Swiss bank Tuesday and cast fresh doubt on its checkered record of managing risks. It caps a catalog of costly errors at Credit Suisse -- most recently the collapse of Greensill Capital -- in what was supposed to be the start of steadier era under Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gottstein.At a moment when investment banks are feasting on market activity and dealmaking, Credit Suisse is under mounting pressure to persuade shareholders and clients it can put its house in order and remain a vital, independent force in global banking. After the firm announced plans to cut its dividend and suspend share buybacks, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut their recommendation for the stock, which already was breaking with peers in tumbling this year.“The ongoing negative newsflow could have an impact on the remainder” of Credit Suisse’s businesses, analysts Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan wrote in a note, lowering their rating to neutral from overweight. “Besides the impact from various management changes and regulatory oversight,” they wrote, the bank “might have to pursue a strategy of ‘capital preservation’” that could restrain growth.David Herro at Harris Associates, a top shareholder of Credit Suisse, said the bank’s losses should serve as a “wakeup call” to expedite cultural change as Chairman Urs Rohner prepares to hand over to Lloyds Banking Group Plc CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio at the end of the month. Rohner has offered to forgo his compensation for 2020 of 1.5 million francs.Another long-standing backer of the bank, Qatar’s former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, stands to suffer a personal hit as well after vehicles linked to him invested about $200 million in funds Credit Suisse ran with Greensill, according to people familiar with the matter. As former head of the Qatar Investment Authority, Sheik Hamad had made Qatar one of the Swiss bank’s largest shareholders.Acknowledging the need for deep change, Credit Suisse on Tuesday replaced its investment bank head and chief risk officer, along with a handful of other executives. Gottstein, who took over in February last year after a spying scandal toppled his predecessor, told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung that the bank has no sacred cows with regard to strategy.“Serious lessons will be learned,” he pledged in a statement. The Archegos loss “is unacceptable.”While the Swiss bank wasn’t the only firm that helped Hwang’s family office lever up large positions in a relatively small slate of stocks, rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG managed to unwind their exposures quickly with minimal damage.Credit Suisse has now offloaded the bulk of its Archegos exposure, helped by a $2.3 billion sale this week. But the impact of that latest disposal and any remaining positions could affect second-quarter results, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The dual hits from Archegos and Greensill have put the bank on track for its second straight quarterly loss, at a time when investment banks around the world are still focused on the windfall unleashed by the market turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic. The five largest U.S. firms boosted trading revenue by more than a third last year to the highest in at least a decade.JPMorgan’s Wall Street unit generated its most fourth-quarter revenue and profit ever. Deutsche Bank is among firms that have said their investment banks are off to a strong start this year. And Jefferies Financial Group Inc. already reported an 81% jump in revenue from capital markets in the fiscal first quarter that ended Feb. 28.In an update on its underlying businesses Tuesday, Credit Suisse noted that issues such as Archegos were negating the “very strong performance that had otherwise been achieved by our investment banking businesses” as well as higher profits in wealth and asset management units.The firm is still set to give an update on the effect of last month’s collapse of Greensill Capital, which helped manage $10 billion of investment funds the Swiss bank offered to asset management clients. Credit Suisse is leaning toward letting clients take the hit of expected losses in those funds, a person familiar with the discussions said.Among the executives to leave over the missteps are investment bank head Brian Chin and risk chief Lara Warner. Gottstein previously removed Eric Varvel from his role running asset management after Greensill’s downfall. In a memo to staff Monday, Credit Suisse also announced at least five other departures, including equities trading chief Paul Galietto.Christian Meissner, the former Bank of America Corp. executive who joined Credit Suisse in October, will take over from Chin next month. Joachim Oechslin will become risk chief in the interim, a role he held until 2019 when Warner took over. Thomas Grotzer was named interim head of compliance.The bank cut its dividend proposal for 2020 to 10 centimes a share, from about 29 centimes, and suspended its share buyback until its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of capital strength, returns to the targeted level. Credit Suisse said it expects a CET1 ratio of at least 12% in the first quarter. It had aimed for at least 12.5% in the first half of this year. Top executives’ bonuses for last year have been scrapped.Credit Suisse Payout Pause Won’t Halt Archegos Fallout: ReactThe Zurich-based bank was one of several global investment banks to facilitate the leveraged bets of Archegos, and had tried to reach some sort of standstill to figure out how to unwind positions without sparking panic, people familiar with the matter have said. The strategy failed as rivals rushed to cut their losses.“Almost two weeks in, it is still not clear how the bank managed to take a 4.4 billion-franc charge for one client in the prime brokerage business, which we estimate generates less than 1 billion francs per annum in revenues,” JPMorgan’s analysts wrote.Among big banks that dealt with Archegos, only Nomura Holdings Inc. has signaled the potential to also take a multibillion-dollar hit, saying it could lose as much as $2 billion.Credit Suisse’s latest trades came more than a week after several rivals dumped their shares. The bank hit the market with block trades tied to ViacomCBS Inc., Vipshop Holdings Ltd. and Farfetch Ltd., a person with knowledge of the matter said. The stocks traded substantially below where they were last month before Hwang’s family office imploded.In addition to the Archegos writedown, Credit Suisse may need to set aside 2 billion francs over the coming years for litigation tied to Greensill, according to the JPMorgan analysts.Startup lender Greensill Capital had borrowed from the bank and helped manage a group of debt funds that were marketed as among its safest products. Now the funds are frozen and being wound down after Lex Greensill’s firm collapsed amid doubts about its lending practices.Credit Suisse said it will provide an update on the funds in the next few days.(Adds shareholder comment in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Why did this happen?

Two Bitcoin ETFs in Canada by Purpose Investments and 3iQ added a total of 10,700.9033 BTC in February, more than two-thirds of Grayscale’s monthly inflow.

Canadian Firms Add Bitcoin Faster Than Grayscale

Grayscale is losing the number one spot as the most popular Bitcoin investment product for institutional investors.

The GBTC trust saw a net inflow of 6,599.9 BTC in February, as measured by Glassnode. The inflow was significantly less—about 85 %—than the previous month when the fund added 41,568 BTC.

In comparison, Purpose’s Bitcoin treasury added 10,215.9033 BTC last month. Canada’s securities regulator cleared Purpose Investment to launch the Bitcoin ETF product on Feb. 12. The stock tickers for the investment products are BTCC.U CN (denominated in USD) and unhedged Canadian dollar BTCC.C CN.

The second Bitcoin ETF by the 3iQ fund saw an inflow of 485 Bitcoins, following the addition of 4,889.9 BTC in January.

Evolve Funds has already procured approval from the securities regulatory with Horizons ETFs’s application still pending.

A “Premium” Issue

According to JP Morgan’s analysis shared by media outlet The Block, the Canadian Bitcoin ETF is one of the two reasons behind a Grayscale premium drop.

The second reason is profit-booking by investors after the end of the six-month lock-up period. The inflows in August 2020, six-months prior to February, were around 31,900 BTC, according to data from Bybt. The fund, in turn, only added around 6,600 BTC.

In their earlier report in January, the investment bank had stated that the introduction of an ETF in the U.S. would eat into GBTC’s premium and cause a downturn in Bitcoin’s price. JP Morgan’s analyst added this week:

“We had also argued that erosion of GBTC inflows and a collapse of its premium would likely have negative near-term implications for bitcoin markets given the flow and signalling importance of GBTC.”

Grayscale’s premium in crypto trust shares is driven by demand from investors on professional brokerages like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and others. The new Bitcoin ETFs do not come with a lock-in period. Thus, the supply of these products is not limited to the issuance of GBTC shares.

The premium for GBTC slid negative yesterday and is currently below the fund’s annual management fee of 2%—effectively a negative premium—at 1.82%.

Given that arbitrage opportunities drove institutional investment, the reduced premium alternates as cause and effect, starting to hurt the demand due to the reduced intensity of the “Grayscale effect.”

An early adopter of cryptocurrency, the Dallas Mavericks will be the first to accept Dogecoin. Mavs Fans for Life (MFFLs) can now use Dogecoin to buy tickets and merchandise online, making Mavs merchandise more accessible to MFFLs everywhere. The Dallas Mavericks have been accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment for game tickets and merchandise for almost two years.

“The Dallas Mavericks are a long-time enthusiast of cryptocurrency, opening up new opportunities for the team to sell tickets and merchandise to its global MFFL fan base,” Stephen Pair, CEO of BitPay, said. “BitPay believes that with continued cryptocurrency adoption, the industry is reaching an inflection point that will forever change consumer confidence, trust and pave the way for blockchain payments to disrupt the way consumers and businesses receive and spend funds.”

With fans in mind, the Mavs use BitPay to process all cryptocurrency purchases including tickets and merchandise with all top cryptocurrencies including BTC, BCH, ETH, USDC, GUSD, PAX and BUSD and now DOGE. The ability to accept crypto expands a business’ sales opportunity into international markets where accepting credit cards is not practical while reducing high fees and increasing payment transparency and efficiency. BitPay enables businesses to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment without having to buy, own or manage crypto. The potential global market is huge and combined with the market capitalization for crypto approaching a trillion, the market opportunity for crypto is ideal.

“The Mavericks have decided to accept Dogecoin as payment for Mavs tickets and merchandise for one very important, earth shattering reason, because we can! Because we can, we have chosen to do so. We have chosen to do so because sometimes in business you have to do things that are fun, engaging and hopefully generate a lot of PR. So we will take Dogecoin, today, tomorrow and possibly forever more. For those of you who would like to learn more about Dogecoin we strongly encourage you to talk to your teenagers who are on TikTok and ask them about it. They will be able to explain it all to you,” shared Dallas Mavericks owner, Mark Cuban.

Dogecoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency with a $6 billion market cap that enables customers to easily send money online. It makes an ideal payment method with a large supply and low price facilitated efficient micro-tipping content.

Department officials have said that his extradition to the United States is pending. McAfee and Watson could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.

Prosecutors allege that McAfee and his associates exploited the popularity of his Twitter account to run what is known as a “pump and dump” scheme.

McAfee and Watson first bought large quantities of cryptocurrencies at low prices, according to the indictment. Then, they promoted those same digital tokens on Twitter, in an attempt to inflate their prices, using false and misleading endorsements — including deceptively telling potential investors that they would disclose whether they owned the cryptocurrencies that they were recommending. But these were false assurances, prosecutors claim — next came the “dump.”

After the prices of the cryptocurrencies swelled, McAfee and his associates sold off their holdings, often at significant profit, according to the indictment, leaving investors with assets whose long-term value had substantially declined. Prosecutors allege that McAfee and Watson engaged in this “scalping” scheme from about December 2017 to about January 2018.

Prosecutors have also charged McAfee and Watson with crimes related to a second alleged scheme involving fundraising events called “initial coin offerings,” in which start-ups issue and sell digital tokens to investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned that people who promote ICOs must disclose any compensation they receive for endorsing the digital tokens. In alleged violation of securities laws, McAfee and Watson endorsed ICOs while concealing from investors that they were in fact getting paid for promotional tweets.

From about December 2017 to February 2018, McAfee and his associates earned roughly $11 million in undisclosed payments from ICO issuers that they hid from the investing public, according to the indictment. Prosecutors included images of McAfee’s tweets in court documents as evidence of his misrepresentations. In one tweet dated Dec. 20, 2017, McAfee responds to another user who asks whether he gets paid to promote an ICO. “I do not,” McAfee says. But prosecutors allege he was in fact receiving compensation for boosting the ICO through his Twitter account.

All told, McAfee and Watson were charged with seven counts, each of which carries a maximum of 10 or 20 years in prison, in addition to potential financial penalties.

Tech entrepreneur and former anti-virus tycoon John McAfee has been indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on money laundering and fraud charges. The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI unsealed the indictment charging McAfee and his associate Jimmy Watson with securities fraud.

John McAfee Indicted by US Law Enforcement for Fraud and Money Laundering Tied to Crypto Schemes

According to a press release published by the DoJ on March 5, John McAfee has been indicted for a number of charges tied to his cryptocurrency operations and his so-called “McAfee Team.” The Federal Attorney, FBI, and DoJ also charged McAfee’s alleged partner Jimmy Watson, who purportedly served as an “executive adviser” to McAfee’s alleged cryptocurrency squad.

McAfee and Watson have been charged with “conspiracy to commit commodities and securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities and touting fraud, wire fraud conspiracy and substantive wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy offenses stemming from two schemes relating to the fraudulent promotion to investors of cryptocurrencies qualifying under federal law as commodities or securities,” according to the DoJ announcement published on Friday.

Last Friday, Janice McAfee (John’s wife) was requesting legal assistance from a lawyer from Tennessee. One that can work with her husband’s Spanish lawyers and they need to have a strong understanding of cryptocurrency, she said. But this was seven days before John’s indictment on Friday, and she hasn’t spoken on the indictment formally on social media. Federal prosecutors say that John McAfee leveraged his social media presence to engage in “age-old pump-and-dump schemes.”

US Prosecutors Discuss McAfee ‘Tweeting to Hundreds of Thousands of His Twitter Followers’

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss discussed how McAfee’s Twitter account held a strong amount of evidence.

“As alleged, McAfee and Watson exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception,” Strauss said. “The defendants allegedly used McAfee’s Twitter account to publish messages to hundreds of thousands of his Twitter followers touting various cryptocurrencies through false and misleading statements to conceal their true, self-interested motives,” she added.

Strauss and U.S. prosecutors claim the ostensible McAfee team allegedly took in over $13 million from investors. “Investors should be wary of social media endorsements of investment opportunities,” Strauss warned during the announcement.

After the DoJ published the indictment against Watson and McAfee, the news went viral on social media. “John McAfee did nothing wrong,” one person tweeted on Friday evening. Others jokingly discussed McAfee’s famous million-dollar BTC bet he had going for a while.

“We were promised something John Mcafee never delivered,” one person teasingly tweeted sharing screenshots of McAfee’s humorous wager. The charges against McAfee and Watson derive from investigations that took place in 2017 during the crypto bull run and expanded in 2018 prosecutors note.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin sits on top of a significant support wall that may allow it to rebound towards new all-time highs.

Ethereum's upcoming protocol update could be the catalyst that ignites another bull rally.

XRP remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in Asia Pacific despite its legal uncertainty in the U.S.

Share this article

Extreme volatility levels in the cryptocurrency market have led to massive liquidations over the past few weeks. Despite the significant losses incurred across the board, data shows that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are about to resume their respective uptrends.

Bitcoin Prime for New All-Time Highs

Bitcoin took a 12% nosedive in the past 36 hours after rising to $52,700. The downswing added credence to the thesis that BTC is creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on its 4-hour chart.

Coincidentally, the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential indicator recently presented a buy signal within the same time frame. The bullish formation developed as a red nine candlestick, suggesting that Bitcoin is bound for a bullish impulse.

If validated, BTC could rise toward the head-and-shoulders neckline at $52,000 to complete this technical pattern’s right shoulder. A further spike in buying pressure around this resistance barrier could lead to a 17% breakout that sends Bitcoin to $61,000.

Microstrategy’s announcement that it once again bought the Bitcoin dip, adding another $10 million to its treasury, suggests that momentum is indeed building up for the uptrend to resume.

That notion is further validated by the rising number of new daily addresses joining the network. On-chain analyst Willy Woo maintains that Bitcoin’s user count is “growing at insane rates,” similar to trends seen during the 2017 bull market.

As long as Bitcoin continues to hold above $47,000, all of these fundamental developments will continue to push prices higher.

Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder and CTO at Glassnode, maintains that this is a “very strong on-chain support” level, as roughly 500,000 BTC were moved at this price point. “[It is] important that we hold [$47,000], otherwise we could see low forties quickly before the next upwards movements,” said Schultze-Kraft.

Ethereum Ready to Resume Uptrend

Ethereum is back in the spotlight after core developers agreed to add the blockchain’s crucial EIP-1559 proposal to the London fork in July.



Research coordinator Tim Beiko told Crypto Briefing that EIP-1559 could be thought of as an “ETH buyback” proposal. The update will see a portion of the gas fees on every transaction get burned, reducing Ether’s supply and essentially making it a deflationary asset.



The announcement comes at a time when Ethereum has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. If market participants were to buy the news, this cryptocurrency could rise towards the pattern’s upper trendline at $1,570.

A 4-hour candlestick close above this resistance barrier would be followed by a 21.50% move in the same direction, sending Ether to $2,000. This target is determined by measuring the height of the triangle’s y-axis and adding it to the breakout point.

Transaction history shows that Ethereum sits on top of a massive support zone while resistance is weak.

Based on IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) model, over 370,000 addresses previously purchased nearly 10 million ETH around $1,480. This demand wall could absorb any selling pressure, capping Ether’s downside potential.

Holders within this price range will likely do anything to keep their investments “In the Money”; they may even buy more tokens to allow prices to rebound.

On the flip side, the IOMAP cohorts show little to no resistance ahead. The only considerable hurdle lies at $1,570, where more than 730,000 addresses are holding 3.70 million ETH.

Such an insignificant supply wall suggests that the bulls will not have trouble driving Ethereum’s price higher.

XRP “Unaffected” by Legal Uncertainty

While market participants are concerned about XRP being deemed a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple continues to expand its services in Eastern markets, where there is reportedly more regulatory clarity.

“[The lawsuit] has hindered activity in the United States, but it has not really impacted what’s going on for us in Asia Pacific,” Garlinghouse told Reuters. He concluded that XRP is still traded on over 200 exchanges around the world, and that only “three or four” U.S. exchanges have halted trading.



While Garlinghouse remains positive about Ripple’s legal stability, XRP is on the brink of a major bullish impulse. The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization seems to have developed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on its daily chart.

Although XRP is currently forming the right shoulder of the bullish formation, it can break out of that pattern. A spike in buying pressure that allows this altcoin to close above the pattern’s neckline at $0.66 could lead to a 74% upswing towards $1.16.

Traders must wait for a daily candlestick close above the $0.66 for the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern to be validated. Failing to do so could lead to a downswing to the $0.39 support level.

If XRP breaks below this critical support barrier, it will invalidate the bullish outlook and lead to a steep correction towards $0.20.

Share this article","After a few harrowing moments last week, the price of Bitcoin seems to have stabilized, at least, for now.

Indeed, Bitcoin sank as low as $43K on Sunday, February 28th, before making a recovery above $46K on Monday. Since then, Bitcoin has breached the $51K resistance line, and, at press time, settled around $47,200.

And, with the exception of Sunday 28th and a few moments in early February, the conclusion of this week marks the fourth week in a row that Bitcoin has maintained levels above $45K. At its highest value during this period, Bitcoin was briefly worth nearly $58K.

As Bitcoin continues to maintain levels above $45K, questions about whether or not Bitcoin will be diving below $40K (or even $30K) seem to be less of a concern for Bitcoin hodlers.

In fact, a number of headlines over the past 24 hours point in the opposite direction. Bloomberg reported that Galaxy Digital Founder, Mike Novogratz recently reiterated his prediction for Bitcoin at $100,000; The Block reported that a “Goldman Sachs crypto survey show[ed] 22% of respondents expect $100,000-plus bitcoin.”

According to Reuters, Goldman announced earlier this week that it had “restarted its cryptocurrency trading desk and will begin dealing bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards for clients from next week.” In other news, Purpose Bitcoin ETF, the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in North America, announced this week that it now holds over 11,000 bitcoins.

In other words, $100,000 may very well be in the future for Bitcoin. However, for now, Bitcoin still has a lot of growing to do and a lot of growing pains to overcome. What is contributing to Bitcoin’s stability of $45K, and what is next for BTC?

“The Initial Fear of Missing Out Has Scaled Back. Now Investors Are Holding BTC as an Alternative to Cash Balances.”

Richard Gardner, Chief Executive of tech services provider firm, Modulus, also told Finance Magnates that BTC’s price stabilization is largely due to the fact that “mainstream entities are beginning to buy in.”

“From Elon Musk and PayPal to institutions like BNY Mellon and payment processors like MasterCard. Even longtime crypto foes like Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary,” he said. “[…] The few people left naysaying Bitcoin are either those looking to buy-in at a cheaper price, or those with a vested interest in making sure that it fails.”

However, Yuriy Anosov, the Head of Trading at digital asset custody firm, Anchorage, told Finance Magnates that it is not just the fact that more institutions are buying into Bitcoin. It is the way that they are doing it.

“The initial fear of missing out has scaled back, now investors are holding BTC as an alternative to cash balances,” Anosov said. Indeed, institutional investors in particular seem to increasingly see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or a store-of-value as the Federal Reserve continues to print more USD.

”We’re Seeing Institutional Investors Ask for Services That Make Money Whether Bitcoin’s Price Moves up or Down.”

Companies that buy Bitcoin may not have large portions of their balance sheets in BTC holdings, but Anosov explained that the companies that have taken the leap are in it for the long haul.

“Tesla and Microstrategy’s moves have become the play for a devoted group of corporations and retail,” he said, adding that “at Anchorage, we’re seeing institutional investors ask for services that make money whether bitcoin’s price moves up or down.”

Therefore. Anosov believes that it is these long-term hodlers that are holding the line for Bitcoin: “the move down last week caused futures markets to liquidate over $6 billion of positions,” he said. “After the leverage cleared out, the market naturally came back to more even-handed levels as long term holders continued to buy Bitcoin.”

“We are starting to see crypto native companies such as Coinbase and BitGo reporting through various filings that they hold significant BTC on their balance sheets, which is giving investors more confidence in long-term crypto investments,” he added.

”March Is Historically a Bearish Month for Bitcoin.”

Barney Mannerings, Founder of Vega, also told Finance Magnates that Bitcoin’s recent price stabilization is par for the course. Vega is a decentralized derivatives trading protocol that bridges traditional finance and DeFi.

“Aggressive moves are always accompanied by periods of consolidation, which occur when traders collectively sell out of their positions to book profits,” Mannerings explained, although he does not see Bitcoin’s hold over $45K as ‘stabilization’ so much as a ‘correction’.

“Bitcoin appears to be entering into a prolonged corrective period around $50K, rather than stabilizing at a constant price,” he explained. “How long the market will trade sideways for is difficult to predict, though many speculate that March is historically a bearish month for Bitcoin as a result of the tax cycle coming to an end in many major economies.”

Gardner told Finance Magnates that indeed, “Bitcoin will be Bitcoin.”

“It will ebb and flow, up and down. Bitcoin has a tendency to go through exponential price increases followed by market downturns. This makes the market dynamics of Bitcoin, like all cryptocurrencies, different from traditional markets, though it doesn’t mean that Bitcoin is predictable. As with most markets, it is still highly speculative, and as the old CFTC disclaimer goes, ‘past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results’.”

“Corrective Periods in Bitcoin Bull Markets Often Represent Good Opportunities to Acquire Altcoins at a Discounted Price.”

In other words, Bitcoin could have a rough few weeks ahead.

This could, in turn, negatively affect altcoin prices in the DeFi space and beyond. After all, altcoins have traded on a highly correlative level with Bitcoin throughout the year so far. For example, when BTC’s market cap dipped on Sunday, February 28th, the altcoin market cap fell right along with it.

However, Mannerings believes that these corrective periods in the altcoin space are ultimately a positive thing. “Corrective periods in Bitcoin bull markets often represent good opportunities to acquire altcoins at a discounted price,” he said.

“Altcoins correlate heavily with Bitcoin, but they are much more volatile. For many traders, this offers them a chance to pick up altcoins at a large discount compared to their recent highs. We often see a lot of accumulation taking place before prices run even higher than they were before as the Bitcoin market begins to move higher yet again.”

“The Altcoin Market Is Being Affected Tremendously.”

And, even if altcoin markets have more corrections ahead in the near future, Gardner pointed out that pieces are still on the upswing in terms of longer-term trends. “The altcoin market is being affected tremendously, most notably through a resurgence in interest,” he said. “Prices are rising as they were in 2018, and those who invested in altcoins at the 2018 highwater mark and held onto it. Those people are now in the black.”

Beyond token prices, the price of Bitcoin is having an effect on the DeFi lending platforms that offer Bitcoin products to their clients.

Anosov told Finance Magnates that: “while BTC itself does not much impact the crypto markets besides their innate correlation, DeFi continues to attract more volume as crypto lenders rely on DeFi platforms more to source coins they are looking to lend to their clients.”

DeFi Presses Onward

And, while DeFi token prices may continue to be even more volatile than Bitcoin, a number of projects within the space are continuing to steadily work towards their technological goals.

Wall Street veteran, Jim Bianco, who is also the president of Bianco Research and a Bloomberg columnist, recently told Fox News that “DeFi could disrupt the current financial system the way ride-sharing companies disrupted taxi companies or the internet disrupted newspapers, or e-commerce disrupted retailing.”

Indeed, the amount of viable DeFi projects is continuing to grow. For example, Coindesk recently reported that: “Insurance broker Aon is dipping a toe into decentralized finance (DeFi)”: the company has partnered with insurtech platform Nayms to provide cryptocurrency holders with decentralized insurance that will cover software- and hack-induced losses.

There is certainly a market for this kind of insurance in the DeFi space. Just this week, a DeFi project known as ‘Meerkat Finance’ claimed that it had been robbed of $31 million in a single day after its launch on the Binance Smart Chain.

Unfortunately, these kinds of incidents are a fairly regular occurrence in the DeFi space. Jim Bianco said that DeFi is “nascent and buggy. It’s got problems, but they will solve those.”","Why did this happen?

After all, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is booming, the SEC has a new crypto-savvy chairman, and Canada, which is sometimes viewed as a beta test site by U.S. regulators, debuted a Bitcoin ETF in late February that by most accounts has been stunningly popular. But does a crypto ETF really matter anymore?

Clearly, a lot has changed in the past year — what with a global pandemic, a change in administrations in Washington and new price records being set regularly on the crypto front. Whereas many predicted as recently as June 2020 that an SEC-sanctioned Bitcoin ETF would be a very “BIG Deal” and “open the flood gates” to BTC adoption, with a crypto ETF now on the brink, some observers aren’t so sure anymore.

“I used to think it would be a game-changer but now I think it would be just another step in the evolution of crypto,” Lee Reiners, executive director of the Global Financial Markets Center at Duke University School of Law, told Cointelegraph.

Eric Ervin, CEO of Blockforce Capital and Reality Shares and co-founder of Onramp Invest, told Cointelegraph: “I think a crypto ETF is less significant than we thought before because a lot of institutional investors finally got tired of waiting and figured it out.” Ervin’s firm was one of nearly a dozen whose application was sideswiped by the SEC — the Reality Shares ETF Trust application was pulled in February 2019 “on SEC advice.” That said, Ervin acknowledged that there “are still a massive number of investors on the sidelines” who might welcome such an investment option.

Meanwhile, applications to the U.S. agency keep flowing. Most recently, the Chicago Board Options Exchange requested permission to list a Bitcoin ETF proposed by asset manager VanEck.

State Street Corporation — one of the world’s largest custodians, with $38.8 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration — will be servicing the VanEck ETF, if approved. Nadine Chakar, head of State Street Global Markets, told Cointelegraph that the company is working to bring ETFs and exchange-traded notes to market in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, adding that “Our clients have seen interest grow in Bitcoin and [...] there is a feeling the market is maturing.” Indeed, in the three years since early 2018 when Bitcoin interest last peaked:

“They feel that the market has become more efficient, crypto custody solutions have evolved to offer better security that they are comfortable with, and regulatory clarity has increased such as we’ve seen with the OCC’s [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] recent announcements.”

More success in 2021?

Has the crypto ETF climate really changed in Washington though? Michael​ Venuto, co‑founder and chief investment officer of Toroso Investments, told Cointelegraph: “I believe the odds of a U.S. Bitcoin ETF being approved are higher than in previous years.” Improved crypto custody, reporting and transaction transparency have calmed many regulators’ concerns, he said, and “The fact that BNY Mellon announced its move towards crypto custody on the same day as a Bitcoin ETF was approved in Canada is not a coincidence.”

“Investors have been looking to the US as the next potential market for ETFs that track digital assets,” wrote FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of London Stock Exchange Group that produces stock market indices, in a recent blog post, adding: “And speculation has only increased in recent weeks with the first Bitcoin ETF launch in Canada joining crypto ETP listings in Germany and Switzerland, as well as the continued popularity of the Grayscale investment trusts tracking this market.”

Regarding Gary Gensler’s nomination as SEC chairman, “This goes a long way towards advancing innovation in the US financial markets,” added Ervin, who agreed that the likelihood that U.S. regulators will approve a Bitcoin ETF this year has improved. He added further:

“As a former Chair of the CFTC, Gensler understands the importance of financial innovation, but he also has a healthy respect for the potential damage that unchecked markets bring.”

Reiners observed that based on what the SEC had been saying recently ETFwise — which isn’t much — a U.S. crypto ETF seems to be no closer than a year ago. However, when taking a broader look at the maturation of the crypto market and the subsequent institutional interest, he believes “It’s getting harder for the SEC to continue to say no.”

Is an ETF better than a trust?

But would an SEC-sanctioned ETF really be of major consequence now? What, for instance, does an ETF offer Bitcoin investors that current “trusts” like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust don’t?

GBTC and other trusts trade over the counter, not on major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, noted Reiners. By comparison, “An ETF is widely accessible to all,” including retail investors without access to OTC markets.

State Street’s Chakar noted that GBTC is essentially a closed-end fund open to qualified investors, and although shares of the trust are available on the secondary market to retail investors, those shares “are not tied directly to the price of Bitcoin. As such shares most times trade at a premium — or a discount — to the underlying price of Bitcoin.”

Venuto added further: “The ETF structure provides for intra-day creation and redemption to meet demand. This function removes the premium and discount issues which have impacted the pricing of GBTC” — though he opined that if regulators were to approve a Bitcoin ETF, “Then in short order they would allow GBTC to convert to a similar ETF like structure.”

Along these lines, Canada-based investment manager Ninepoint Partners, which launched a Bitcoin trust two months ago, this week announced plans to convert its trust to an ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange — following other Canadian investment firms seeking to capitalize on the untapped crypto ETF market in the country.

More adoption?

If a U.S. crypto ETF comes to pass, how would it play out? Would it bring in more institutional investors, for example? “Many institutions can only invest in funds, so the ETF is a wonderful step in the right direction,” Ervin said.

Institutional interest will continue to build regardless of an ETF, opined Venuto: “In terms of institutional adoption, that ship has sailed. [...] An ETF will be primarily used by individual investors and financial advisors.”

“An ETF is more attractive to both institutions and retail investors in that it does tend to carry much less liquidity risk and more transparency to the underlying price of the asset — and fees associated with it,” said Chakar.

But what about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in general? Would a U.S. crypto ETF transform that landscape? Reiners told Cointelegraph:

“There are now lots of ways for retail investors to get exposure to crypto, and the list keeps growing. Plus now we have Tesla and other public companies investing in Bitcoin. The barrier between the crypto sector and the traditional financial system has been eroding for several years now; a Bitcoin ETF would further blur this boundary.”

Regarding Tesla, MicroStrategy and other public companies that have purchased Bitcoin recently, Chakar told Cointelegraph that “Investing in a company that has publicly acknowledged that it’s buying Bitcoin is probably not what most institutional [investors] would do to gain exposure to the asset.”

She added that crypto has been around for 10-plus years now, “But it has never been packaged in a way that allows for integration into a portfolio that is seamless.” By comparison, “ETFs have proven themselves to be a preferred and growing investment alternative thanks to the fact they offer a lower cost, liquidity and tax efficiency that direct investments may not, especially in nascent vehicles like Bitcoin.” Ervin told Cointelegraph that he likes the idea of an ETF for things like gold or silver, but for him, “Wrapping bitcoin up into a fund seems silly to me.” He added:

“There is no doubt that it is a better vehicle than a closed-end product, and competition will bring better fees and price discovery, but I don’t think most investors realize that they can buy Bitcoin directly without worrying about the cumbersome burden and costs of a fund.”

“Bitcoin doesn’t need an ETF”?

All in all, it looks like a U.S. crypto ETF will eventually come. As Reiners noted: “Regardless of their [the SEC’s] view on the merits of an ETF, if they are the lone holdouts, you have to wonder how much longer before they cave to the immense pressure and interest for an ETF.”

Under present circumstances, a U.S. government-approved Bitcoin exchange-traded fund may not be the game changer that some once predicted. A year ago, most didn’t anticipate the current institutional absorption of digital assets.

As Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager and research analyst at Gabelli Funds — an investment management firm — told Cointelegraph, institutional interest in cryptocurrency continues to grow. Coinbase’s initial public offering filing and Bank of New York Mellon’s recent announcement that it will support digital currencies offer further evidence of potential growing demand: “The ETF approval in Canada is just another step in the evolving regulatory process for accessing digital assets.”

“Bitcoin doesn’t need an ETF,” Venuto told Cointelegraph. Still, even if no longer a game changer, there is little for a crypto enthusiast not to like about an SEC-sanctioned crypto ETF: “Access is access and the more access to the asset class, the better,” said Ervin. After all, “Not everyone wants to own bitcoin directly.”","What happened

Good Works Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:GWAC), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), is moving higher today. As of 3 p.m. EST, shares of the blank check company had risen by about 13% for the day.

So what

The reason for the SPAC's move is that it announced its acquisition target, and investors appear to be excited about it. Good Works will be merging with Cipher Mining, which is a subsidiary of Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) hardware and software maker Bitfury.

Cipher Mining's vision is to become the largest-scale Bitcoin mining platform in the United States, with as much as 745 megawatts (MWs) of deployed capacity expected to roll out between 2021 and 2025. But it's important to note that Cipher is a newly formed company and doesn't yet have any operations. Its first data-center mining operation is expected to go online in the fourth quarter of 2021. The idea is that the company will leverage its relationship with hardware maker Bitfury, as well as its scale, to create a competitive advantage in the cryptocurrency mining business.

The deal values Cipher at $2 billion, and this includes $595 million in cash that is expected to be injected into the business upon the closing of the transaction. This consists of the $170 million Good Works raised in its SPAC IPO and a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE).

Now what

The transaction is expected to be finalized in the second quarter, and if the recent surge in cryptocurrency interest (and values) continues, Cipher has significant value-creation potential. But like any pre-revenue company, this is a highly speculative investment and should be approached with that in mind."

Top Stories This Week

After reaching lows of $43,500 last Sunday, Bitcoin staged a comeback, managing to hit $52,000 on Wednesday. There was optimism that the correction was over and that BTC would now have the chance to return to all-time highs.

Alas, the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Fast forward to this weekend, and Bitcoin is once again struggling to break above $50,000 — a psychologically important milestone. Now, the nerves are starting to set in.

A drop below recent lows of $46,000 could open the door to further downward movement, endangering a bull run that’s been in place for almost a year… at least in the short term. Pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital believes BTC could bottom between $38,000 and $45,000 if this level fails to hold.

Traders are now beginning to speculate that Bitcoin may continue to trade sideways for now. A gloomy macroeconomic picture dominated by rising bond yields and a pullback in tech stocks certainly isn’t helping matters.

Then again, there’s always a metric that shrugs off the gloom… suggesting everything is fine. Glassnode’s Reserve Risk indicator suggests that BTC’s rally is still in the early to middle stage — even after this week’s pullback. Great. Nothing to worry about, then.

Tesla is now coming under pressure to sell off the $1.5 billion it holds in Bitcoin. Since the electric vehicle maker announced its crypto buy-in, TSLA shares have fallen by a stomach-churning 30.8%.

Gary Black, the former CEO of Aegon Asset Management, tweeted that Tesla would generate “positive momentum” if it bows out of crypto, adding: “Highly unlikely, but shareholders would be very supportive.”

Bitcoin’s price correction has also been hurting MicroStrategy — the business intelligence firm that owns more than 91,000 BTC. MSTR’s share price has tumbled by 52.8% in less than a month.

The company doesn’t seem too worried, though. MicroStrategy bought another 205 BTC this week in a $10-million spending spree that coincided with the latest dip.

While the software company began putting its existing assets into BTC in 2020, back when Bitcoin traded at about $10,000, its latest purchases have yet to break even.

Buckle yourselves in… we’ve got so much NFT news to get through. One of the more attention-grabbing headlines this week came when Kings of Leon announced it is releasing its eighth album in the form of a nonfungible token.

Three types of NFTs are on offer, with the rarest offering front-row seats to Kings of Leon concerts for life, a personal driver and the chance to hang out with the band before shows.

Frenzied activity in the NFT sector doesn’t end here. The rarest Pepe of them all — “Homer Pepe” — went under the hammer for 205 ETH this week… that’s worth $323,000 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, an NFT made up of 100 individual pieces from 100 different artists sold out within minutes on Rarible.

Aavegotchis — NFTs inspired by the Tamagotchi devices that were oh so trendy in the late 1990s and early 2000s — were snapped up in under a minute. And as sales on NBA Top Shot continue to go through the roof, the executive chairman of the sports merchandise company Fanatics, Michael Rubin, said: “It’s almost a frenzy happening right now.”

If all of this wasn’t crazy enough, an original artwork by Banksy has been burned and turned into an NFT. Ironically, the piece is called “Morons” and depicts buyers at an art auction bidding on a piece emblazoned with the words “I can’t believe you morons actually buy this shit.”

Still dusting itself off after a showdown with the New York Attorney General, Tether is really struggling to catch a break right now.

This week, hackers threatened to release sensitive company documents that supposedly belonged to Tether… unless they were paid a 500-BTC ransom — a staggering sum worth $23.8 million at the time.

Tether announced what was happening on Twitter and declared: “We are not paying.”

The deadline has now passed, but what remains unclear is whether the extortionists are attempting a simple cash grab, or whether it’s all part of a greater effort to undermine Tether and the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

“Either way, those seeking to harm Tether are getting increasingly desperate,” the company added.

There’s been another dramatic twist in the “will they, won’t they” saga of India’s planned crypto ban.

On Saturday, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said reports that the government is pursuing a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies are overstated. She stressed that regulations won’t be as “severe” as previously reported and that the authorities were determined to take a “very calibrated” stance.

The comments will no doubt come as a relief for crypto businesses and investors in the world’s second-most populous country following years of uncertainty.

At one point, India was considering introducing jail terms of up to 10 years for anyone caught dealing in cryptocurrencies — along with a hefty fine. The country’s central bank also introduced a ban that stopped banks from offering services to crypto businesses, causing several to collapse. Those restrictions were sensationally overturned by the Supreme Court last year.

Sitharaman’s latest remarks are at odds with a Bloomberg report last month that claimed crypto assets would soon be completely banned in India.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $48,445.86, Ether at $1,607.45 and XRP at $0.46. The total market cap is at $1,484,740,419,357.

Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Chiliz, Enjin Coin and Flow. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Cardano, 1inch and Stellar.

Citi

Prediction of the Week

Hodler’s Digest has been home to some pretty sky-high Bitcoin price predictions over the years — $500,000 here, $1 million there. Determined not to be outdone, Kraken’s CEO has gone nuclear… predicting that BTC will be worth “infinity.”

Jesse Powell believes that, one day, humanity will simply give up pricing Bitcoin in U.S. dollars — telling Bloomberg that a $1-million price tag in 10 years’ time is reasonable.

Research from the company he runs is perhaps a little more realistic. Kraken’s latest analysis suggests Bitcoin could next top out somewhere between $75,000 and $306,000.

FUD of the Week

The former CEO of the crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX is in negotiations to surrender to U.S. authorities next month.

Arthur Hayes and fellow executives are accused of violating the Bank Secrecy Act by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Transcripts from a virtual court hearing suggest he’s going to surrender to the U.S. in Hawaii on April 6 — six months after he went on the run.

Criminal charges are piling up for John McAfee. The crypto advocate and internet security pioneer has now been accused of fraud and money laundering conspiracy crimes. Allegations relate two schemes where cryptocurrencies were “fraudulently promoted” to investors.

Prior to today’s news, McAfee already faced charges from U.S. governing bodies for tax evasion and initial coin offerings that he allegedly advertised for compensation without properly informing the public.

After going on the run from the U.S. government in 2019, McAfee was arrested in Spain in October 2020.

Alarm bells rang this week when Meerkat Finance, a decentralized finance protocol based on Binance Smart Chain, lost BNB worth $31 million — hours after it had launched.

The team initially claimed it had been the victim of an exploit but then deleted all its social media channels. Due to the nature of the breach, some believe that a “rugpull” scam had taken place.

But there might be some good news on the horizon for the victims of the exploit, which is one of the largest in DeFi’s short history. A Meerkat Finance developer posted in a newly created Telegram channel and revealed the exploit was a “trial” testing users’ greed and “subjectivity” — adding that the team was preparing to refund all victims.

Crunching the numbers: Analysts and industry experts weigh in on crypto firms like Coinbase and Kraken being valued in the billions.","Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) made a stunning comeback toward the end of 2020, leaving many investors with triple-digit percentage gains that could impact their tax returns if they sold and took profits. Although receiving income is a slam dunk for investors, it also creates a tax liability in most cases.

So, if you've bought or sold cryptocurrencies and have no idea what your reporting responsibilities are, take note of these three items to get you started in the right direction.

1. Selling Bitcoin is a taxable event

For those who wanted to learn more about cryptocurrency, Bitcoin provided a unique opportunity to ""earn while you learn"" and grab mega profits. But if you bought Bitcoin and sold it at a price that is higher than what you paid for it, you're on the hook for taxes. Since Bitcoin is considered property instead of currency in the eyes of the IRS, you'll be subject to capital gains taxes. These taxes are a bit different than the tax rates you see when you earn income from working a job.

Here's a quick primer on capital gains taxes. If you bought Bitcoin for $12,000 and sold them at $20,000, you've earned an $8,000 capital gain. There are two flavors of capital gains taxes: short-term and long-term.

If you hold your Bitcoin for a year or less, you'll be taxed at short-term capital gains rates, which is the same as your normal income tax rate. But cryptocurrency investors who hold their assets for longer than a year will gain access to favorable long-term capital gains rates based on their income. These rates are 0%, 15%, and 20%, and are shown below.

2021 long-term capital gains tax brackets

For single filers with taxable income of For married joint filers with taxable income of For heads of households with taxable income of ...this is the long-term capital gains rate $0 to $40,400 $0 to $80,800 $0 to $54,100 0% $40,401 to $445,850 $80,801 to $501,600 $54,101 to $473,750 15% Over $445,851 Over $501,601 Over $473,751 20%

2. You need to disclose Bitcoin activity on your tax return

The IRS wants to know about your cryptocurrency transactions. In fact, the IRS is making its curiosity known on the front page of the tax return. If you take a look at Form 1040, you'll notice the question, ""At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?""

You are required to answer yes or no to the cryptocurrency question. Then, you'll need to disclose your cryptocurrency activity on Form 8949. This is where you will report the date you acquired Bitcoin, sold it, the sales price, cost basis, and gain or loss. In order to complete this form and any other Schedules required for crypto reporting, you'll need to keep good documentation. We'll go into that next because documentation is essential if you plan to be a Bitcoin investor.

3. Make sure you document all Bitcoin transactions

If you haven't documented any of your cryptocurrency transactions, taxes may become a nightmare -- especially if you trade Bitcoin hundreds of times a year. Moreover, if you use Bitcoin to buy things, each purchase is also treated as a taxable sale. This is when you'll need to weigh the pros and cons of doing your own taxes versus hiring a professional.

As a Bitcoin investor, you'll need to track how much you paid for it, the U.S. dollar value of how much you sold it for, and how long you held on to the cryptocurrency before you sold it. All of this plays a vital role in how much you'll owe in taxes, so you don't want to get careless with your record keeping. Since this process is a bit tedious, many Bitcoin investors lean on cryptocurrency tax software to automate the reporting process.

Be prepared before you file your taxes

You'll pay taxes on your profits for the year you sold your Bitcoin. If you haven't sold any of your Bitcoin investment or if you sold it at a loss, you won't owe any taxes yet. But you will still have to disclose whether you've engaged in cryptocurrency activity on your tax return.

This is just a glimpse of what you'll need to know about cryptocurrency taxes; the IRS offers virtual currency guidance that goes into more detail. Investing in Bitcoin may have come with many rewards but don't let those perks cause you to turn a blind eye to taxes, or you'll be penalized later.","Bitcoin, BTC to USD, eked out a 0.07% gain on Saturday. Following on from a 0.91% gain on Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $48,860.0.

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning intraday high $49,238.0 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $50,074, Bitcoin fell to an early afternoon intraday low $47,159.0.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $47,002, Bitcoin revisited $49,000 levels before easing back.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of latest pullback. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $24,751 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Saturday.

Ethereum rallied by 8.05% to lead the way.

Binance Coin (+0.48%), Chainlink (+1.10%), Litecoin (+1.38%), and Ripple’s XRP (+1.79%) also joined Bitcoin in the green.

It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors, however.

Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.69%), Cardano’s ADA (-2.53%), Crypto.com Coin (-0.18%), and Polkadot (-0.81%) saw red on the day.

In the current week, the crypto total market fell to a Monday low $1,347bn before rising to a Wednesday high $1,600bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $1,505bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Tuesday high 62.40% before falling to a Friday low 60.44%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 60.93%.

This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.72% to $49,213.0. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from an early morning low $48,895.0 to a high $49,275.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day.

Cardano’s ADA was down by 0.47% to buck the trend early on.

It was a bullish start for the rest of the majors, however.

At the time of writing, Crypto.com Coin was up by 4.22% to lead the way.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall through the pivot level at $48,419 to bring the first major resistance level at $49,679 into play.

Story continues

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $49,500 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $50,000 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $51,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $50,498.

Failure to avoid a fall through the $48,419 pivot would bring the first major support level at $47,600 into play.

Barring an extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $45,50. The second major support level at $46,340 should limit the downside.

More From FXEMPIRE:","Stop us if you've heard this before: John McAfee has been accused of a crime. This time it's because he allegedly pocketed $13 million from people who, prompted by McAfee's tweets, wanted to profit from the cryptocurrency boom of 2017 and 2018.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a press release on Friday that McAfee and the executive adviser of his cryptocurrency team, Jimmy Watson, ""exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception.""

Which is the legalese way of saying McAfee and Watson were accused of lying on Twitter, convincing people they should invest in the booming cryptocurrency market, and then pocketing nearly $2 million between the two of them. FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. described it as ""an age-old pump-and-dump scheme.""

McAfee and Watson were also accused of using Twitter to promote Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) without disclosing the compensation they received for doing so. The press release claimed, ""the ICO Issuers were paying the McAfee Team a substantial portion of the funds raised from ICO investors for their touting efforts.""

The two were charged with ""conspiracy to commit commodities and securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities and touting fraud, wire fraud conspiracy and substantive wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy offenses."" Watson was arrested in Texas on Thursday and was expected to be presented to a judge Friday.

As for McAfee, well, he was already being detained in Spain because the U.S. Department of Justice's Tax Division has accused him of tax evasion. Which is probably as good a time as any to run down a condensed list of the other times McAfee has run into trouble with the law, to put it mildly, over the last few years.

McAfee was previously accused of manufacturing methamphetamine (in 2009) and ordering a hit against a neighbor (in 2012) in Belize, then of illegally entering Guatemala to evade those charges, and he ended up faking a heart attack to stop the Guatemalan authorities' efforts to deport him to Belize.

And so McAfee returned to the U.S. He wanted to run for president in 2016, but lost the Libertarian Party to Gary Johnson. He became the Chief Cybersecurity Visionary of MGT Capital Investment in August 2017, but the company broke things off in January 2018. Then, of course, he tried to run for president again in 2020.

Now he's been charged in Manhattan's federal court for these cryptocurrency schemes. Oh, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have filed civil suits against him and his team, too.","Anti-virus software creator John McAfee has been charged in the US with conspiracy to commit fraud and money-laundering.

The charges relate to two cryptocurrency schemes, the US Justice Department said on Friday.

Authorities said McAfee and his bodyguard, Jimmy Gale Watson Jr, exploited McAfee's large Twitter following to artificially inflate prices of ""altcoins"" through a so-called pump-and-dump scheme, and concealed payments McAfee received from start-up businesses to promote initial coin offerings.

McAfee, who designed software of the same name, was reportedly arrested in Barcelona in October 2020 while boarding a flight to Istanbul using a British passport.

The Justice Department, which brought the charges in a Manhattan federal court, said McAfee and his accomplices reaped more than $13m (£9.4m at current prices) from the schemes.

Related civil charges were filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission concerning the alleged pump-and-dump scheme.

Manhattan US Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement: ""As alleged, McAfee and Watson exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception.""

Lawyers for McAfee have not, at this stage, been identified for comment. McAfee is still being held in Spain following his arrest there on tax evasion charges, the Justice Department said.

Watson was detained on Thursday night in Texas, the department added.

Image: McAfee, 75, is a famous libertarian who believes that tax is wrong

Watson's lawyer Arnold Spencer said in a statement: ""Jimmy Watson is a decorated veteran and former Navy Seal. He fought for other people's rights and liberties, and he is entitled to and looks forward to his day in court to exercise some of those very rights.""

Both also face civil charges by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which in October accused McAfee of

concealing more than $23.1m (£16.7m at current prices) he made from boosting seven cryptocurrency offerings on Twitter.

McAfee, 75, is a famous libertarian who believes that tax is wrong and has in the past boasted of not paying his taxes.

He launched a presidential campaign in the US in 2018, but failed to gain any traction as an independent candidate or as one for the Libertarian Party.

In the cryptocurrency cases, authorities said McAfee promoted assets like Verge, Reddcoin and Dogecoin as ""Coin of the Day"" or ""Coin of the Week"" at points between around December 2017 and February 2018.

Authorities said McAfee presented himself as an expert on cybersecurity and cryptocurrency through his tweets, speeches and his role as a CEO of a publicly traded cryptocurrency company.

They also accused him of telling followers he had no stake in the coins, even as he touted how they ""will change the world"".","John McAfee has been charged by the U.S. Department of Justice for money laundering and fraud following allegations he operated a pump-and-dump scheme netting over $2 million.





John McAfee is well known within the cryptocurrency space. McAfee was a popular figurehead in the space during the bull run of 2017 and 2018. The hype around Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) was similar to that of the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) craze currently underway.

However, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) claims that McAfee took advantage of the ICO craze. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney states that McAfee was “allegedly using the same social media platform to promote the sale of digital tokens on behalf of ICO issuers without disclosing to investors the compensation they were receiving to tout these securities on behalf of the ICO”.







Southern District of New York Attorney Audrey Strauss also explained in a press release that John McAfee and his executive adviser, Jimmy Watson Jr, “allegedly used McAfee’s Twitter account to publish messages to hundreds of thousands of his Twitter followers touting various cryptocurrencies through false and misleading statements to conceal their true, self-interested motives. McAfee, Watson, and other members of McAfee’s cryptocurrency team allegedly raked in more than $13 million from investors they victimized with their fraudulent schemes.”

The press release also explains that McAfee and Watson committed pump-and-dump schemes that earned them over $2 million.

The actions of McAfee and Watson have now landed them in hot water with the federal courts. Both are facing charges of conspiracy to commit commodities and securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities and touting fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and substantive wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering.

All-in all the maximum sentence with regards equals 60 years of potential prison time for the couple.

Not the First Time

McAfee faced arrest in Spain on US tax evasion charges. He had been traveling the world on his yacht. This allowed him to avoid being arrested by the U.S Government for the tax evasion charges.

McAfee was also very vocal about not paying taxes.

Surely our average I.Q.

As a society,

Has not suddenly

Shifted

Into negative numbers?!



Sone said ""Refusal to pay taxes"" is ""Tax evasion"".



No … seriously!



Educate yourselves.m!



Tax evasion is misrepresentation of income.



I have never done that.



I merely refuse to pay. — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) February 29, 2020

McAfee had previously been a Twitter superstar in the cryptocurrency space, actively engaging with followers and backing projects continuously. He also had a ‘coin of the day’ which would consequently pump after he named the project to buy.

However, his fame rose for being one of the first people to forecast $500,000 Bitcoin. He famously changed that target to $1 million.

The McAfee software creator even stated he would eat his own penis on television. That’s how confident he was of Bitcoin reaching that target.

if not, I will eat my dick on national television. — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) July 17, 2017

It seems that time has now run out for McAfee. The iconoclast has spent much of the last year running from the law. He will likely face the full might of the law, and severe punishment is expected.","Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- The next leg higher in long-term Treasury yields may come from what’s known as real rates, one of the bond market’s purest reads on the growth outlook.A burst of strong economic readings -- a mammoth job creation figure Friday and now a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing record growth in service industries -- is fueling bets that expectations for growth, not inflation, will dominate the narrative in Treasuries.That’s an important distinction because while higher real rates, which strip out inflation, suggest investors see the economic rebound from the pandemic gaining steam, a persistent rise may hurt other assets, including stocks. Relatively risky assets could start to suffer with the market signaling that it sees growth getting so strong that it expects the Federal Reserve to start discussing a tapering of its asset purchases as a step toward tightening policy.Ten-year U.S. real yields -- as measured by the rate on inflation-linked Treasuries -- are about minus 0.65%, near the highest since mid-2020 and up from a record low of negative 1.12% in September. The last time Fed tapering was in the offing, the real yield flipped from decidedly negative to firmly positive over the year through December 2013 -- when the Fed said it would begin cutting its asset purchases.“We note the strong March payrolls and ISM readings as early signs of a surge in strong economic data, which when combined with the prospect of further fiscal expenditures, should be sufficient to push yields higher still,” Praveen Korapaty, chief rates strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in an April 2 note. “However, a smaller inflation pick-up may tilt the composition of any yield increases more heavily towards real yields.”Ten-year nominal yields are about 1.7%, holding below the 1.77% level reached March 30, the highest since January 2020. Korapaty forecasts the 10-year yield will end 2021 at 1.9% and move to 2.1% a year later. Christian Mueller-Glissmann, a portfolio strategist at the bank, told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday it could overshoot to as much as 2.3% in the second quarter.Most Wall Street strategists say that before lifting rates, the central bank will begin to ponder trimming its bond purchases, a move that’s been a catalyst for higher real rates in the past. Pacific Investment Management Co. said the Fed may begin discussions in June to wind down its asset purchases, while Morgan Stanley predicts it will announce the start of a tapering program in January.The 10-year real yield moved from about minus 0.6% in January 2013 to positive 0.76% by December 2013.A surge in inflation expectations has played a big part in driving yields higher in recent months. A bond-market proxy for the pace of U.S. consumer prices over the next decade is at 2.35%, close to a multiyear high.But the bond market is well aware that while inflation is on course to rise, in the months ahead any notable pickups will be due to base effects, or a comparison to the abnormally low numbers seen last year when the pandemic crushed expectations for growth and price pressures.The March jobs report is likely to herald the start of even more positive signs on growth, according to Jefferies economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska. While it’s early for the Fed to declare victory on its goals, the strong data should spark the central bank to open the door to tapering discussions, likely at their June meeting -- with an announcement in the final quarter of the year, they say.Data from other major economies have also been encouraging. Last week, China reported improvements in its industrial, services and construction sectors for March. The International Monetary Fund is due on Tuesday to release its forecasts for the world economy.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“As the outlook for real economic growth strengthens and the Fed signals plans to taper its asset purchases, real yields may continue to be the driver of nominal Treasury yields. An expected reduction in Fed accommodation amid an improving economic outlook could push the 10-year TIPS yield positive before asset purchases start to taper.”-- Ira. F. Jersey and Angelo ManolatosThe Fed is currently purchasing around $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage debt a month. More insight into officials’ plans for asset purchases may come Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the central bank’s March gathering.Some investors aren’t too concerned about the climb in real rates.If that’s what’s driving the increase in nominal yields, “that’s a positive reason for rates to be moving up,” Karissa McDonough, chief fixed-income strategist at Peoples United Advisors Inc., said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “I think the Fed is happy to see rates increase like this. It’s entirely based on a kind of positive economic outlook.”(Updates prices throughout, adds comments from Goldman’s Mueller-Glissmann in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","India’s government is considering a bill to limit cryptocurrency use in the country. Image: Shutterstock

In brief India's finance minister said the government encourages a window of experiment for crypto.

Indian crypto industry representatives told Decrypt it could mean that a total ban is off the table.

After much speculation about whether India will introduce a blanket ban on crypto, the government has finally dropped a major hint that it will not do so. The Indian crypto industry representatives told Decrypt that their constructive engagement with the government has paid off.

Nirmala Sitharaman, India's Finance Minister, said yesterday on India’s business channel, CNBC-TV18, that the government’s position on crypto will be ""calibrated” and it wants to make sure there’s “a window available for all types of experiments in the crypto world.”

""A lot of negotiations and discussions are happening around cryptocurrency with the Reserve Bank of India,” she said. “[India's Central Bank] will be taking a call on what kind of unofficial cryptocurrency will have to be planned and how it has to be regulated.”

""So, we are not closing our minds, we are certainly looking at ways in which experimentations can happen in the digital world, cryptocurrency and so on.""

An exception for blockchain tech

In January, the Indian Parliament tabled the “The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021.”

The bill didn’t say much, except that it seeks to ban all “private cryptocurrencies”, save for certain unnamed exceptions (“to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses”), and introduce a framework for a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

That fuelled much anxiety in the Indian crypto industry. The exceptions in the draft bill were only granted to blockchain technology while remaining hawkish on cryptocurrencies.

As Decrypt reported last month, following the announcement of the draft bill, several leading industry leaders coordinated efforts to fight off a total ban and push instead for a regulatory approach. Sitharaman’s statement yesterday was pretty much what the industry had hoped for, they told Decrypt.

Crypto ban no more?

Nischal Shetty, CEO of crypto exchange WazirX, told Decrypt that the Indian crypto industry sees this as the clearest sign yet that the government will not go ahead with a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies as previously feared.

I think @nsitharaman just won the entire Crypto sector in India with this clarity she’s given India is going to take a calibrated view on Crypto People of India, get ready to innovate and win. Crypto Innovation: Here we come 🚀#IndiaWantsCrypto https://t.co/4wFIPPFHOd — Nischal (WazirX) ⚡️ (@NischalShetty) March 5, 2021

“It’s amazing news for the Indian crypto industry,” he told Decrypt. “Our finance minister has now made it clear that India will not be banning crypto.”

For Shetty and others in the crypto industry campaigning against a ban, the next step is now to get the government to involve the crypto industry in policy-making. “This will help formulate the right crypto regulations in India,” he said.

Why has the government cooled its tone?

Sidharth Sogani, CEO of the Indian crypto intelligence firm CREBACO, told Decrypt that it’s the industry’s persistent dialogue with the government that has prevented a blanket ban.

Sogani, who also heads the industry pressure group, the Association for Blockchain, Crypto, and Digital Asset Entrepreneurs (ABCE), knew there wasn’t going to be an all-out restriction as the government asked “very inquisitive questions”, signaling that careful consideration is being paid with a regulatory framework in mind.

As mainstream institutions flock to the crypto space, the Indian government has seen crypto as an unmissable global trend, according to Sohail Merchant, CEO of the Indian crypto exchange PocketBits.

PocketBits is one of the members of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee (BACC), part of the wider tech industry association Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). BACC has been campaigning for a regulatory framework instead of an outright ban.

“The Indian government realizes that crypto is being adopted globally by corporations like PayPal, Tesla and top-tier banks,” Merchant told Decrypt. He reckons the best-case scenario is that the draft bill is referred to a standing committee to deliberate and modify it in a way that creates a regulatory framework that accommodates what he calls “India’s lead in the fintech space.”

“The world looks up to us for innovation.”

Day 855 Crypto is a $1.5T market. It is poised to grow 10X to $15T in ten years. If India does not participate then India loses a large market to other countries. Crypto can help India realise its $5T economy goal. Let’s compete and grow our economy 🚀#IndiaWantsCrypto — Nischal (WazirX) ⚡️ (@NischalShetty) March 5, 2021

But for others in the crypto industry, it is not so much the global influence but rather the logical conclusion of an inward-looking policy platform. Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of CoinDCX, told Decrypt that the “finance minister’s statement is a sign of the government's resolve to digitize India and make us Atmanirbhar,” referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s doctrine of a “self-sufficient India.”

We as an industry are engaging with relevant stakeholders on the proposed crypto bill.

Either part of a global trend or an insular move, the latest announcement is set to calm India crypto’s regulatory FUD.","Institutional investors have been flooding the Bitcoin market, with their price gains over the past year providing ample evidence of the same. In fact, according to many, it was this flood of institutional entry that allowed the world’s largest cryptocurrency to go on a bull run and climb to its latest ATH on the charts. However, Bitcoin isn’t the only popular deal in the market. Thanks to the fact that the market is slowly becoming mainstream, institutions are investing in other forms too.

Bitcoin’s popularity and success have reaped rewards for the rest of the market, including the cryptocurrency industry’s alts, with Ethereum being one of them. Ergo, investment in Bitcoin has seeped into Ethereum as well. However, institutional investment in Ethereum is not the only way by which it as a platform stands to benefit. The emergence of Non-fungible tokens is a case in point here.

In order to understand this, it is also crucial to acknowledge the world of Non-fungible Tokens, commonly referred to as NFTs. A recent report by LongHash highlighted that institutions are exploring new business models based on blockchain and it is in this context that Ethereum-based Non-Fungible Tokens and digital collectibles are coming in.

According to the report, since the 1970s, a variety of art funds have become available, funds that give investors access to the growth that can come from owning one-of-a-kind assets such as paintings. Such art funds’ market may be transforming now to include NFTs and this, to a significant degree, further expands the range Ethereum as a platform is able to operate on and take advantage of.

The report went on to highlight that,

“It’s not just individual art collectors who are investing in NFTs. On February 12, 2021, Coatue Management, a well-known hedge fund, led a $250 million funding round for Dapper Labs, an NFT blockchain game development team, shocking the blockchain industry with the team’s $2 billion valuation.”

In the case of Ethereum, it is important to note that many of the main NFT projects on Ethereum are marketplaces for digital collectibles, such as OpenSea and Rarible. With regard to both of these market places, the report observed that they have thousands of daily active users, with their weekly transaction volume climbing to millions of dollars.

Ergo, the growth of the NFT market cannot be overlooked. From a single-day transaction volume of around $37,000, the volume surged and hit a whopping $64 million on 22 February 2021. The report added,

“According to DappRadar, the top 3 NFT products (in terms of trading volume) are NBA Top Shot (based on Flow), Crypto Punks collectibles (based on Ethereum), and OpenSea, an NFT exchange. “

While this may seem like yet another game-changer for Ethereum, akin to what DeFi has done for the platform, there are issues the world’s largest altcoin has to address if it has to retain its relevance in the world of NFTs. The scalability woes it endured when DeFi blew up in the market and surged in popularity can come back to haunt Ethereum in the present case as well.

LongHash’s report highlighted that because of Ethereum’s poor scalability, DApp developers have also been trying to build NFT-exclusive chains since 2018 such as WAX and Flow. Crypto-punk collectibles, based on Ethereum despite being one of the top three NFTs in the market in terms of daily transaction volume, trails NBA Top Shot (based on Flow) significantly, according to data provided by LongHash.

This goes to show that just as the NFT market is there for the taking from Ethereum’s point of view, addressing its scalability issues is of paramount importance if this opportunity is not to be lost in the coming year.

At the moment, NFTs are still a fairly new and emerging market and just as institutions doubled down on BTC last year, 2021 may see a similar influx with regard to NFTs. Given Ethereum’s promise as a platform, this year could be the year ETH gains massively."
2021-03-07,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Large companies from carmaker Tesla Inc to business intelligence firm MicroStrategy Inc have swapped billions of dollars in cash for bitcoin in recent months.

Yet hurdles remain for the quick dawn of a wider trend of major corporations holding bitcoin, from the cryptocurrency’s volatility to reputational risk, financial chiefs and accountants told Reuters. Main story:

Here are some of the key questions over cryptocurrency bookkeeping and tax:

HOW DOES CRYPTO ACCOUNTING WORK?

The bookkeeping rules used by U.S. companies make no specific reference to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Under guidance from 2019 issued by the U.S. accounting trade body, companies account for bitcoin under rules for “intangible assets” such as intellectual property.

Companies record the value of bitcoin at the time of purchase in their accounts. If the price rises, they cannot log those gains until they sell. Yet if the value of bitcoin drops, the company must write down the value of their holdings as an impairment charge.

Outside the United States, where companies operate under a separate set of rules, crypto is accounted for differently.

Companies that own digital coins for sale as part of their normal business hold them as inventories at cost price. Others, such as broker-traders, can hold such inventories at market value, said the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, which sets rules for most non-U.S. corporations.

Other companies hold their cryptocurrencies as intangible assets, like in the United States. Yet they can reverse any writedowns back to original cost if the value of the coin rises again. In some other cases, companies that record crypto as intangible assets can gauge the value of their crypto holdings at market value.

WHAT DO TESLA AND OTHERS DO?

Most of the publicly listed companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets are specialist cryptocurrency or blockchain firms, according to Bitcoin Treasuries bitcointreasuries.org.

But last month, Tesla became the highest-profile mainstream company to shift some of its coffers to bitcoin from cash, making a $1.5 billion bet on the digital currency.

In a regulatory filing, it said the bitcoin would be accounted for as “indefinite-lived intangible assets”, warning it could face impairment charges if their price falls.

MicroStrategy Inc, led by bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor, holds around 91,000 bitcoin. Its holdings are worth around $4.6 billion, according to a Reuters calculation.

It analyses bitcoin prices on cryptocurrency exchanges each quarter, with any fall in the value of the asset after their purchase leading to an impairment charge, according to a securities filing last month.

Payments firm Square Inc has also converted large chunks of its balance sheet into bitcoin, with boss Jack Dorsey promising to “double down” on its commitment to the cryptocurrency.

Square says it will recognise any decreases in market prices below the original cost as an impairment charge but, in line with accounting standards, will not mark up the value if the price increases.

In its most recent regulatory filings, Square goes into detail about some of the security and custody risks involving bitcoin. It listed losing access as an operational risk, with a hack or data loss potentially harming trust in the company.

It also counted bitcoin volatility and impairment among its legal, regulatory and compliance risks.

AND WHAT ABOUT TAX?

Cryptocurrencies are treated as property under federal U.S. tax rules.

Companies can be liable for capital gains tax whenever they sell a cryptocurrency. The amount paid depends on how long they have held the coin and the market value at the time of the transaction.

MicroStrategy warned in a filing to U.S. regulators last month that it could face a tax bill for any gains it made from selling bitcoin and that “such tax liability could be material”.

Other major countries follow similar rules.

In Britain, for example, the type of tax paid for trading digital currencies or accepting payment in crypto depends on who is involved in the business, according to the UK tax agency.

Such activity will likely incur capital gains tax, corporation tax or other duties, it said.

(This story refiles to correct typo in headline)","CEO of Flipside Crypto discusses why Bitcoin has surged, the SEC's role in crypto, new projects to watch and why we won't likely see a drop back to $10,000 but could see $100,000 in the future.

Bitcoin has seen over the past year both its value and popularity explode. Hitting over $51,000 at the time of publication of this story, the cryptocurrency was once viewed as mysterious by many a decade ago. It's now seen as largely mainstream: Major financial names like PayPal (PYPL) - Get Report and Visa (V) - Get Report today offer crypto services and increasingly more online retailers are accepting the digital currency. Even tech giant Nvidia (NVDA) - Get Report has created a new chip made just for cryptocurrency mining. (Cryptocurrencies, which lack a central banking system, can be digitally ""mined"" for new currency, offering big paydays for lucky digital diggers.)

But as the value in bitcoin rises to new daily highs and other currencies and projects have joined the race, regulators are taking watch -- and digital currency bubbles will pop.

For perspective on Bitcoin's surge and what's ahead, TheStreet tapped the expertise of Dave Balter, the chief executive of Flipside Crypto, which provides analytics and business intelligence to crypto organizations and pens a regular column in TheStreet. Balter, who is also a partner with venture capital firm True Ventures, has run Flipside since 2017.

The following exchange, which was conducted over email, was lightly edited for clarity.

TheStreet: Despite Bitcoin's relative volatility, we've seen an explosion in its value over the past several months, especially from October to now. At the same time, consumers have seen the name pop up at more and more retailers and celebrity CEOs like Elon Musk of Tesla (TSLA) - Get Report are shaking up the market with tweets about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Is crypto now truly mainstream? Why?

Balter: Bitcoin’s incredible recent rise in price is due to two things: belief systems and recent global trends.

Bitcoin has always been about technical stability and network effects. Early on, Bitcoin was judged by whether it was fail-proof: Would it get hacked? Was ""decentralization"" a workable model? When it halved, did it continue to perform? Over the last 10-plus years, many of those concerns have been resolved. Bitcoin works. It doesn’t break.

On the network effects side, like any form of money, Bitcoin’s value is denominated largely by how many people believe in it. Yuval Noah Harari’s book, ""Sapiens,"" notes that gold and the dollar are largely valued because enough people believe that they will maintain value. The same goes for Bitcoin; early on a small number of people believed which propelled early value accumulation, but now the network effects have become significant with celebrity investors and brand-name institutions supporting its belief system.

Recent global trends have also played a heavy hand in this. COVID-19 has transformed the world’s digital behaviors, accelerating 10 years of evolution into the single year of 2020. An example outcome of ""work from home"" and social engagement via digital tools was evident in the Reddit-GameStop (GME) - Get Report activity: The ability for an unknown Reddit community to transform the value of GameStop stock changed the entire playing field of stock volatility. More importantly, it showed the capability of the few to control the larger financial outcome. Bitcoin fits incredibly nicely into a similar narrative.

TheStreet: Springing off that, the world of cryptocurrencies is much bigger than Bitcoin, right? If it's taken this long for Bitcoin to really gain legitimacy, what do you see for the other projects like Ethereum and the lesser known ones? Are any more likely to take off in the same way soon or will each have to prove itself?

Balter: Bitcoin has created the wake for many others to follow in. And while Bitcoin is famous for being the first -- with movie-ready lore around a mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto, and $500 million pizza buying -- it is relatively single-use case, as a store of value. Others, including Ethereum, have broader use cases, which makes the arc of their activities -- and their potential -- quite different.

Take FLOW for example, which provides the underlying blockchain technology for NBA Top Shots, a ""non-fungible"" token market. The platform has already generated hundreds of millions in real dollar sales of the digital NBA trading cards. Capturing the minds and passion of collectors of all types, this is clearly a different form of belief system -- one that has generated actual revenues.

Decentralized finance applications rose in prominence last fall, largely on the Ethereum blockchain. These allowed developers to generate financial applications that replicated offerings you might have seen from the likes of Fidelity (FWAFX) - Get Report or other large banks. Nearly $10 billion has flooded into decentralized finance, where customers can receive yield without having to wait for traditional trading hours or uncountable service provisions. This proved a real use case for Ethereum.

TheStreet: There's so much in the headlines now -- Bitcoin, Dogecoin, even those digital art projects and, as you mentioned, NBA Top Shots. What do you think people should look out for right now?

Balter: Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) present an endless amount of use cases for blockchain technology -- from art to sports collectibles to game items. … Anything can be made unique and valuable. With so much opportunity, and our digitally-driven world today, there is always going to be hype before things settle. But NFTs are only just getting started.

Flipside Crypto recently released ""Hype or Legit: How to Assess if a Blockchain Project Has Real Potential,"" which clarifies the complexity of judging a project from price movement and news. To determine long term viability, fundamentals are critical: How many active accounts are there, and how active is the developer community is much more important than whether or not the short-term price is being driven up by hype.

TheStreet: As crypto's getting more popular, we're seeing regulators step up scrutiny, too, right? Is that a threat to the future of crypto?

Balter: The regulatory scrutiny is wonderful: It justifies the reality that crypto is here to stay, and is necessary to bringing effective and clear regulation to the industry. Blockchain is transformative technology that is enabling the creation of an entirely new financial ecosystem. Like any new technology -- the internet, mobile, the cloud -- it’s often misunderstood early in its cycle and new rules need to be developed to operate efficiently. Blockchain’s promise is unable to be stopped at this point, given its globality, decentralization and real-use cases coming to light. With Gary Gensler becoming the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, expect to see an incredibly blockchain-savvy individual enabling clear lines of demarcation that should -- over time -- help the entire industry thrive.

TheStreet: On that note, some view cryptocurrencies as having a sinister element to them. What is your take?

Balter: The ""sinister"" element of cryptocurrencies is an old trope that frankly doesn’t have much merit anymore. All currencies are used for criminal activities. According to the United Nations, it is estimated that 2% to 5% of global gross domestic product is annually connected to money laundering and illicit activities. In Chainalysis’s 2021 report, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity was at .34%, down from 2.1% in 2019.

TheStreet: Finally, circling back to the first question, as crypto products become viewed as more legitimate, are the stakes higher now? If, say, Bitcoin really tumbles or some other controversy erupts, could it all fall apart?

Balter: The question isn’t if Bitcoin tumbles, but when. But it also isn’t if Bitcoin rises, but when. Bitcoin’s volatility is part of the cycle, as belief systems continue to ebb and flow. There are enough network effects to stimulate continued growth, but over the years we’ve seen different levels of interest. This will continue, with different impacts. Will Bitcoin ever see $10,000 again? Very unlikely; that era is long gone. But will it see $30,000 again? It could happen. Just as $100,000 is inevitable -- it’s all a matter of time.

This story has been updated.","To say that Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) has experienced an incredible run-up over the last few weeks would be an understatement.

The cryptocurrency is nearing $50,000 at the time of this writing, and despite some volatility, it's been reaching record highs so far this year. In addition, Tesla made headlines when CEO Elon Musk announced that the company would be buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, fueling the cryptocurrency's skyrocketing price.

Bitcoin has proved to be divisive, with many investors advocating for it and many staying as far away from it as possible. If you've been considering investing in Bitcoin, here are three signs you're ready to take the plunge.

1. You're willing to take on higher levels of risk

Despite its price surge and popularity among many investors, Bitcoin is still an incredibly volatile investment. It's experienced wild price fluctuations over the years, at times losing roughly 80% of its value.

Even over the last two months, it has seen two steep falls. If you're going to invest now, be sure you can tolerate these intense price swings.

Not everyone has the stomach for this type of volatility, so consider your risk tolerance before you invest.

If you invest in Bitcoin today and it drops by 20% tomorrow, will you still be able to sleep at night? What if it falls by 50%? What about 80%? Knowing your limits can help you decide whether Bitcoin is the right investment for you.

2. You have a diversified portfolio

Regardless of your investing strategy, it's always wise to have a properly diversified portfolio. But with an investment as volatile as Bitcoin, it's even more crucial.

There's no telling how Bitcoin will perform. That means you'll need other investments to fall back on if it takes a turn for the worse. There are several ways to create a diversified portfolio, each of which can reduce your overall risk:

Invest in index funds: Having a core portfolio of index funds can substantially lower your risk. When the majority of your savings are spread across hundreds or thousands of different stocks, you won't lose everything if Bitcoin falters.

Having a core portfolio of index funds can substantially lower your risk. When the majority of your savings are spread across hundreds or thousands of different stocks, you won't lose everything if Bitcoin falters. Invest in a variety of industries: If you opt to invest in individual stocks, try to invest in companies across multiple industries. Even if you're investing in a dozen or so stocks, if they're all from the same industry, you risk putting too many eggs in one basket. If you're investing in Bitcoin, you want your core portfolio to be as stable as possible.

If you opt to invest in individual stocks, try to invest in companies across multiple industries. Even if you're investing in a dozen or so stocks, if they're all from the same industry, you risk putting too many eggs in one basket. If you're investing in Bitcoin, you want your core portfolio to be as stable as possible. Stick to well-established companies: Having a portfolio full of stocks that are very likely to perform well can reduce your overall risk. This doesn't mean you can only invest in organizations that are household names, but you may want to avoid investing most of your money in start-ups.

There's no hard-and-fast rule as to how diversified your portfolio should be. But if you're investing in a wide variety of solid companies that can stand the test of time, you may be ready to add Bitcoin to your portfolio.

3. You're able to invest for the long term

One of the best ways to make a lot of money in the stock market is to buy solid investments and hold them for as long as you can. The same holds true for Bitcoin, so think about how many years you're willing to wait to see significant returns.

If money is tight and you expect you may need to sell your investments within the next few years, it may not be the right time to invest. But if you're able to keep your money invested for at least five to seven years (or more), you may be ready.

""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes."" -- Warren Buffett

Bitcoin isn't the right investment for everyone, so make sure you're making this decision carefully. If you already have a healthy portfolio and are willing to take calculated risks, investing in Bitcoin may be a wise choice. Otherwise, you may want to steer clear of it for now.","MicroStrategy, Tesla and Square have done it. So have many others, although more quietly.

I’m talking about holding corporate treasury reserves in bitcoin. This trend is attracting attention even from trade press. Consultancies and crypto companies are scrambling to launch services to help businesses navigate the process. “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer thinks it’s “almost irresponsible” for companies to not do so. This week, sponsored content from Deloitte explaining the benefits and risks appeared in the Wall Street Journal.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.

Whether it’s a good idea or not – that’s up to each corporate treasurer to decide – one question we’re starting to hear is: What about ether?

Would the native token of the Ethereum blockchain make a good corporate reserve asset?

Bitcoin on balance sheets

The main arguments for bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset are:

The asymmetric risk return

As part of a future-first strategy

In preparation for accepting bitcoin as payment

It is more likely to hold its value going forward than the dollar

This last point is key, as the main role of the corporate treasury function is the preservation of capital. Here bitcoin’s leading value proposition – as a store of value – comes into play.

Critics will point out that bitcoin is way too volatile to be a store of value. That’s a short-term view of the concept, however. Over the next week, month, perhaps even year, bitcoin’s price may fall relative to fiat currencies. Longer term, however, in an environment of money supply increasing much faster than demand, a fixed-supply bearer asset such as bitcoin is likely to appreciate in value relative to assets without a fixed supply, such as the U.S. dollar. As investor Paul Tudor Jones pointed out, even at only the 2% inflation target, cash is a “wasting asset.”

Do these arguments hold for ether?

Not so much, no. But that doesn’t mean ether won’t end up on corporate balance sheets.

Store of value

Ether’s supply has no limit. It is still considered a store of value, however, as its supply growth is modest (currently around 4%, expected to decrease over time) and likely to remain well below growth in demand.

Yet the store of value narrative is not – at this stage – the main driver behind ETH’s investment case, especially in the eyes of institutional investors.

Ethereum is seen more as a technology play. More than that, it’s one of the more liquid, experimental technology plays accessible to investors today. It’s not just trying to build a faster rocket or streamline dentistry. It’s aiming to reinvent the way automated applications of any type are run. Its goal is to build the ultimate base layer of a global digital economy. As well-known macro analyst Jim Bianco said earlier this week, decentralized finance is “recreating the entire financial system.” Ethereum-based applications are also likely to impact markets, governance, energy, public services, perhaps even how identity is managed.

What’s more, this will happen on a network that can reach anyone, anywhere, who can connect to a public network.

Bitcoin is also a technology bet – it unleashed on the world an entirely new way of transmitting value. But the basic parameters were baked in at conception. Meaningful upgrades are few and years in the making.

Ethereum is not only a bet on the growth of a decentralized economy, it’s also a bet on a whole new type of connectivity and innovation layer. And its technology is not yet fully formed.

Because it is such an early bet on such a radical innovation, the risk is even higher than with bitcoin. This can be seen in its volatility:

Source: CoinDesk Research, St. Louis Fed, Yahoo Finance

If bitcoin’s volatility is a deterrent for corporate treasurers, ether is understandably even more so.

Ether on balance sheets

This doesn’t mean that ether won’t end up on corporate balance sheets, however. Rather than as corporate reserves, it’s more likely to do so in working capital.

Ether is needed to power applications on Ethereum, either as an input or for the transaction fees. Any company hoping to use the Ethereum platform for internal processes such as contract management, collateral allocation or yield optimization, or for client-facing services such as trading, lending or insurance, will need a steady supply.

The launch of ETH futures on the CME earlier this year will encourage this, as it offers tools to reduce the volatility risk. The maturation of ETH options will further support risk management.

The accumulation of ether as working capital may have already started. This week, Meitu – a software and social media app company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange – disclosed purchases in bitcoin and ether of approximately $18 million and $22 million respectively, and had this to say about its ether purchase:

“The Group is currently evaluating the feasibility of integrating blockchain technologies to its various overseas businesses … the ether purchased would become the gas reserve for the Group’s potential dAPP(s) to consume in the future.”

It is early days yet as few companies outside the crypto industry have integrated Ethereum-based applications. Signs are emerging that interest is awakening, however. This week, multinational insurance company Aon Mutual, whose origins go back more than 100 years, embarked on a decentralized insurance pilot. Last month we reported that Deutsche Telekom, Europe’s largest telecommunications company by revenue, was experimenting with decentralized data.

As Ethereum use cases begin to impact traditional businesses, and as even more crypto companies using decentralized applications grow to meaningful size, we will start to hear more mainstream conversations about ether on balance sheets.

Greater focus on the asset’s role in powering digital processes will add another layer to its value proposition. As we saw above, ether is a technology play. It is also a store of value. Institutional investors are increasingly interested in ETH for these reasons. Going forward, ETH is likely to also benefit from a growing recognition of its role as a consumable commodity.

“Digital oil,” if you will, to bitcoin’s “digital gold.”

CHAIN LINKS

According to sources, Goldman Sachs has relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk after a three-year hiatus and plans to once again support bitcoin futures trading. TAKEAWAY: By this stage, we don’t actually need further proof that the “institutions are here,” but here it is anyway. Goldman wouldn’t be doing this if its clients weren’t asking for it. As if to emphasize the point, news came out this week about a Goldman client survey that shows that, out of 280 respondents, 40% have exposure to cryptocurrencies and 22% of respondents expect the price of bitcoin to be over $100,000 in 12 months.

Other surveys produce different results. JPMorgan surveyed 3,400 institutional investors, 78% of whom said it was unlikely their firm will invest in or offer trading services for crypto.

Galaxy Digital’s institutional-grade ether funds have raised over $32 million since their February launch, according to documents filed this week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. TAKEAWAY: The distribution is still relatively narrow, but not insignificant – five institutional investors have placed sizable bets on the evolution of the Ethereum blockchain. (See our special report on the differences between bitcoin and ether from an institutional investment perspective.)

Crypto custodian BitGo has received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for a New York trust charter. TAKEAWAY: This brings more crypto custody services, this time from one of the longest-standing businesses in the industry, to Wall Street hedge funds and, even more intriguingly, to Wall Street banks, who just might be interested in offering this service to their clients.

Crypto exchange Kraken is contemplating a public listing in 2022, according to an interview with the CEO Jesse Powell on Bloomberg TV. TAKEAWAY: As one of the largest exchanges in the industry, a Kraken listing would give us more valuable insight into market plumbing. So far, we only have the Coinbase filing documents to go by, and – eye-opening as they were – they don’t yet paint a full picture of the industry’s potential.","Quick take:

Meitu, a Chinese Technology Company, has purchased 379.12 Bitcoin and 15k Ethereum

The purchase was made on the 5th of March at a cost of $22.1M and $17.9M respectively

Meitu made the purchases as part of its crypto investment strategy approved by its board of directors

Staking sats and ETH by institutions is now a global affair

The Chinese technology company of Meitu, has announced that it purchased 379.12 Bitcoin and 15,000 Ethereum at a cost of $22.1 million and $17.9 million. According to the official announcement, the purchases of Bitcoin and Ethereum were made on the 5th of March in open market transactions.

Meitu Purchases Bitcoin and Ethereum as Part of Crypto Investment Plan

The purchases are part of Meitu’s ‘Cryptocurrency Investment Plan’ approved by its board of directors under which Meitu Inc. can purchase up to $100 million worth of digital assets, by utilizing existing cash reserves excluding proceeds from the Company’s initial public offering.

The decision of Meitu’s board of directors to come up with a ‘Cryptocurrency Investment Plan’ is motivated by the potential of blockchain technology as explained below.

The Board takes the view that blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt both existing financial and technology industries, similar to the manner in which mobile internet has disrupted the PC internet and many other offline industries. The Board believes that the blockchain industry is still in its early stage, analogous to the mobile internet industry in circa 2005. Against this backdrop, the Board believes cryptocurrencies have ample room for appreciation in value and by allocating part of its treasury in cryptocurrencies can also serve as a diversification to holding cash (which is subject to depreciation pressure due to aggressive increases in money supply by central banks globally) in treasury management.

Institutions Staking Sats and ETH Has Now Gone Global

According to data from Longhash, five major institutions based in China have made significant investments in Bitcoin this year.

Meitu is the first major non-Western company to voluntarily declare its purchases of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company buying both assets and adding them to its treasury is a sign of things to come as global institutions look for alternative stores of value to hedge against inflation.","FILE PHOTO: A logo of Meitu is displayed at a news conference on the company's results in Hong Kong, China March 24, 2017. REUTERS/Bobby Yip

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese photo editing app Meitu Inc rose as much as 14.4% on Monday morning after the company said it had bought $40 million of cryptocurrencies.

The beauty-focussed technology firm said in a Sunday evening exchange filing that it bought $22.1 million worth of Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, and $17.9 million worth of Bitcoin on March 5.

Meitu is the latest company to say it will hold cryptocurrencies as part of its treasury operations. Last month, Tesla Inc revealed it had bought $1.5 billion of Bitcoin, which sent the token’s price up 20%.

Meitu said the purchase was partly for investment and partly as preparation to enter the blockchain industry, and that it would finance it from its existing cash reserves.

The company is evaluating the feasibility of integrating blockchain technologies into its overseas businesses, which could include projects on the Ethereum blockchain network.

Ether powers contracts and applications on the Ethereum network, and so purchasing it was a “logical preparation”, the filing said.

Meitu’s shares pared gains and were last up 5%, outpacing a 0.5% rise in the local benchmark index.","Why did this happen?

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $49,390.18-$51.982.31 (CoinDesk 20)

BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.

Bitcoin trading on TradingView Source: TradingView

Bitcoin’s price in recent weeks has retreated from February’s all-time highs, declining alongside U.S. stocks as investors grew increasingly concerned rising U.S. government bond yields might prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, curtailing the easy-money era that has boosted risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrency.

But on Monday, bitcoin’s price climbed for a fourth straight day, even as 10-year bond yields continued their march toward 1.6%. U.S. stocks slipped.

“It is interesting to note that Treasury yields and the U.S. Dollar Index are both moving up but bitcoin, unlike previous times, is not moving inversely to them,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, told CoinDesk.

At the moment there’s little evidence of a surge in trading volume that might reflect a fresh jolt of market intensity. The daily volume reported by eight U.S.-focused exchanges CoinDesk tracks has remained flat, in keeping with the trend of almost two weeks.

Source: CryptoCompare

One bullish sign continues to develop: balances of bitcoin held on exchanges have reached the lowest level since November 2018, according to data from blockchain data site Glassnode. Market analysts have interpreted the lower bitcoin balance on exchanges as a bullish sign, an indication that few traders are planning to sell out of their long positions. That could imply low chances of a major market correction in the near term.

While trading activity is relatively muted, with bitcoin holding above $50,000, some analysts are eyeing the next resistance level.

“It looks like $52,000 is the important resistance we are looking to break,” Tu said.

Others, however, warn that if bond yields and dollar strength continue to rise, the crypto market might turn weak again.

“With the U.S. rates market, we might see some choppy moves with risk-off sentiment spilling over into crypto markets,” Annabelle Huang, partner at crypto market maker Amber Group, told CoinDesk.

Huang said a near-term supporting level for bitcoin would be in the range of $40,000 to $43,000. She says past visits to those levels have been tempting enough to draw in buyers.

Ether outperforms bitcoin, market awaits Ethereum upgrade

There’s a new force in the ether market: The mania for non-fungible tokens, also known as NFTs, a fast-growing sub-sector within the crypto industry that so far has largely been built atop the Ethereum blockchain.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up on Monday, trading around $1,773.21 and climbing 7.37% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Ether has outperformed by bitcoin since reaching an all-time high above $2,000 on Feb. 19. It is currently benefiting from the eye-popping sales of non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the prospect that further growth might spur more ether demand.

The NFT craze continues this week, and with the vast majority of NFT tokens built atop the Ethereum blockchain, the ether market is attracting new bullish speculation, according to Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer of investment firm Ether Capital.

At the same time, Ethereum’s scheduled “Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559” (EIP 1559) upgrade has gotten investor attention.

“One of the big issues at the moment from mainstream investors is their concern about transaction fees and the usability of Ethereum,” Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer at Ether Capital, told CoinDesk. He noted that a significant amount of investment in Ethereum has been focusing on scaling solutions.

Ethereum blockchain users right now pay a “gas” fee to a miner for a transaction to be included in a block. Such fees make up a substantial part of miners’ overall income, David Derhy, analyst at investment platform eToro, said in explaining EIP 1559. “However, under the new proposals, gas fees will be sent to the network instead in a new fee structure called a ‘basefee.’”

“We expect ether to break new ground above $2,000 this year, with the hard fork and the fee changes all helping to cement its position as the No. 2 crypto asset, stoking further demand,” Derhy said.

He added that ether’s price rally proves the updates are mostly welcomed by the market.

Bitcoin price was stuck at trying to go beyond $51k, while Ethereum pushed against $1,600

Fundamental analysis: What is driving the prices?

As mentioned, the past week did not see significant moves for BTC and ETH prices. With that said, there were a few events that may have helped investors gain renewed confidence in the market.

One of them is a Bitcoin forecast based on the coin’s stock-to-flow model, which indicated that BTC could not only reach $100,000 per coin by the end of the year, but also exceed it. According to the forecast, published by Plan B on Twitter, BTC price could go anywhere from $100k to $288k before the year ends.

A few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve appointed a pro-Bitcoin Chief Innovation Officer, Sunayna Tuteja. However, this was not the last pro-crypto individual to take up a notable position; President Biden’s SEC chair pick, Gary Gensler, also has a positive stance towards cryptocurrencies. Gensler is an MIT professor who teaches about cryptocurrencies and is a former CFTC chairman. If he were to become the SEC chairman, he would likely have a major impact on the development of the crypto sector in the future period.

While Ethereum is clearly following Bitcoin’s lead — the two coins have near-identical charts — ETH did see some important development on its end, as well. Namely, Amazon-managed blockchain, which has been teasing support for Ether for over two years now, finally came through and added support for the coin. Now Ethereum has a powerful new use case, while AWS customers can provision Ethereum nodes in minutes and with great ease.

Technical analysis: Bitcoin and Ethereum charts reveal BTC dominance

Bitcoin’s market dominance has been undeniable, and further evidence of its strength can be seen by anyone willing to compare BTC and ETH charts on CEX.IO.

The coin has led the market upwards from a significant drop in the last week of February. Its own price recovered from $43.2k to $50k on the first day of March. After that, BTC saw a short correction to $48.6k, only to surge once again and even go beyond $52k on 3 March. This was followed by yet another correction, which ended up taking it back down to $46k by 5 March.

Bitcoin did not stay at the bottom long, however, as it began another recovery — this time however, it was interrupted before it managed to reach $50,000 per coin. At the time of writing, its price sits at $49,000, trying to grow further up, but being kept back by a strong resistance at $50k.

Ethereum has followed this price performance, although it saw a significant number of fairly small fluctuations along the way.

After hitting $1,299 on 28 February, according to CEX.IO, ETH price skyrocketed, hitting $1,600 in the early hours of 2 March. Similar to Bitcoin; Ethereum saw correction after this, followed by another surge — this time to $1,657. The surge was once again replaced by a price drop to $1,450, with ETH currently trading in the green, as it makes another recovery.

What will happen with BTC and ETH?

While both coins have fallen below their respective ATHs, most analysts and experts agree that the rally is not over — just temporarily delayed. Plan B’s forecast that BTC will go anywhere from $100k to $288k is certainly an optimistic one. We, however, expect to see BTC at $50,000 by the end of this quarter, which will also mean the end of this month. We expect to see the return of the rally sometime in Q2, which will then take Bitcoin to a new ATH at $80,000. By the end of the year, the coin could go up a bit more, and hit $90,000 per unit.

As for Ethereum, we expected its price to still be at $1,300 by the end of Q1, and while this is not impossible, it does seem unlikely at this point, since the coin has strongly outperformed all expectations. However, it has yet to return to its ATH, which we believe it will, and that its price can grow to $2,200. It could be back above $2k by the end of Q2, and then we expect it to more than double this price by hitting $4,900 by the end of the year.

Update: Bitcoin and Ethereum once again testing respective resistances

This Monday, 8 March, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices made another surge up. In Bitcoin’s case, the coin managed to breach the $50k resistance and go up to $51.5k before a correction started knocking the price down. At the time of writing, BTC price is back down below $49,725.

As for Ethereum, the coin saw similar behaviour, although with a bit more success than BTC. It managed to reach a new resistance at $1,750 twice in the past 12 hours before the barrier level rejected it down to $1,677, where it sits at the time of writing.","Actress Angelababy attends Meitu's smartphone promotional event on November 23, 2017 in Beijing, China.

Chinese beauty app maker Meitu has scooped up $40 million worth of bitcoin and ethereum.

The company could make crypto purchases of up to $100 million under a plan approved by its board.

Meitu appears to be the first major corporate buyer of ethereum.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Meitu, a hot Chinese app maker, on Sunday revealed a $40 million cryptocurrency investment in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

The photo-retouching company, which is hugely popular in China, said it bought 15,000 units of ether and 379.12 units of bitcoin at about $22.1 million and $17.9 million, respectively.

Meitu appears to be the first major company to have purchased ether, a digital asset that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Under a plan approved by its board of directors, the company said it could use cash reserves to make crypto purchases of up to $100 million.

The company said cryptocurrency prices ""are still highly volatile,"" but added its $40 million bet serves as a means of diversification away from just cash and strengthening long-term shareholder value.

Meitu said it invested in ether as a ""logical preparation"" to enter the blockchain industry since Ethereum has the largest number of decentralized applications on its network.

""Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt both existing financial and technology industries, similar to the manner in which mobile internet has disrupted the PC internet and many other offline industries,"" the company said in a statement. Meitu therefore plans to evaluate the technology for its future projects.

The company said it added bitcoin to its portfolio after seeing an increasing number of publicly-listed companies adopting the token. A flurry of crypto investment by major Wall Street players saw bitcoin's price hit an all-time high of $58,354 in late February.

Bitcoin was last trading 1.6% down at $50,148, while ether fell 0.6% to $1,715 on Monday. Both are up 70% and 136% year-to-date, respectively.

Shares in Meitu closed 6.6% lower at $2.54 per share, after rising by more than 14% at one point earlier in the day.","Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- The next leg higher in long-term Treasury yields may come from what’s known as real rates, one of the bond market’s purest reads on the growth outlook.A burst of strong economic readings -- a mammoth job creation figure Friday and now a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing record growth in service industries -- is fueling bets that expectations for growth, not inflation, will dominate the narrative in Treasuries.That’s an important distinction because while higher real rates, which strip out inflation, suggest investors see the economic rebound from the pandemic gaining steam, a persistent rise may hurt other assets, including stocks. Relatively risky assets could start to suffer with the market signaling that it sees growth getting so strong that it expects the Federal Reserve to start discussing a tapering of its asset purchases as a step toward tightening policy.Ten-year U.S. real yields -- as measured by the rate on inflation-linked Treasuries -- are about minus 0.65%, near the highest since mid-2020 and up from a record low of negative 1.12% in September. The last time Fed tapering was in the offing, the real yield flipped from decidedly negative to firmly positive over the year through December 2013 -- when the Fed said it would begin cutting its asset purchases.“We note the strong March payrolls and ISM readings as early signs of a surge in strong economic data, which when combined with the prospect of further fiscal expenditures, should be sufficient to push yields higher still,” Praveen Korapaty, chief rates strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in an April 2 note. “However, a smaller inflation pick-up may tilt the composition of any yield increases more heavily towards real yields.”Ten-year nominal yields are about 1.7%, holding below the 1.77% level reached March 30, the highest since January 2020. Korapaty forecasts the 10-year yield will end 2021 at 1.9% and move to 2.1% a year later. Christian Mueller-Glissmann, a portfolio strategist at the bank, told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday it could overshoot to as much as 2.3% in the second quarter.Most Wall Street strategists say that before lifting rates, the central bank will begin to ponder trimming its bond purchases, a move that’s been a catalyst for higher real rates in the past. Pacific Investment Management Co. said the Fed may begin discussions in June to wind down its asset purchases, while Morgan Stanley predicts it will announce the start of a tapering program in January.The 10-year real yield moved from about minus 0.6% in January 2013 to positive 0.76% by December 2013.A surge in inflation expectations has played a big part in driving yields higher in recent months. A bond-market proxy for the pace of U.S. consumer prices over the next decade is at 2.35%, close to a multiyear high.But the bond market is well aware that while inflation is on course to rise, in the months ahead any notable pickups will be due to base effects, or a comparison to the abnormally low numbers seen last year when the pandemic crushed expectations for growth and price pressures.The March jobs report is likely to herald the start of even more positive signs on growth, according to Jefferies economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska. While it’s early for the Fed to declare victory on its goals, the strong data should spark the central bank to open the door to tapering discussions, likely at their June meeting -- with an announcement in the final quarter of the year, they say.Data from other major economies have also been encouraging. Last week, China reported improvements in its industrial, services and construction sectors for March. The International Monetary Fund is due on Tuesday to release its forecasts for the world economy.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“As the outlook for real economic growth strengthens and the Fed signals plans to taper its asset purchases, real yields may continue to be the driver of nominal Treasury yields. An expected reduction in Fed accommodation amid an improving economic outlook could push the 10-year TIPS yield positive before asset purchases start to taper.”-- Ira. F. Jersey and Angelo ManolatosThe Fed is currently purchasing around $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage debt a month. More insight into officials’ plans for asset purchases may come Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the central bank’s March gathering.Some investors aren’t too concerned about the climb in real rates.If that’s what’s driving the increase in nominal yields, “that’s a positive reason for rates to be moving up,” Karissa McDonough, chief fixed-income strategist at Peoples United Advisors Inc., said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “I think the Fed is happy to see rates increase like this. It’s entirely based on a kind of positive economic outlook.”(Updates prices throughout, adds comments from Goldman’s Mueller-Glissmann in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Why did this happen?

2021-03-09,"Bitcoin hit the $1 trillion market capitalization threshold for the second time early Tuesday, climbing to a two-week high.

Bitcoin was trading above the $54,000 mark Wednesday morning.

Ether is also seeing a rally as the community prepares for an upgrade in April.

Bitcoin hit a $1 trillion market capitalization for the second time early Tuesday as the price of the world's most popular cryptocurrency rallied to a two-week high.

The cryptocurrency climbed above the $54,000-level early Tuesday as institutional support for bitcoin continues to climb steadily, shrugging off concerns about its volatility.

""The exuberance that propelled stocks upwards in the past decade appears to be favoring cryptocurrency,"" said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex. ""The interesting thing is that bitcoin was invented against a backdrop of massive stimulus measures that fueled asset prices.""

On Monday, Norway's Aker ASA, a $6 billion industrial holding company that controls construction and oil services companies, said that it set up a unit dedicated to investing in bitcoin and blockchain technology. The unit, called Seetee AS, is initially capitalized with around $58.6 million.

""Bit­coin may still go to zero. But it can also become the core of a new monetary ­architecture,"" Aker ASA chairman Kjell Inge Rokke said in a shareholder letter. Rokke, Norway's second-richest person, also said that bit­coin could one day ""be worth mil­lions of dollars.""

NYDIG, a provider of bitcoin technology solutions, also announced on Monday that it raised $200 million from investors such Stone Ridge Holdings Group, Morgan Stanley, New York Life, MassMutual, and Soros Fund Management. The capital will be used for bitcoin-related initiatives that span from clean energy to philanthropy.

Bitcoin first hit the $1 trillion market capitalization milestone on February 19. On that day, it traded at $53,038.

In February, major firms from Tesla to Mastercard announced investments or new support for the cryptocurrency.

Apart from bitcoin, ether also is seeing a rally as the community prepares for an upgrade that will change how transactions work and start to destroy coins.

Chinese app maker Meitu on Sunday announced purchases of ether and bitcoin, CNBC reported, helping boost the prices of both cryptocurrencies.

""Bitcoin reclaimed the$50,000-level after the US passed the stimulus bill, and on the back of MicroStrategy and Meitu purchasing bitcoin,"" said Annabelle Huang, Head GlobalX Center at Amber Group. ""However, concerns from the macro world around rates and [US Dollar Index] have sent equities across the board down, threatening crypto once again.""","A popular destination for would-be cryptocurrency mining moguls is in the process of banning all mining farms and projects by April. The autonomous Inner Mongolia (Nei Mongol) region of China has reportedly been put on blast due to not minimising its power consumption, and as a result now intends to curb cryptocurrency mining in a bid to reduce its energy use.

All cryptocurrency mining efforts in the region will be shutdown by April, a draft plan posted to the Inner Mongolia Development and Reform Commission details (via BNN Bloomberg).

That would see eight percent of the global Bitcoin mining hash rate forced to move elsewhere or shutter, according to data from Cambridge University's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. The region had been known for inexpensive energy costs and local coal mines, which made it a prime spot for cryptocurrency miners looking to maximise profits and minimise expenses.

The region aims to reduce its emissions per unit of gross domestic product by three percent this year.

While Inner Mongolia certainly houses a lot of the world's mining outfits, the most popular region for Bitcoin mining in China is Xinjiang Uyghur. That's the nominally autonomous region which reportedly accounts for 36 percent of the country's hash rate.

There is more than just crypto mining going on in the region, however, and you can read more pressing reports about what's going on in Xinjiang Uyghur, including allegations of genocide from the US, over at the BBC.

Despite China's growing distaste for cryptocurrency mining on the whole, it remains easily the largest cryptocurrency mining hotspot on the globe as of late 2020, according to the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. It makes up over 65 percent of the global hash rate as of late last year. The US is a distant second, followed by Russia.

It also estimates that the total consumed electricity costs of the Bitcoin network is greater than that of the entire country of Argentina.

That's just one cryptocurrency, and one not often powered by graphics cards. That would most often be Ethereum, which is the go-to for GPU miners and increasingly popular due to sudden and momentous increase in value in 2021, despite recent falls in profitability and hash rate limiters from Nvidia, introduced with the RTX 3060 12GB.","Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $54,368.84 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 5.02% over the previous 24 hours.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $51,428.66-$54,813.03 (CoinDesk 20)

BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.

Bitcoin headed for its fifth straight daily gain, the longest winning streak this year, as a pullback in U.S. government-bond yields rekindled demand for risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies.

Analysts who track price-chart patterns said bitcoin’s climb to about $54,000 could position the largest cryptocurrency for a fresh ascent toward last month’s record price above $58,000, and from there potentially to $60,000 or higher.

“Bitcoin is recovering after having logged a short-term oversold reading in late February above its rising 10-week moving average,” Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies, wrote in her newsletter on Tuesday. “Short-term momentum is positive and there is room to initial and final resistance near $58,000.”

Bitcoin’s gains this week were anticipated in the bitcoin futures markets, according to Robbie Liu, market analyst at OKEx Insights. He’s affiliated with the OKEx cryptocurrency exchange, where a key metric known as the long-and-short ratio fell below 1.0 on Sunday for the first time this year. The quarterly contract premium narrowed to less than 1%.

“In a bull market scenario, a long-and-short ratio below 1.0 and a very small quarterly contract premium may reflect an overly bearish market sentiment, often the sign of an impending price reversal,” Liu told CoinDesk.

According to Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of U.K.-based crypto exchange CEX.io, in a daily newsletter on Tuesday, the oldest cryptocurrency was also getting uplift on Tuesday from the continued momentum of President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 billion coronavirus relief package, which is designed to stimulate the U.S. economy.

Some investors say that bitcoin might serve as an effective hedge against inflation if the flood of money ends up spurring price increases.

As with earlier stimulus bills since the coronavirus hit a year ago, bitcoin’s price appears to benefit. “Should history repeat itself, bitcoin will be on track to retest new price levels above its previous all-time high of $58,000 in the coming weeks or months,” Anissimov added.

Tuesday’s bullish sentiment on bitcoin was reflected in the performance of technology shares. Tech stocks suffered heavily in recent weeks amid rising Treasury yields and a sell-off in the bond markets because rising fixed-income returns theoretically diminish the appeal of riskier assets, The Nasdaq 100 Index jumped Tuesday after falling over the past few weeks.

Bitcoin was also reportedly whipsawed by the investor anxiety over rising Treasury yields. But data shows bitcoin has shown stronger resilience during the latest market correction, with the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and macro assets continuing to decline over the past few months.

“Bitcoin’s price bottomed out near $43,000 and the Nasdaq’s plunge on March 3-4 did not trigger the leading cryptocurrency to hit a lower low,” Liu said.

Ether faces medium-term downside volatility

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up on Tuesday, trading around $1,835.54 and climbing 3.62% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

On the hourly price chart, ether has gained short-term momentum, rising from its 10-week moving average, said Stockton. But an overbought downturn on February’s weekly price chart suggests that ether’s rebound may “give away to additional downside volatility.”

A potential support level is near $1,255, according to Stockton.

J.P. Morgan Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket, the incoming debt instrument, is long on MicroStrategy (20%) Square (18%), Riot Blockchain (15%) and chipmaker NVIDIA (15%) with positions in 11 companies total. It does not invest directly in cryptos, according to the prospectus.

The basket companies “operate businesses that we believe to be, directly or indirectly, related to cryptocurrencies or other digital assets, including as a result of bitcoin holdings, cryptocurrency technology products, cryptocurrency mining products, digital payments or bitcoin trading,” JPMorgan said in the prospectus.

The filing reveals yet another way Wall Street players are looking to give their clients access to the upside of a booming crypto market, which CoinGecko now estimates at $1.7 trillion.

The prospectus documents state the notes will pay out based on the basket companies’ performance less a 1.5% deduction – essentially the fee. They cost a minimum of $1,000 minimum and have a maturation date of May 2022.

A search of JPMorgan’s history of regulatory filings indicates the mega-bank has never before issued notes related to the performance of crypto companies. Representatives for the bank did not immediately respond to CoinDesk queries.","A cluster of regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate that Wall Street investment bank JPMorgan is giving its investor clients a way to gain exposure to crypto in the form of public-company stocks involved with digital assets.

The structured product documentation details so-called ""Insight Notes Linked to the J.P. Morgan Basket of Companies with Exposure to Cryptocurrency."" The ""basket"" of companies includes names well-known in the crypto space, including market intelligence firm MicroStrategy, the Jack Dorsey-led payments company Square and PayPal, another payments company that is building support for crypto into its app and earlier this week announced its pending acquisition of crypto security firm Curv.

Other companies in the basket include Riot Blockchain, NVIDIA, AMD, semiconductor giant TSMC (in the form of American depository shares), Intercontinental Exchange, CME Group, Overstock and Silvergate.

JPM stresses in the product description that the exposure provided is not directly tied to any particular cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, and that performance of the notes is not tied to performance in the digital asset market itself. As the documentation explains:

""The notes are designed for investors who seek exposure to the performance of the J.P. Morgan Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket (Mar 2021) of unequally weighted Reference Stocks, which we refer to as the Basket, as reduced by the Basket Deduction of 3.00%. Notwithstanding the name of the Basket, the notes do not provide direct exposure to cryptocurrencies and the performance of the Basket may not be correlated with the price of any particular cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin.""

Per the documentation, the notes carry a pricing date of March 26, an original issue date of ""on or about March 31, 2021"" with observation and maturity dates on May 2, 2022 and May 5, 2022, respectively.

The existence of the structured product is perhaps another sign that demand among the Wall Street clientele for any kind of exposure to crypto, albeit indirect, is ascendant. A digital asset executive for Goldman Sachs recently spoke to this degree of investor interest around the asset class during a recent podcast appearance.

The developments come soon after JPMorgan distributed an educational deck to clients to help them understand the basics, risks and potential of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The distribution took place in February, as previously reported.

(Bloomberg) -- The next leg higher in long-term Treasury yields may come from what’s known as real rates, one of the bond market’s purest reads on the growth outlook.A burst of strong economic readings -- a mammoth job creation figure Friday and now a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing record growth in service industries -- is fueling bets that expectations for growth, not inflation, will dominate the narrative in Treasuries.That’s an important distinction because while higher real rates, which strip out inflation, suggest investors see the economic rebound from the pandemic gaining steam, a persistent rise may hurt other assets, including stocks. Relatively risky assets could start to suffer with the market signaling that it sees growth getting so strong that it expects the Federal Reserve to start discussing a tapering of its asset purchases as a step toward tightening policy.Ten-year U.S. real yields -- as measured by the rate on inflation-linked Treasuries -- are about minus 0.65%, near the highest since mid-2020 and up from a record low of negative 1.12% in September. The last time Fed tapering was in the offing, the real yield flipped from decidedly negative to firmly positive over the year through December 2013 -- when the Fed said it would begin cutting its asset purchases.“We note the strong March payrolls and ISM readings as early signs of a surge in strong economic data, which when combined with the prospect of further fiscal expenditures, should be sufficient to push yields higher still,” Praveen Korapaty, chief rates strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in an April 2 note. “However, a smaller inflation pick-up may tilt the composition of any yield increases more heavily towards real yields.”Ten-year nominal yields are about 1.7%, holding below the 1.77% level reached March 30, the highest since January 2020. Korapaty forecasts the 10-year yield will end 2021 at 1.9% and move to 2.1% a year later. Christian Mueller-Glissmann, a portfolio strategist at the bank, told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday it could overshoot to as much as 2.3% in the second quarter.Most Wall Street strategists say that before lifting rates, the central bank will begin to ponder trimming its bond purchases, a move that’s been a catalyst for higher real rates in the past. Pacific Investment Management Co. said the Fed may begin discussions in June to wind down its asset purchases, while Morgan Stanley predicts it will announce the start of a tapering program in January.The 10-year real yield moved from about minus 0.6% in January 2013 to positive 0.76% by December 2013.A surge in inflation expectations has played a big part in driving yields higher in recent months. A bond-market proxy for the pace of U.S. consumer prices over the next decade is at 2.35%, close to a multiyear high.But the bond market is well aware that while inflation is on course to rise, in the months ahead any notable pickups will be due to base effects, or a comparison to the abnormally low numbers seen last year when the pandemic crushed expectations for growth and price pressures.The March jobs report is likely to herald the start of even more positive signs on growth, according to Jefferies economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska. While it’s early for the Fed to declare victory on its goals, the strong data should spark the central bank to open the door to tapering discussions, likely at their June meeting -- with an announcement in the final quarter of the year, they say.Data from other major economies have also been encouraging. Last week, China reported improvements in its industrial, services and construction sectors for March. The International Monetary Fund is due on Tuesday to release its forecasts for the world economy.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“As the outlook for real economic growth strengthens and the Fed signals plans to taper its asset purchases, real yields may continue to be the driver of nominal Treasury yields. An expected reduction in Fed accommodation amid an improving economic outlook could push the 10-year TIPS yield positive before asset purchases start to taper.”-- Ira. F. Jersey and Angelo ManolatosThe Fed is currently purchasing around $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage debt a month. More insight into officials’ plans for asset purchases may come Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the central bank’s March gathering.Some investors aren’t too concerned about the climb in real rates.If that’s what’s driving the increase in nominal yields, “that’s a positive reason for rates to be moving up,” Karissa McDonough, chief fixed-income strategist at Peoples United Advisors Inc., said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “I think the Fed is happy to see rates increase like this. It’s entirely based on a kind of positive economic outlook.”(Updates prices throughout, adds comments from Goldman’s Mueller-Glissmann in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Bitcoin Cash has fallen out of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies, being beaten out by altcoins LiteCoin and Chainlink.





Bitcoin Cash is having a pretty good week, with a 24-hour trading high of $541.14, an increase of 7.01%, and expectations that it could be on its way up to $850, these positive factors didn’t stop the fall to 11th place.

The fall coincides with the coin officially losing 99% of its value against Bitcoin since it originally forked in August 2017. In the past 24-hours, it traded at a low of 0.009866 BTC.







This knock looks bad, but BCH still holds its own as the only Bitcoin fork to keep a significant place among the top coins. The next Bitcoin fork to feature, Bitcoin SV, comes in all the way at number 29.

However, even in a rally to above $600, this is a far cry from its height of just under $4,000 in December 2017.

Bitcoin Hits $1 Trillion Again

As BCH fell off the Top 10, Bitcoin held strong to its number 1 position reaching $1 Trillion market capitalization for the second time ever.

On Tuesday, BTC reached a 24-hour high of $54,342.57 with a circulation of 18,649,162 BTC. This 8.34% gain in price pushed it back over the $1 Trillion mark.

This milestone was reached for the first time on Feb. 20, as it breached $53,500 for the first time before topping its all-time high of $58,332.36 a day later.

Passing this milestone twice further cements the cryptocurrency as a viable and valuable asset class, which has been long-argued by BTC supporters but has only more recently been warmed up to by corporates older financial institutions. Goldman Sachs recently returned to BTC, reopening its cryptocurrency trading desk.

This achievement has been attributed to several factors. Still, this growth in institutional interest in Bitcoin by companies such as Tesla and PayPal has helped strengthen confidence in the coin.

The current bull market has analysts speculating that BTC could reach $100,000 and higher by 2022. This confidence is further bolstered by Bitcoin hitting these impressive milestones.",

Besides knowledge on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, the ETF-related Job postings by Grayscale require that their preferred candidates should have some experience dealing with the various financial regulatory bodies as highlighted below.

JP Morgan to Launch a Crypto Exposure Basket

Grayscale’s job postings surrounding ETFs come less than 24 hours after JP Morgan announced it was launching a ‘CryptoCurrency Exposure Basket’. The incoming investment instrument by JP Morgan would be composed of 11 US-listed companies that are directly or indirectly related to cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as explained below.

The Reference Stocks in the Basket represent the common stocks / American depositary shares of 11 U.S.-listed companies that operate businesses that we believe to be, directly or indirectly, related to cryptocurrencies or other digital assets, including as a result of bitcoin holdings, cryptocurrency technology products, cryptocurrency mining products, digital payments or bitcoin trading. The weights of the Reference Stocks were determined based in part on exposure to bitcoin, correlation to bitcoin and liquidity. The Basket may be subject to extreme price volatility and rapid and substantial decreases in price over the term of the notes.

The 11 US-Listed companies and their weighted value in the Crypto Exposure basket can be found below.","Digital Currency Group plans to buy up to $250 million worth of shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which is managed by the New York-based crypto-fund manager it owns. For reference, each Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) share is trading at $51.20 at the time of publication.

DCG will use cash on hand to fund its exposure to Bitcoin, which reflects a direct bet on cryptocurrencies as Grayscale makes Bitcoin available to investors in the form of shares. The exchange-listed Bitcoin Trust invests solely and passively in bitcoin.

The move comes amid a remarkable new bull run for cryptocurrencies that have seen Bitcoin eclipse $56,400 for the first time in two weeks. The new rise has helped Grayscale grow from $2 billion in assets under management at the start of 2020 to more than $42 billion as of yesterday.

However, Digital Currency Group clarified that the purchase authorization does not reflect an immediate action to buy GBTC shares, nor does it obligate the firm to acquire any specific number of shares in any period. In addition, the order could be expanded, extended, modified or discontinued at any time, DCG said.

“The actual timing, amount, and value of share purchases will depend entirely upon a number of factors, including the levels of cash available, price and prevailing market conditions,” the company added.

Moreover, Barry Silbert’s parent company owns OTC crypto trader, Genesis Trading and cryptocurrency news site, CoinDesk. Despite this wide exposure to the crypto industry as a whole, the firm was not aggressively purchasing Bitcoin from the open market.

However, Silbert has been a big backer of Ethereum Classic (ETC), which market cap grew to nearly $3 billion in 2017, before falling back within a broader selloff across the ‎cryptocurrency markets.‎

When a wave of institutional investors started to warm to Bitcoin through the second half of 2020, Tesla, Square and other Wall Street whales including Microstrategy adopted the policy of placing their cash surpluses into crypto.

Besides institutional investors, which accounted for 93 percent of the total investment in the fourth quarter, Grayscale said accredited individuals, retirement accounts and family offices increased their involvement.","What You Need to Know Regulators are key to expanding the market for cryptocurrencies.

Eyes are on the SEC for possible approval of a Bitcoin ETF.

Questions remain about volatility and speculation, illicit uses, energy consumption and demand.

Regulation and greater public confidence are keys to the broad adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, according to a new report from S&P Global Ratings.

The report notes the “wave of excitement about cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular, which have become more acceptable as investments or as a means of payment,” but also the limits imposed on their broad-based use due to the lack of new regulations and the excessive price volatility.

Until there is more regulation and greater public confidence, S&P Global Ratings analysts expect cryptocurrencies will “continue to be speculative instruments, which investors mostly use as a store of value rather than a means for commerce.”

Current Regulation

To date, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has ruled that national banks and federal savings associations of all sizes may provide custody service for crypto assets, participate in public decentralized networks and accept stablecoins to settle payments.

The SEC is letting special purpose broker-dealers custody digital assets, under certain conditions, while it solicits comments on “evolving standards and best practices” for the custody of digital asset securities.

And the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has approved the trading of Bitcoin futures contracts while also declaring that cryptocurrencies are commodities.

In addition, central banks around the globe, including the Federal Reserve, are considering issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as means of payment, not as investments.

Once CBDCs are established, S&P Global expects to see their large-scale adoption, rather than that of private digital currencies, as a means of payment. In the meantime, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Tesla have plans to accept Bitcoin as payment on their platforms. Tesla has also invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin while MassMutual, a more traditional financial firm, has invested $100 million.

Will the SEC Approve a Crypto ETF? Canada Has

Proponents of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. are now focused on whether the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a cryptocurrency ETF. It has rejected past applications, but two are pending before the agency: the VanEck Bitcoin Trust and the NYDIG Bitcoin ETF.

Several SEC observers expect that the SEC under Gary Gensler, President Joe Biden’s pick for chairman who has yet to be confirmed, will be more amenable to approving a cryptocurrency ETF than was his predecessor, Jay Clayton.

Gensler is a former chairman of the CFTC and currently a professor at MIT, where he teaches and researches blockchain technology, digital currencies, financial technology and public policy and is a senior advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative.

Canada has already approved two Bitcoin ETFs, which trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and are priced in Canadian dollars, and a third will reportedly start trading soon. “Traditional asset managers are becoming more open to the idea of investing in cryptocurrencies or in taking positions,” according to the S&P Global analysts.","In brief A survey of UK investors found that 30% feel it's too late to invest in cryptocurrency.

Almost a third of UK investors said they would not invest in Bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies, because they feel they’ve “missed the boat,” according to a study published today by the Parliament Street think tank (no relation to the UK’s legislative organ.)

Bitcoin has seen gains of 630% in the past year and a quarter of those polled revealed that they would have made over £1 million ($1.4 million) profit if they moved all of their assets into Bitcoin at the start of 2020.

The independent survey, “The Great Cryptocurrency Report,” polled 2,000 UK consumers in the final week of February 2021 to gauge their investment plans amid the economic uncertainty released by the coronavirus pandemic.

Over a third of the survey respondents said they expected the price of Bitcoin to rise even further this year, to £50,000 ($70,000) and 18% predicted a £100,000 valuation by the end of 2021.

Some 29% said that they would never have considered investing in cryptocurrency before the most recent Bitcoin bull run, which has been buoyed by PayPal’s plans to introduce cryptocurrency to its platform and the entry of institutional investors, such as MicroStrategy and Tesla.

Almost a quarter of the respondents pinpointed Elon Musk’s Bitcoin endorsement and said it had given them more confidence to invest in cryptocurrency. In February, Musk's Telsa purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, leading the cryptocurrency to surge from $39,244 to a high of $43,233 in just 20 minutes, according to CoinGecko.

In contrast, traditional assets, such as stocks and shares, were perceived as “too risky” in the current economic climate by 37% of the investors.

However, 52% said that they are still more likely to invest in traditional assets, such as gold, stocks, or shares, rather than cryptocurrency. And 55% said that they have no plans to invest in cryptocurrency this year.

But the picture is markedly different among investors who already have exposure to Bitcoin.

Another, smaller, survey of 100 wealth managers and institutional investors, shared with Decrypt by London-based crypto fund Nickel Digital Asset Management, found that 85% of respondents already holding Bitcoin plan to increase their exposure to the asset over the next two years.

The FOMO is real.","Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- The next leg higher in long-term Treasury yields may come from what’s known as real rates, one of the bond market’s purest reads on the growth outlook.A burst of strong economic readings -- a mammoth job creation figure Friday and now a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing record growth in service industries -- is fueling bets that expectations for growth, not inflation, will dominate the narrative in Treasuries.That’s an important distinction because while higher real rates, which strip out inflation, suggest investors see the economic rebound from the pandemic gaining steam, a persistent rise may hurt other assets, including stocks. Relatively risky assets could start to suffer with the market signaling that it sees growth getting so strong that it expects the Federal Reserve to start discussing a tapering of its asset purchases as a step toward tightening policy.Ten-year U.S. real yields -- as measured by the rate on inflation-linked Treasuries -- are about minus 0.65%, near the highest since mid-2020 and up from a record low of negative 1.12% in September. The last time Fed tapering was in the offing, the real yield flipped from decidedly negative to firmly positive over the year through December 2013 -- when the Fed said it would begin cutting its asset purchases.“We note the strong March payrolls and ISM readings as early signs of a surge in strong economic data, which when combined with the prospect of further fiscal expenditures, should be sufficient to push yields higher still,” Praveen Korapaty, chief rates strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in an April 2 note. “However, a smaller inflation pick-up may tilt the composition of any yield increases more heavily towards real yields.”Ten-year nominal yields are about 1.7%, holding below the 1.77% level reached March 30, the highest since January 2020. Korapaty forecasts the 10-year yield will end 2021 at 1.9% and move to 2.1% a year later. Christian Mueller-Glissmann, a portfolio strategist at the bank, told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday it could overshoot to as much as 2.3% in the second quarter.Most Wall Street strategists say that before lifting rates, the central bank will begin to ponder trimming its bond purchases, a move that’s been a catalyst for higher real rates in the past. Pacific Investment Management Co. said the Fed may begin discussions in June to wind down its asset purchases, while Morgan Stanley predicts it will announce the start of a tapering program in January.The 10-year real yield moved from about minus 0.6% in January 2013 to positive 0.76% by December 2013.A surge in inflation expectations has played a big part in driving yields higher in recent months. A bond-market proxy for the pace of U.S. consumer prices over the next decade is at 2.35%, close to a multiyear high.But the bond market is well aware that while inflation is on course to rise, in the months ahead any notable pickups will be due to base effects, or a comparison to the abnormally low numbers seen last year when the pandemic crushed expectations for growth and price pressures.The March jobs report is likely to herald the start of even more positive signs on growth, according to Jefferies economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska. While it’s early for the Fed to declare victory on its goals, the strong data should spark the central bank to open the door to tapering discussions, likely at their June meeting -- with an announcement in the final quarter of the year, they say.Data from other major economies have also been encouraging. Last week, China reported improvements in its industrial, services and construction sectors for March. The International Monetary Fund is due on Tuesday to release its forecasts for the world economy.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“As the outlook for real economic growth strengthens and the Fed signals plans to taper its asset purchases, real yields may continue to be the driver of nominal Treasury yields. An expected reduction in Fed accommodation amid an improving economic outlook could push the 10-year TIPS yield positive before asset purchases start to taper.”-- Ira. F. Jersey and Angelo ManolatosThe Fed is currently purchasing around $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage debt a month. More insight into officials’ plans for asset purchases may come Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the central bank’s March gathering.Some investors aren’t too concerned about the climb in real rates.If that’s what’s driving the increase in nominal yields, “that’s a positive reason for rates to be moving up,” Karissa McDonough, chief fixed-income strategist at Peoples United Advisors Inc., said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “I think the Fed is happy to see rates increase like this. It’s entirely based on a kind of positive economic outlook.”(Updates prices throughout, adds comments from Goldman’s Mueller-Glissmann in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $56,248.28 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).

Bitcoin gained for a sixth straight day, extending its longest winning streak of the year and approaching the record high price reached last month.

The largest cryptocurrency was changing hands above $56,000, up about 3% on the day, and within range of a quick run to the all-time high of $58,332.

“We continue to see strong upward momentum from technicals,” Gary Pike, director of sales and trading at institutional cryptocurrency trading platform B2C2 USA, told CoinDesk. “One should not be surprised for bitcoin to test the old highs and potentially break through.”

The day’s gains came amid fresh evidence of two big bullish market drivers over the past year: Bitcoin’s increasing use as a hedge against inflation in the face of trillions of dollars of economic stimulus, and its increasing adoption by big institutional buyers.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, already passed by the Senate, that has been a priority of President Joe Biden’s early days in office. Some economists say the extra money could quickly reheat the economy, spurring a fast rebound in consumer demand and employment that might rapidly lead to price increases.

Crypto analysts noted that the average “funding rates” on the bitcoin perpetuals – a fee traders pay for leverage within derivatives contracts – has started to tick back up in an indication that markets are turning more bullish, the Norwegian firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a weekly report.

But that is still far from the unsustainable level the market saw in late February, which led to a correction due to liquidations of over-leveraged traders.

Trading volume on the spot market, meanwhile, was flat on Wednesday, showing the market has yet to return to the euphoric frenzy witnessed earlier in the year.

“If we think about the volume as energy, and if the buyers only display low energy, then how can they keep advancing the price?” Chris Thomas, head of digital asset at Swissquote Bank, said. “We really need another few [large buy orders] to move us all forward with more energy.”

Ether futures open interest jumps

Source: Skew

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down on Wednesday, trading around $1,803.34 and sliding 1.56% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Ether’s futures open interest is near $6 billion on Wednesday, a 30% jump from last Friday, according to Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OkCoin. The number is approaching its all-time high at about $7 billion, reached on Feb. 19.

At the same time, the amount of ether staked on Ethereum 2.0 has crossed the 3% threshold of total circulating coin supply, as CoinDesk reported earlier today, meaning 3% of all ether in existence will not be available for use other than staking on Eth 2.0 until sometime in the future.

While the excitement around Eth 2.0 and the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 has helped ether regain price strength from its recent price dip, for now ether is still largely moving in tandem with bitcoin, Lau said.

2021-03-11,"As Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) continues its upward climb, many investors have their eyes on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has soared more than 77% since the beginning of the year. Dogecoin, another popular cryptocurrency, has skyrocketed more than 950% so far this year. With incredible run-ups like these, it's becoming hard to ignore cryptocurrencies.

However, they aren't the right investment for everyone. Although they have the potential to make investors a lot of money, they also carry a significant amount of risk. Before you invest in crypto stocks, here's what you need to know.

What are crypto stocks?

First, it's important to understand the difference between crypto stocks and cryptocurrencies themselves. It's possible to invest directly in digital currencies, like Bitcoin or Dogecoin, by buying tokens. Or you can invest in a stock that's heavily invested in cryptocurrency or is building the technology behind it. Some of these stocks include:

Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA) : CEO Elon Musk announced that the company would be buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Musk also revealed that in the future, Tesla plans to start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.

CEO Elon Musk announced that the company would be buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Musk also revealed that in the future, Tesla plans to start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. Square NYSE:SQ) : The fintech company recently announced it was buying $170 million worth of Bitcoin, in addition to its $50 million purchase last year. Square has also accepted Bitcoin as payment since 2014, and CEO Jack Dorsey is a longtime advocate for the cryptocurrency.

Square has also accepted Bitcoin as payment since 2014, and CEO Jack Dorsey is a longtime advocate for the cryptocurrency. Salesforce NYSE:CRM) : While Salesforce itself is not heavily invested in cryptocurrency, it creates blockchain solutions, which is the infrastructure behind cryptocurrencies. In order for Bitcoin and other digital currencies to succeed, they'll require widespread adoption. If Bitcoin becomes widely accepted, Salesforce could benefit, as well.

Investing in crypto stocks and cryptocurrencies themselves can be risky. So before you invest, it's important to weigh the pros and cons.

Are crypto stocks right for you?

One advantage of investing in these stocks is that they're less risky than investing directly in cryptocurrencies, which are incredibly volatile and carry a lot of risk. For example, despite Bitcoin's skyrocketing price over the last few months, it also lost close to 80% of its value at one point.

Bill Gates has also warned against Bitcoin, recently telling Bloomberg that: ""[I]f you have less money than Elon [Musk] you should probably watch out.""

Nobody knows what will happen with cryptocurrencies over the long term. Bitcoin could become the world's most popular one, or it could crash and burn. That uncertainty makes it an incredibly risky investment, and not all investors have the stomach for that type of volatility.

Crypto stocks are generally less volatile, because cryptocurrency is only one part of their overall business. There are plenty of reasons to invest in Salesforce, for example, outside of its crypto business. Even if cryptocurrencies don't become mainstream, Salesforce will likely still be a strong company.

What to look for in a crypto stock

If you're considering investing in these types of stocks, the best thing you can do is look at the underlying business fundamentals. In other words, don't invest in a stock simply because the company is heavily invested in cryptocurrency. If the company itself is strong, it will likely be a good investment regardless.

Look at factors like the company's revenue growth and profitability, its competitive advantage in its industry, and its leadership team. If all of these factors are favorable, it's more likely to be a solid investment. The crypto aspect of the business is just an extra advantage.

Finally, if you choose to invest in crypto stocks, make sure they're part of a well-diversified portfolio. Even the strongest ones aren't immune to volatility, so it's important to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket, so to speak.

Aim to invest in at least 10 to 15 different companies from a variety of industries. This way, you can limit your risk in the event that your crypto stocks take a turn for the worse.

Investing in crypto stocks can be a good way to invest in Bitcoin without investing in the cryptocurrency itself. By doing your research and investing in solid long-term investments, you can reap the rewards of the crypto movement without putting your money at risk.","Investors should explore both digital currencies and gold as both assets can be incorporated into a diversified portfolio.

In the recent webcast, Gold and Crypto: There’s Room in Your Portfolio For Both, Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Global Investors, touched upon headline news that is predicting cryptocurrency assets like Bitcoin will completely replace gold as a safe haven asset. However, there is room in a portfolio for both.

Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin have enjoyed a spectacular year, with ETH up 1,294% since the start of 2020 and Bitcoin up 624% as well. The recent gains come after cryptocurrencies lost momentum and pared losses from two years of sideways trading over 2018 and 2019.

Meanwhile, we have witnessed increased interest in crypto in recent months, which has also corresponded with a pullback in interest for gold-backed ETFs. Nevertheless, 2020 was still a banner year for gold, with prices surging back toward record highs.

Holmes highlighted the ongoing volatility in the crypto space, especially when compared to traditional safe havens like gold. For example, Bitcoin has exhibited a +/-13% 10-day standard deviation for one year ended 2020, compared to gold’s +/-3% 10-day standard deviation. Gold has also been a long-term performer, generating positive returns on an average annual basis 80% of the past 15 years.

Nevertheless, Mike McGlone, Senior Commodity Strategist, Bloomberg Intelligence, argued that Bitcoin appears on track to becoming a globally accepted decentralized reserve, store-of-value asset that is easily transportable and transactionable, has 24/7 price discovery, is relatively scarce, and is nobody’s liability or project. Looking ahead, as the Bitcoin market diminishes in supply with the next so-called halving coming up, McGlone believes that Bitcoin volatility could begin to match gold volatility.

As an alternative way to gain exposure to the growth of cryptocurrencies, Darcy Daubaras, Chief Financial Officer, HIVE Blockchain Technologies, highlighted the blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies. HIVE Blockchain Technologies was the first publicly listed blockchain infrastructure company. The company provides shareholders with exposure to digital currency mining as well as a portfolio of crypto-coins. The blockchain companies have enjoyed a surge in interest, with HIVE shares outperforming both Ethereum and Bitcoin last year.

Along with direct gold exposure, investors can consider gold miners and sector-related ETFs like the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSEArca: GOAU), a smart beta offering that tracks a specialized or rules-based index to help home in on quality players in the gold mining space. The underlying U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners Index uses quantitative analysis to pick stocks, with a particular focus on royalty companies.

“Royalty companies fund exploration and production for miners in return for royalties on what it produces. GOAU is distinct for its emphasis on royalty companies,” Holmes said.

Among gold plays, royalty companies may stand out. U.S. Global believes royalty companies are a superior way to target the gold mining segment. Royalty companies are not responsible for costly infrastructure, so huge operating expenses can be avoided. These companies hold highly diversified portfolios of mines and other assets to mitigate concentration. Additionally, they generate some of the highest revenue per employee of all public companies while growing cash flows and dividends.

GOAU includes a 30% tilt to royalty and streaming companies, which could help investors better-manage common risks associated with traditional producers like building and maintaining mines. The lower risk may also diminish risk since royalty companies have historically rewarded investors by increasing dividends at a faster pace than the broader equity market.

The asset, however, largely trades near the same U.S. dollar value across the market, aside from some countries’ outlying price action from time to time. How is this possible?

Numerous trading products exist in the crypto space, including Bitcoin (BTC) futures and options, but how is the price of actual transactable BTC, called spot BTC, determined in the crypto market, especially given the vast number of exchanges?

“The price of BTC at any moment is really no more than a function of the price people are ready to buy or sell BTC at that time,” Justin d’Anethan, sales manager at Equos — a digital asset exchange under Diginex Group — told Cointelegraph. “That is why it will vary — very slightly — from one exchange to the other,” he explained, adding:

“Naturally, market makers and arbitrageurs will play off that difference and minimize it (selling when it’s higher; buying when it’s lower so that it naturally corrects). Often, data providers and exchanges themselves use an index as a base, which is composed of the current price monitored across a selection of different exchanges.”

Arbitrage is one aspect of the market that helps keep Bitcoin’s price similar across exchanges. If BTC trades at $50,000 per coin on one exchange and $60,000 on another, people would likely buy BTC for $50,000, send it to the other exchange, sell it for $60,000, and keep the profit of $10,000 per coin. A number of factors play into arbitrage, however, such as transaction timing, exchange restrictions and bots.

Filbfilb, a crypto analyst and trader, also sees arbitrage as a significant component in determining Bitcoin’s spot price on the market. “Generally speaking, arbitrage bots play a major role in eliminating pricing differences brought about by isolated volume,” he told Cointelegraph. “They effectively reward people who correct market price discrepancies, with profit,” he added. Filbfilb explained:

“A high volume dump on one exchange, A, which presses price down beyond that of exchange B, will see arbitrage participants buy the cheaper coins on exchange A and sell them at a higher price on exchange B. This will continue until price A and B are equalized and the opportunity is eliminated. Obviously, that is a simplistic example, but it’s going on literally all the time.”

Arbitrage opportunities have also existed between Bitcoin futures and spot trading, according to a strategy once mentioned by Bitcoin stock-to-flow model creator PlanB. The tactic essentially involves shorting BTC futures while purchasing spot Bitcoin.

Certain Bitcoin futures, such as those tradable on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, sometimes trade above the asset’s price near the beginning of their contract periods, depending on the expiration, finding their way closer to the spot price of BTC by the time expiration comes around. This system depends on a number of factors, however, such as the length of the chosen Bitcoin futures contract.

“Buy orders and sell orders from participants across the globe determine the real-time price of Bitcoin,” Rob Levy, co-founder of Hxro — a crypto trading platform — told Cointelegraph. “The markets are all connected — from the spot markets to the derivatives markets (futures, options, swaps),” he said, adding:

“The most advanced market participants, often called liquidity providers or market makers, trade across all of the most active exchanges across the globe simultaneously. The advanced trading systems built by high-frequency traders monitor the order books on all of the major exchanges around the clock.”

Levy noted fast arbitrage as the force maintaining comparable BTC pricing on various crypto trading platforms.

Additionally, the CME’s BTC futures trading impacts the market price for spot Bitcoin, according to a report by Wilshire Phoenix, an investment firm. “The findings of Wilshire Phoenix [...] indicate that CME Bitcoin Futures contribute more to price discovery than its related spot markets,” the report said.

The CME opened cash-settled Bitcoin futures trading in 2017. In tandem with its BTC futures, the Chicago trading entity uses the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate — a value for Bitcoin, taking into account data from exchanges on the BTC spot market.

Overall, although certain factors can play a part in standardizing Bitcoin’s price across exchanges, the asset derives its overall worth based on a number of rationales, including its role as a store of value.","A new exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal seeks a way to allow institutional investors to get involved in the world of cryptocurrency even though the U.S. has so far blocked all attempts to list a bitcoin ETF.

According to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, the Simplify U.S. Equity PLUS Bitcoin ETF would invest in cryptocurrency indirectly via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCQX: GBTC), as well as equity securities of U.S. companies.

Up to 15% of the fund, from New York-based Simplify Exchange Traded Funds, would be invested in bitcoin, solely through the $35 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, with the remainder in equities.

If approved, the ETF would trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker “SPBC,” and have a management fee of 0.5%. BNY Mellon would be the ETF’s administrator, transfer agent, asset custodian and accountant.

In its investment strategy section, the Simplify prospectus states:

The Fund expects to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies indirectly by investing up to 15% of its total assets (measured at the time of investment) in a wholly-owned and controlled subsidiary, which is designed to enhance the ability of the Fund to obtain exposure to cryptocurrencies consistent with the limits of the U.S. federal tax law requirements applicable to regulated investment companies.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the world’s largest bitcoin fund, offering investors the opportunity to gain regulated exposure to the leading cryptocurrency without having to take direct control of assets.

The latest figures show Grayscale Investments – owned by CoinDesk’s parent firm, Digital Currency Group – currently has $42.1 billion in net assets under management across all its cryptocurrency trusts and funds.

The SEC has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF, having shot down a host of hopefuls in recent years. Most recently, VanEck made another attempt to persuade the SEC that now is at last is the time, with a filing in December.","It has officially been a year.

A year of the ‘new norm’. A year of quarantining, of remote work, N19 masks, and social distancing. For many, a year of financial stress, mental health challenges, a year of loss. One year of COVID-19.

While the exact dates that quarantines began in the western world vary from country to country, this week marks the week when the whole world became serious about the coronavirus. Europe and North America had been watching reports on the spread of COVID from China and other parts of Asia for weeks; the World Health Organization (WHO) was warning that a global pandemic may be imminent.

Then, on Friday, March 13th, 2020, US President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in the country; the same day, World Health Organization officials declared that Europe had become the new epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the days leading up to the declarations, financial market crashes, the likes of which have not been seen in over a decade, began to wreak havoc on capital markets around the globe. Oil prices turned negative; the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 6,400 points, roughly 26% in just four trading days.

One of the starkest crashes hit the cryptocurrency markets. On the second Thursday in March 2020, the price of Bitcoin fell nearly 40 percent, crashing from nearly $8000 to around $4,700 in a matter of hours. Simultaneously, crypto’s total market cap lost approximately $30 billion, also dropping a total of 40 percent.

Today, March 11th is the second Thursday in March 2021, one year since the day that eventually came to be known as ‘Crypto’s Black Thursday’.

Black Thursday was Hell. https://t.co/8YkHMlKPlR — Mike Abundo (@MikeAbundo) March 10, 2021

Crypto’s Black Thursday: One Year Later

And, what a year it has been.

When the crash occurred on March 12th, Bloomberg compared the price drop to the bursting of the crypto bubble in late 2017. In addition, a number of crypto critics said that the moment was proof that Bitcoin was not, in fact, the ‘safe haven’, ‘hedge against inflation’ asset that so many Bitcoin ‘believers’ said that it was.

On March 12th, 2020, renowned Bitcoin bear and Founder of EuroPacific Capital, Peter Schiff told Kitco News that Bitcoin is “not a safe haven asset. It is a very risky asset. The price of bitcoin has collapsed by more than the stock market during the last several weeks and in fact, it’s not even a non-correlated asset.”

However, while Black Thursday may have cast doubt on Bitcoin’s long-term viability, BTC quickly made a remarkable comeback. By May of 2020, BTC was back up to nearly $10K a pop and maintained levels above $8K for the rest of the year. Today, the price of a single BTC is nearly $55,000, which is a rise of more than 1000 percent.

What Happened on Crypto’s Black Thursday?

Do Kwon, Co-Founder and CEO of Terraform Labs (TFL), explained that the primary factor that drove financial markets to crash across the board last March was fear.

“March 12th, 2020 was when the S&P 500 and markets around the world crashed from the fear and economic chaos induced by COVID-19,” Kwon told Finance Magnates.

“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are more volatile, also fell in parallel to legacy markets which created the type of massive drawdown that was experienced. There were also other factors at play, including many Bitcoin investors being over-leveraged with derivatives contracts; that created a cascading set of sell orders on BTC-denominated perpetual swap contracts, pushing the price down further.”

However, Steve Ehrlich, Chief Executive of Voyager Digital, explained that while Black Thursday was certainly a moment of reckoning for Bitcoin, it may have also marked a pivot point for the future of the digital economy.

“As real clarity around the implications of the pandemic set-in, it became apparent that lockdowns would go into effect, the digital economy would become quintessential, and that economic stimulus would become necessary to keep the economy afloat,” he told Finance Magnates.

Doug Schwenk, Chairman of Digital Asset Research, told Finance Magnates that the Black Thursday Crash had an important psychological effect on crypto markets.

“[Black Thursday] has provided, in a sense, a psychological floor to build on,” Schwenk told Finance Magnates. “The shock and uncertainty of that moment led markets to regroup… and lowered volatility.” This momentum to rebuild initially consolidated “around $10k for BTC and then pushed higher as continued positive or clarifying news brought buyers into crypto markets.”

After Black Thursday, ”Bitcoin Reached an Inflection Point of Adoption from Institutions.”

Beyond the effects of fear and doubt, the market crash that took place in March of 2020 led to important changes in monetary policy that have had profound effects on the price of Bitcoin.

For this reason, Do Kwon pointed out that “in hindsight, [Black Thursday] was a great time to buy both Bitcoin and legacy markets.”

“Over the course of 2020, a deluge of fiscal stimulus helped contribute to Bitcoin’s store-of-value or ‘digital gold’ narrative that increased awareness of its long-term potential.”

After Black Thursday, “what followed was months of news of the U.S. Government printing trillions of dollars to stimulate the economy and provide economic relief. In fact, 20% of all dollars ever printed since the origins of the U.S. Dollar were printed in 2020,” Kwon explained.

“This massive influx of U.S. dollars into the economy at a rapidly increasing velocity due to lower interest rates, left investors rushing to find the best place to invest their dollars to combat inflation.”

This is what led a growing number of institutional investors into BTC. “Bitcoin, being a scarce digital asset, with a strict 21-million hard cap supply, and its rapid rate of adoption led Bitcoin’s value to sky-rocket and continue hitting all-time highs, far surpassing its previous 2017 peak,” Kwon explained.

“[…] Bitcoin reached an inflexion point of adoption from institutions, who began pouring in money as a long-term hedge against inflation. With the halving occurring in May 2020 after the crash, the supply of Bitcoin issued by the protocol was reduced by 50 percent, which also reduced the liquid supply available to the market, making BTC more scarce.”

Marie Tatibouet, Chief Marketing Officer at Gate.io, told Finance Magnates that this scarcity is making Bitcoin increasingly attractive to large investors. “Every company now wants to dedicate their balance sheet to Bitcoin,” she said.

“Microstrategy, Tesla, Square, Ruffers, and others have all gone in on Bitcoin. Other Fortune 500 companies will probably follow suit and buy chunks of Bitcoin, as well. Now, even Ethereum has become a major investment option, with companies like Meitubuying $22M worth of ETH.”

Retail Investors Also Came for Crypto Markets in 2020

But, it was not just institutional investors that came in droves for cryptocurrency in 2020. Steve Ehrlich, Chief Executive of Voyager Digital, explained to Finance Magnates that: “as people across the world were restricted to their homes, many small businesses had to reduce their operations, retail investors were looking for new avenues to invest and trade for supplemental income – causing a surge into cryptocurrency investing.”

Ehlrich says that similar to institutional investors, retail investors in Bitcoin began to see BTC as a hedge against inflation. Verdict reported in January 2021 that retail investors who put their government stimulus checks into BTC were one of the driving factors behind Bitcoin’s massive price increase. Notably, investors who put their first $1400 stimulus check into Bitcoin now have approximately $9000 in BTC.

“These retail investors also see the world becoming more digital, and the digital gold narrative of Bitcoin has never been stronger,” Steve Ehrlich said.

However, there is still a ways to go before the Bitcoin market reaches the size of the gold market: “in order for Bitcoin to reach a market cap similar to gold, it will have to hit a $11 trillion dollar market cap,” Bitcoin now hovers around a $1 trillion dollar market cap, as it continues to gobble up Global liquidity. And, many Bitcoin enthusiasts believe BTC surpassing Gold’s market cap is only a matter of time.

“In order for Bitcoin to reach a market cap similar to gold, it will have to hit an $11 trillion dollar market cap. Bitcoin now hovers around a $1 trillion dollar market cap, as it continues to gobble up Global liquidity. And, many Bitcoin enthusiasts believe BTC surpassing Gold’s market cap is only a matter of time,” Ehrlich said.

A “Wave of Positive Regulatory Events” Acted as a Boon for Bitcoin

Digital Asset Research’s Doug Scwhenk pointed out that in addition to monetary policy changes and an increasing pool of BTC buyers, crypto has been positively affected by “a wave of positive regulatory events that give institutional investors comfort.”

For example, “the new US administration has nominated a chair of the SEC with prior crypto experience, ETF’s have launched in Canada and Bermuda, and the OCC clarified banks can hold these assets.”

Additionally, “storied institutions such as Bank of New York Mellon and Northern Trust have declared public plans and offerings in the space. All of this has served as tremendous tailwinds after an initial shock and great unknown about how our lives would be affected by COVID.”

A New Financial Paradigm in 2022?

If these positive regulatory trends continue in 2022, Bitcoin’s explosive growth could continue. Now that it has been twelve months since Black Thursday, what could crypto markets look like twelve months in the future?

Do Kwon said that while, “it’s impossible to know,” what the future will hold, “at the current rate, it wouldn’t be surprising if we begin to see accelerated adoption of Bitcoin and DeFi by more mainstream investors.”

“Better UX, more capital, better infrastructure, and broader awareness are all ingredients for onboarding more users to a new financial system, one that is more inclusive and open,” Kwon said.

Though it might not arrive in 2022, Steve Ehrlich sees a financial paradigm shift in the future. “More than just a new monetary technology, Bitcoin is an entirely new economic paradigm: an uncompromisable base money protocol for a global, digital, non-state economy,” he said. “It promises to mark the separation of money and state.”

“Bitcoin presents us with an opportunity to reinvent gold and rethink money for the digital future in a more globalized, internet-native way. For those, and many more reasons, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency will continue to enjoy progress and pursuit of a new economic reality.”

Therefore, Bitcoin could reach unprecedented levels in the twelve months ahead: “originally, the idea of a $100,000 Bitcoin seemed like a complete stretch of the imagination, but has now become like a seemingly reasonable target for the rising digital asset,” he said.

“We see cryptocurrency and digital assets going completely mainstream, disrupting traditional financial institutions, and giving economic empowerment to people all over the world in need.”","Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, touched $57,000 on Thursday after a significant rise in demand from retail and institutional investors. Also, BTC whales are on the move after the recent price surge.

According to the latest data published by blockchain tracker and crypto analytics platform, Whale Alert, an anonymous Bitcoin user moved 5,000 BTC worth over $280 million to an unknown crypto wallet. The transaction was executed on 11 March at around 3:00 UTC. It was recorded on blockchair.com.

Bitcoin registered an all-time high of $58,000 on 22 February after Tesla announced a $1.5 billion investment in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The price of BTC dipped around 20% at the end of February, but it has recovered since then, and Bitcoin is now trading above $56,000 with a market cap of $1.04 trillion. BTC now has nearly 10% of the total market cap of mined Gold.

Bitcoin’s price rise has accelerated anonymous transactions. Finance Magnates earlier reported a surge in anonymous crypto transactions. BTC’s supply at leading digital exchanges is dropping sharply as well. In the latest move, an unknown user moved 2,000 BTC worth nearly $114 million from crypto exchange Binance to digital wallet Xapo.

Bitcoin Outflows

Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, reported significant BTC outflows in recent weeks. According to the latest data posted by Crypto Quant, around 15,700 BTC worth over $850 million left Coinbase within a single day earlier this week. Bitcoin whales are planning to create a supply shortage to drive the demand for Bitcoin. Finance Magnates also reported about the liquidity crisis Bitcoin is going through. JP Morgan’s Strategist, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou mentioned in a recent report that BTC’s liquidity has deteriorated in the last few months.

“Market liquidity is currently much lower for Bitcoin than in gold or the S&P 500, which implies that even small flows can have a large price impact,” Panigirtzoglou highlighted in a research note in February.","Bitcoin’s Demand Remains High, A Bullish Backing For an Ambitious Ride

Bitcoin’s dominance in the market is not about to be pulled down as many analysts have suggested as the premier cryptocurrency is continuously seeing increased demand, from both retail and institutional investors.

In a bid to meet this demand, American investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co filed an application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an investment vehicle that will track the performance of 11 firms including MicroStrategy and Tesla with direct or indirect exposure to Bitcoin. The primary aim of the move is to give more institutional investors a new option to get involved in Bitcoin without directly owning the digital currency.

In terms of the rub off on the price of the asset, BTC bulls are delighted by the news from JPMorgan Chase, but the immediate pressure from undecided HODLers to offload some of their holdings is casting doubt on the imminent bullish runs to new highs. Despite the maintenance of an uptrend with a growth of 3% to $55,580.00 according to CEX.IO price feeds, the bear actions are still visible on the daily BTC-USD chart on TradingView.","PALM BEACH, Fla., March 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Bitcoin was the first and is still most well-known cryptocurrency. People were skeptical at first but the cryptocurrency tidal wave hard to ignore! Despite Bitcoin being well known amongst traders for its price swings, many believe that this leading digital currency is here to stay. The beginning of the pandemic immediately sparked rumors about a new financial crisis hitting the globe with all its might. Indeed, nobody knew how long it would take the world to combat COVID-19. The government started the money creation process, and the US dollar index slid to the lowest level for the first time in the past few years. As the market hates uncertainty, the whole world froze, awaiting election results. Stock market and gold prices dropped again as a natural response to the election season, and everyone expected Bitcoin to follow the same falling trend, but it didn't. A recent report from an industry watchdog, HackerNoon said: ""Money 'printing' pumped up the economy to keep markets functioning. Yet nobody seemed to be thinking of the long-term consequences. The risk of inflation forced investors to start looking for other, more reliable assets to allocate their funds. Here's where Bitcoin came to the rescue. Its price skyrocketed even more, compared to traditional financial markets. And that was just the beginning. As investors always keep looking for new opportunities, while the stock market and gold didn't promise much return, it became a unique asset with huge potential.""

HackerNoon continued: ""The Bitcoin addiction buzz also raised as PayPal announced it would enable buying, selling, and holding digital currencies. PayPal owns a huge payment infrastructure and sets a new trend that will soon be supported by others… the biggest debit payment system PayPal has joined the crypto market, allowing its users to hold, buy, and sell digital currencies in its online wallets. PayPal also said that beginning in 2021, PayPal customers will be able to use their crypto to pay at PayPal's 26 million merchants worldwide with no incremental fees. Aside from this, more and more institutional investors are flocking in cryptocurrencies, raising the demand and making it more promising for others. As big players keep joining the game, the value of the whole cryptocurrency industry also keeps rising… To address high volatility, the consumers will immediately be converting their crypto balance to fiat.

2021-03-12,"There are a number of risks associated with holding and investing in cryptocurrencies. In the latest CoinDesk Research report, we look at seven different risks, from the regulatory to the technological, that affect bitcoin and ether, and whether you’d want to hold these assets for the long term.

Here is a brief overview of three of those risks, identified in the report “Bitcoin + Ether: An Investor’s Perspective.”

1. Regulatory

Twelve years after the creation of the world’s first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, regulating the asset is still complicated in most countries. Officials want to know, are bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies financial assets? Commodities? Property?

As for ether, the questions are on a different level because of the underlying Ethereum blockchain. So regulators in the U.S., for instance, are wrestling with the kind of information decentralized applications (dapps) and proof-of-stake blockchains (where Ethereum is heading with its Eth 2.0 upgrade) do and do not collect about its users.

In December 2020, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a unit of the Treasury Dept., proposed rules affecting banks and money services companies as well as crypto exchanges. Exchanges would have to collect names and home addresses for the owners of private crypto wallets (also referred to as self-hosted wallets, unhosted wallets or sometimes just “wallets”) receiving more than $3,000 in cryptocurrencies in aggregate in a day.

Such rules, if implemented, could put a big chill on those holding crypto on exchanges, and even on users of Ethereum and its dapp ecosystem. Most of the activity on dapps is as yet untraceable, and the ease of moving value around in a pseudonymous manner through the ether cryptocurrency is still intact. There is the potential for this proposal to be implemented by U.S. regulators in some form but FinCEN is taking public comment and industry feedback until March 29.

2. Technological

The risk of a bug in the Bitcoin protocol’s software is low but not zero. The introduction of upgrades such as “Taproot” brings new code to the bitcoin currency’s underlying protocol that may make its technology open to new attack vectors.

The technological risk for ether is much greater than bitcoin because of the Ethereum blockchain’s ambitious upgrade to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. Ethereum 2.0 will radically change how transactions and dapps are secured on the network.

PoS is a highly experimental technology that has yet to see widespread adoption on the same scale as Ethereum today. Ethereum 2.0 represents the bet that PoS will one day be able to replace Ethereum fully and adopt the network’s existing user base in its entirety.

Due to the ambitious goals of the upgrade, there is a higher probability for code bugs and failures through the implementation of Ethereum 2.0 on Ethereum than Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade.

In addition to protocol upgrades, there is a different type of technological risk that exists for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum systems because they rely on the activity of “mining” for network security. A hostile actor could launch what is called a “51% attack” and censor blockchain transactions or cancel approved blocks by taking control of the majority of miner hash power.

(Hash power is a measure of the computational energy expended by miners on a blockchain to process and finalize transactions.)

BTC and ETH Mean Hash Rate Source: Coin Metrics

Given the current size and spread of the crypto industry’s hash power, the cost of a 51% attack on Bitcoin, and to a lesser extent on Ethereum, is prohibitively expensive, but could be within reach of a state actor.

3. Competitive

Another common risk associated with bitcoin and ether is the potential for a more efficient, secure competitor to replace the assets. But while this is possible given that both are based on open-source code that anyone can replicate on GitHub, it is increasingly unlikely.

The main reason is because the size of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks is becoming an insurmountably high barrier. In Bitcoin’s case, the strength in the network is not just from the number of active addresses, which hit all-time highs in late January 2021. It is also from the number of miners that expend computational power to secure the network.

A competitor would have to steal away bitcoin miners with a more attractive and profitable alternative. Incentivizing miners to switch their machines to a different protocol would require amassing similar levels of user trust and market value.

Ethereum is in a similar position. Network effects matter, even if blockchain interconnectivity becomes seamless because the strength of the developer network and the sprawling web of complementary dapps matter.","Today

It was a mixed start to the day. Bitcoin rose to an early morning intraday high $58,159.0 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $59,295, Bitcoin slid to an early afternoon intraday low $55,183.0.

Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $55,430 before briefly revisiting $57,800 levels.

Falling short of $58,000 levels, Bitcoin fell back to end the day at sub-$57,300 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact supported by the latest visit to $58,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $24,751 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Friday.

Litecoin rallied by 9.61%, with Crypto.com Coin rising by 3.56% to buck the trend on the day.

It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors.

Binance Coin slid by 9.21% to lead the way down, with Cardano’s ADA (-8.10%) and Chainlink (-5.75%) weren’t far behind.

Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.30%), Ethereum (-3.22%), Polkadot (-1.54%), and Ripple’s XRP (-2.80%) also saw red.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to move back through the pivot level at $56,880 to bring the first major resistance level at $58,576 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from February’s swing hi $58,321.2.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $59,000 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $60,000. The second major resistance level sits at $59,856.

Failure to move back through the $56,880 pivot would bring the first major support level at $55,600 into play.

Barring an extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear sub-$54,000 levels. The second major support level sits at $53,904.

More From FXEMPIRE:","Four years ago, a new asset class called Bitcoin exploded onto the scene. Since then, a whole sector has developed around cryptocurrency and the process of Bitcoin mining.

Bitcoin mining industry

While Bitcoin and the idea of a social cryptocurrency had been around for nearly two decades, Bitcoin hadn’t really attracted much attention until 2017.

That year, investors worldwide started to buy up the cryptocurrency, and institutional investors followed suit. Since then, a whole network and infrastructure has started to build around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As the infrastructure required to support the cryptocurrency has grown and developed, so has the value of Bitcoin as more and more investors and institutions have bought into the idea of the decentralized currency.

Photographer: André François McKenzie | Source: Unsplash

However, while investors worldwide are trading and buying products in Bitcoin, few genuinely understand the infrastructure that supports the cryptocurrency and the Bitcoin mining process.

The history of Bitcoin

The first real mention and concept of a so-called cryptocurrency was published in 1998. The cypherpunks mailing list’s Wei Dai suggested the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation. It took a decade for this idea to gain traction and become a workable idea.

The first Bitcoin specification was published in 2009 on a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. This author left the project in 2010 without revealing much about himself. To this day, speculation remains as to the true identity of this individual.

A common misunderstanding is that Nakamoto is Bitcoin’s core architect, and as a result, this individual controls the network. That’s not the case. All of the cryptocurrency’s users are responsible for its success. One individual cannot influence or develop it alone.

Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users, which means all of its users have a strong incentive to protect the consensus and ensure its longevity.

For most users, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program. However, behind the scenes, the technology that supports the asset is incredibly powerful. The core of this technology is the Bitcoin mining network.

The Bitcoin network

The Bitcoin network shares a public ledger called the “blockchain.” This ledger contains every transaction processed, which allows the user’s computer to verify the validity of each transaction. Digital signatures corresponding to addresses confirm the authenticity of each transaction. That means users have full control over sending Bitcoins from their own addresses.

The blockchain network gives cryptocurrency payments several advantages over traditional payments. Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain sensitive personal information. Transactions are also reversible. It’s impossible for users to force unwanted or unnoticed changes.

What’s more, all the information concerning the Bitcoin money supply itself is readily available on the blockchain for anybody to verify and use in real-time. By cryptographically encrypting the data, it can be trusted entirely.

As noted above, one of Bitcoin’s most attractive qualities is the fact that any single government or body does not control it. Therefore, no single individual, corporation, or government can decide to create new Bitcoins.

Bitcoin mining is the process that creates the cryptocurrency and it is resource-intensive, to control the number of Bitcoins in circulation.

The Bitcoin mining process

The process starts with the blockchain, where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Each time a trade is made through a cryptocurrency trading platform, the transaction details are broadcast to Bitcoin miners. The miners compete to mine crypto, but they’re also there to help dependently verify and record every transaction made.

Miners race to analyze the transactions and compete to add the next block to the chain. To do this, they bundle up transactions into so-called “blocks.” They then have to solve a computational problem called “proof of work,” which assigns the block an identifying code. That code is called a “hash”.

Proof of work is a process that ensures the information for a new block is difficult and time-consuming to make. It requires computing power, a high amount of energy, and time. It takes about 10 minutes to process the proof of work. The winning miner is awarded the block.

Bitcoin mining energy intensity

The fact that miners require so much energy in solving these problems is starting to attract significant negative publicity.

It’s unclear exactly how much energy Bitcoin uses, but one study estimates that Bitcoin’s total energy consumption is somewhere between 40 and 445 annualized terawatt-hours (TWh) with a central estimate of about 130TWh. That’s around the same level of power consumption as the Netherlands. In comparison, Google uses just 12.4TWh every year.

And the bigger the Bitcoin network grows, the more power it will consume.

The proof of work concept means that as the number of miners is increasing, the puzzle gets harder, and more computing power needs to be thrown at it. Adding new blocks to the blockchain is the only way to release new Bitcoin into circulation.

When Bitcoin mining first started, the reward was 50 Bitcoin. But as dictated by the coin’s creator, the reward is cut in half every time 210k new blocks are added to the chain — or roughly every four years. Today, the reward stands at 6.25 Bitcoin for each block.

Arms race

It’s estimated that today there are more than 1 million Bitcoin miners in operation, all competing for that next block to add to the chain every 10 minutes. This has sparked a bit of a Bitcoin arms race where companies worldwide are spending more and more money to develop faster chips and faster mining equipment.

It’s also consuming enormous amounts of energy. Energy consumption is growing every day and in the regions where it probably shouldn’t, such as China which has a large volume of coal power plant capacity driving its Bitcoin mining operations.

It remains to be seen how much longer the tech industry can chase returns from Bitcoin mining. With so many machines competing for an increasingly small return, mining is becoming a lottery.

But with the price of Bitcoin increasing almost daily, the potential payoff is growing higher as well. However, the increasing cost of mining equipment is eating away at potential returns.

Rising cost

Every single miner wants to find the next block, which means they have to be bigger and faster than that competition. This is driving demand for faster, more advanced mining equipment.

It’s also leading to a considerable amount of fraud in the sector. Buying high-quality Bitcoin mining equipment has always been risky. Purchasing a high-quality Bitcoin mining rig can cost several thousand dollars, that’s if you can find one. Most retailers are consistently sold out, with new stock being bought out almost immediately.

Another option is to mine Bitcoin in the cloud. This requires less upfront capital and space, but it’s also riskier. Fraud is rife in the industry.

The process of Bitcoin mining ensures Bitcoin remains trustworthy and reliable, but as a way to make money, it’s becoming increasingly challenging for the average person. The mining arms race has driven up the price of equipment while pushing down the chances of success.","The rapid rise of Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) within the last few months has many investors drooling over the possibilities of getting rich. But before you drift off in fantasyland and dump all your money into the cryptocurrency, don't forget to add taxes to the equation.

As a Bitcoin investor, taxes can be triggered for a variety of reasons. But not every move you make in the cryptocurrency market leads to a tax bill. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know about Bitcoin taxes to ensure you are on good terms with the IRS.

Buying Bitcoin does not impact your taxes

First, it's important to know that you won't sound off the IRS alarm if you purchase Bitcoin from a cryptocurrency exchange and hold it.

Under U.S. tax law, Bitcoin is deemed as property instead of currency. That means the profits on your Bitcoin are subject to capital gains taxes. These taxes are only applicable when you realize the gains in your account. In other words, you don't have to worry about taxes until you dispose of your Bitcoin.

Let's say you bought some Bitcoin for $13,000 and that three months later, the value of that Bitcoin had risen to $20,000. That's a $7,000 unrealized gain because you have not sold your Bitcoin. You can't officially lock in gains until you sell and obtain the benefits of the growth in your account.

So, there's no need to write a check to the IRS when you buy Bitcoin and your portfolio grows. You'll only need to dive into capital gains taxes on your Bitcoin investment when you buy at one price and sell at a higher price, leading to income in your account because of your decision to sell. This is exactly how gains on stocks work.

You'll trigger taxes when you sell or convert Bitcoin

As long as you hold your Bitcoin, you won't owe any cash to the IRS. But if you decide to sell or exchange Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency, you need to prepare to report these transactions on your tax return and potentially pay taxes.

Let's start off by diving into the tax implications of selling your Bitcoin. If you purchased Bitcoin for $13,000 and sold it for $20,000 three months later, you have a $7,000 short-term capital gain. Your profits will be taxed just like ordinary income, leading you to the popular marginal tax rate brackets that could climb as high as 37%. Similar to trading stocks, anytime you hold an asset for a year or less before selling it, you will have to pay short-term capital gains rates on your profits.

But if you're willing to hold on to your Bitcoin for over a year before selling, you'll take advantage of the lower long-term capital gains rates. These rates are 0%, 15%, and 20% depending on your income, giving you a greater opportunity to reduce your tax bill.

If you jumped into Bitcoin to avoid missing out and the price fell two months later, you'll have a capital loss if you decide to sell. This loss can offset your other gains in your portfolio, allowing you to reduce your taxable income and keep more profits in your pocket.

Then, there's a chance you may want to exchange shares of your Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency to rebalance your portfolio. Let's say you exchange Bitcoin for Ethereum. That's a taxable event because you are disposing of some or all of your Bitcoin to acquire an interest in Ethereum.

Disclosure requirements when you purchase Bitcoin

Reporting responsibilities can get a bit tricky. The IRS added a new question on Form 1040 of the tax return that asks taxpayers, ""At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?""","As the price of bitcoin soars past $56,000, the cryptocurrency's negative environmental impact is becoming harder to ignore. Energy-hogging crypto miners have been blamed for power outages in Iran, while China — a crypto mining hotbed — is cracking down on the practice as it takes a heavier hand with polluting industries.

More such crackdowns may be needed to keep crypto's carbon emissions under control. According to research released this week, bitcoin's record-high prices have created a crypto mining backlog such that, even if the price falls, emissions from mining the virtual currency are likely to stay high for the near future.

The research was published in Joule magazine by cryptocurrency economist Alex De Vries, who noted that bitcoin's energy use this year will rival that of all data centers globally.

""It's the crazy inefficiency of the system that's jarring,"" De Vries said.

Bitcoin's niche appeal is at odds with its massive energy demands, De Vries explained. With bitcoin's usage limited to a tiny number of concurrent transactions, ""it's not really capable of servicing a big group of people,"" he said. ""Despite that, it still consumes as much [power] as all data centers in the world — we're talking about all the data centers that are powering the internet, powering big tech clouds, serving a majority of the world's population. It's extremely disproportional.""

While there are only about 1 million bitcoin miners in the world, according to an industry estimate, the amount of electricity that mining consumes in one year is equal to that used to power Malaysia, Sweden or Ukraine, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.

London-scale pollution



While it's hard to say exactly how carbon-intensive cryptocurrency mining is — most miners' locations and energy sources are a closely guarded secret — scientists are worried. De Vries estimates that bitcoin's yearly carbon emissions are on track to match the city of London's, which is estimated to be 98.9 megatons, according to citycarbonfootprints.info.

One group of researchers at the University of New Mexico has put a price on that pollution, estimating in a paper that every dollar of bitcoin value mined accounts for 49 cents' worth of health and climate damage in the U.S.

""With each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefit,"" the paper states.

Other studies have found that the environmental damage caused by crypto mining is on par with mineral mining. In an article published in Nature Climate Change, scientists warned that if it were to become as widely adopted as other new technologies, bitcoin alone could push the Earth's temperature 2 degrees above historical levels.

""Bitcoin is inefficient by design. This inefficiency is the price we pay for security,"" said Anton Dek, crypto asset and blockchain lead at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (and one of the researchers on the bitcoin energy tracker).

The process of mining a bitcoin involves multitudes of computers competing to solve a complex math problem, in which the first to reach a solution is rewarded with a bitcoin. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult, for instance, to hack the bitcoin blockchain.

It also means that how much bitcoin you can mine depends on how much computing power you can throw at the problem. That has effectively set off an arms race in which miners invest in even more computing equipment that they keep running 24 hours a day. And the more expensive bitcoin gets, the more people want a shot at the action.

""If it's more profitable, it encourages more people to enter this competition — it encourages more miners to come,"" Dek said.

Dek is less concerned than others about bitcoin's potential environmental impact, pointing out that crypto mining uses as much electricity as Americans waste by plugging in electrical appliances that are not running. Most miners use some renewable energy, according to Cambridge research, although more than 60% of crypto mining is powered by fossil fuels.

""We are trying to make the point here that it is not that bad,"" Dek said. ""We also don't want to say it's not an issue at all.""

As good as gold?

""We see the use case of bitcoin more and more as gold. It's something to preserve value, not for everyday transactions,"" Dek said.

That sort of comparison, however, may be driving bitcoin into a speculative frenzy that could ""lock in"" high emissions for years to come.

Bitcoin's price surge has caused a run on bitcoin mining computers, with Bitmain, a major maker of so-called mining rigs, sold out through August, while competitor Canaan is working through a backlog of 100,000 orders. These purchases aren't refundable, De Vries noted, which means that once miners receive their equipment they are likely to use them — even if a digital coin's price has fallen in the meantime.

""All you care about once you get the machine is, how much do I pay for electricity to run this machine? The sunk cost doesn't matter anymore,"" he said.

So even if bitcoin's price were to drop by half, the planet is likely locked into high emissions from crypto mining for the near term — unless more miners can find cleaner sources of power to meet their computing demands, or more regions follow China's lead to restrict or eliminate bitcoin mining altogether.

""You have all these miners using electricity — you can boot them off the grid if you want to. That's an option you have as a regulator,"" De Vries said.

Unlike other economic activities, the bitcoin scheme produces absolutely nothing for all this waste. It is a pure speculative activity of people gambling on the random movements of prices and the only output is simply shuffling numbers around in a computer at insane cost. (10/) — Stephen Diehl (@smdiehl) January 17, 2021

Despite comparisons of bitcoin to gold, many continue to question whether the virtual currency is worth anything. Commentators have compared it to a bubble, noting that the currency can't be exchanged for most goods or services.

""Unlike other economic activities, the bitcoin scheme produces absolutely nothing for all this waste,"" said Stephen Diehl, a software engineer who frequently writes about cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $55,116 to $58,150.

Continuing a strong start to the month, bitcoin bulls pushed all the way to $58,000 on Friday, but they’re still struggling to pass the record high set in mid February.

Bitcoin was down 2.2% on Friday, poised to end its longest winning streak this year, after prices failed to break though the all-time-high above $58,300 set last month.

As of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), bitcoin was changing hands just above $56,000 on Coinbase. The seven straight days of gains allowed the largest cryptocurrency to recover nearly all of its losses from late February, but bulls were unable to push the market to new highs.

The largest cryptocurrency is now up 25% so far in March, and a gain this month would mark the sixth straight monthly increase, the first time that’s happened in seven years. Bitcoin has doubled this year.

For bullish technical traders, the possibility of a “double top” forming on the price chart could be concerning, according to CoinDesk’s Damanick Dantes. “Traders are on watch for a breakout to fresh all-time highs, but there is concern about a double top forming, which could lead to profit taking,” Dantes wrote Friday.

In other words, the market has retraced last month’s comedown only to now sit on the precipice of either a bearish “double top” technical chart or a bullish blastoff to fresh all-time highs, signalling a continuation of the rally over the last two weeks.

“It’s over to the weekend trading crowd to decide if bitcoin should remain at the top end of its range, or take a little pop higher and register a new all-time high,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset exchange firm EQUOS, wrote Friday in his newsletter.

Ether lags

Although mostly tracking with bitcoin’s gains this week, ether (ETH) lagged behind it. The second-largest cryptocurrency traded around $1,743, dropping almost 4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

The Ethereum developer and miner community has spent most of March digesting major upcoming protocol upgrades. One of the largest changes addressing the network’s fee market via Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 was confirmed to be included in a July hard fork upgrade, per CoinDesk’s prior reporting.

For some analysts, the longer-term price impact from these changes remains an open question. “Due to the highly experimental and frequently evolving nature of the Eth 2.0 upgrade, it is unlikely that these tentative proposals will have a significant impact on the price of ether today,” according to Christine Kim, research analyst at CoinDesk.

But if the planned upgrades “become a reality and Ethereum is able to boast a significantly more scalable and efficient blockchain protocol,” the future is almost certain to be brigh and “more value is likely to accrue on the network in the form of new users and decentralized applications and thereby positively impact ether price in the long run,” Kim said.

Besides ether, other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) gained on the week but lagged behind bitcoin. Altcoin index futures on FTX have gained less than 2% this week.

Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are down on Friday. Notable losers as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):

By Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business

(CNN) -- Bitcoin prices continue to skyrocket. The cryptocurrency surpassed $60,000 on Saturday to hit a new high, just a few weeks after it topped $50,000.

Bitcoin smashed through the $30,000 and $40,000 levels over a few days in January. Bitcoins in circulation are worth more than $1 trillion.

Bitcoin prices have more than doubled so far this year, up 107% from the December 31 closing price of $28,987.60. Investors are excited that Elon Musk's Tesla said in February it owns $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet. Tesla also has said it was looking at letting consumers use bitcoin to buy its cars and SUVs.

That sparked speculation that other big companies may soon add bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets, since bitcoin is generating a significantly higher return than bonds and cash. Software firm MicroStrategy has been actively buying bitcoin.

Top financial firms are helping to validate bitcoin. Payments giants Square and PayPal let their users buy and sell it. Credit card processing behemoths Visa and Mastercard are also embracing cryptocurrencies.

BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon have started to dabble in bitcoin, as well.

Investors have been flocking to bitcoin because of the perception that it could be a good hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar if bond yields continue to rise.

Bitcoin bulls argue that the cryptocurrency is like ""digital gold"" and could even replace the yellow metal as the inflation antidote of choice. To that end, bitcoin has surged this year while gold has fallen.

Inflation fears have returned now that President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. There are concerns about whether that much money is really needed.

Some worry that stimulus may cause the economy to overheat and lead to much higher inflation. After all, there are now multiple Covid-19 vaccines and more people are returning to work, which should boost the economy -- and bitcoin prices.

Bitcoin has benefited from investors' recognition that the cryptocurrency is scarcer than gold or other precious metals.

That's because there is a cap of just 21 million bitcoins built into the cryptocurrency's source code available to be mined -- the process of using computers or servers to solve complex math problems to generate bitcoin. Roughly 18.6 million bitcoins are in circulation.

Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency getting a boost. Smaller digital currencies such as ethereum, litecoin and stellar have soared in 2021.

The optimism about cryptocurrencies has boosted shares of publicly traded crypto mining companies such as Riot Blockchain, Marathon Patent Group and Hive.

And cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which has filed to list its shares directly later this year, is one of 2021's most eagerly awaited stock market debuts.

The price of bitcoin cracked a new all-time high on Saturday morning reaching $60,120 per unit at around 6:25 a.m. (ET). Bitcoin now has a 1.12 trillion-dollar market valuation and a dominance level of around 61.9% while ethereum now commands close to 12% of the $1.70 trillion capitalization of all 8,792 digital assets in the crypto economy.

The price of bitcoin (BTC) has once again captured a new lifetime price high reaching $60,120 per BTC on Sunday, March 13, 2021. During the last 24 hours, BTC has gained 6.9% and over 23% during the last seven days. At press time BTC has around $27 billion in global trade volume.

Statistics show that bitcoin (BTC) has gained 212% during the last three months and 975.83% against the U.S. dollar during the course of 12 months. One-month percentage stats show BTC is up over 24% on Sunday.

On Thursday, tether (USDT) is BTC’s biggest trading pair capturing 50.2% of bitcoin trades. This is followed by USD (19.37%), JPY (6.6%), BUSD (5.65%), EUR (5.2%) and KRW (3%).

Onchain metrics from Intotheblock stats show that holders making a profit at the current price is near 100%. The concentration of large holders is 11% and holders time by composition is 58% for one year+.

Meanwhile, as BTC has captured a new price high the network hashrate is also running hot at 161 exahash per second at the time of publication. This is despite the fact that BTC’s mining difficulty is the highest ever at 21,448,277,761,059 (21.45 trillion).

Data also shows that the number of pools mining BTC has dropped to 16 pools as of today. F2pool is still the dominant miner on the BTC network capturing 19.7% of the hashrate or 31 EH/s at the time of publication.

Furthermore, the Bitcoin network has reached a milestone after transferring $3.5 trillion across the world without the help of any banks, corporate entities, or governments.

Bitcoin’s fresh price highs have been positive and Bitfinex CTO, Paolo Ardoino is optimistic about BTC’s long-term outlook. “Bitcoin has furthered its upward momentum amid relatively low trading volumes. It seems like investors may be waiting on the sidelines looking for some direction. Meanwhile, it is important to note that bitcoin is not just emerging as an asset for big institutions and corporations,” Ardoino said in an investor’s note to Bitcoin.com’s newsdesk.

“There is so much work going on under the hood in the bitcoin ecosystem,” Ardoino added. “Layers are being built that could well define how a multitude of payments are made by the end of this decade. Bitcoin is the foundational base layer for this ecosystem to eventually supersede the entire payments and credit card industry.”

At the time of writing ethereum (ETH) is up over 6% at $1,883, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 5.47% at $565, and the biggest gainer in the top ten is cardano (ADA) up well over 7% today and swapping for $1.15 per unit.

After all, notes Suarez, “The highest-paid player in the National Football League” — Carolina Panthers offensive tackle Russell Okung — won’t be earning the most because he’s the best player in the NFL but “because he asked for 50% of his salary in Bitcoin.”

The mayor’s statement may have been a small bit exaggerated — Okung’s ranking as “one of the highest-salaried NFL players at this moment” depends on the price of Bitcoin, as NBC Sports noted in late February. Technically though, Okung gets paid 100% in U.S. dollars, then half is sent to a custody provider that converts it to BTC. But to Suarez’s larger point, interest in a “crypto wage alternative” seems to be growing.

If so, it raises some questions: Why take a salary in Bitcoin when there is almost nothing that you can buy with it? Aren’t there tax implications that still haven’t been sorted out? What about ongoing BTC challenges like volatility and scalability? And if Bitcoin drops 60% or 70%, who is going to want crypto wages then?

Meanwhile, one is hard-pressed to find any company outside the cryptoverse that is paying its employees’ wages in Bitcoin or altcoins. As Thomas Hulme, head of the blockchain and crypto-asset team at law firm Mackrell.Solicitors, tells Cointelegraph Magazine: “I have not come across an instance professionally where a company has sought advice to pay employees a salary in whole or in part, in crypto assets.”

More employee demand?

Still, as Merrick Theobald, vice president of marketing at BitPay — whose BitPay Send platform has a crypto payroll payment option — tells Cointelegraph Magazine: “We are most definitely seeing greater demand from employees to take at least a portion of their salary in Bitcoin.” It’s being driven by the recent surge in BTC prices, he continues, in addition to greater global awareness regarding cryptocurrency generally. “Bitcoin is quickly becoming more mainstream and employees recognize this and want to be a part of this.”

Jack Mallers, CEO of Zap — whose Strike application enabled a portion of Russell Okung’s salary to be converted into Bitcoin — tells Cointelegraph Magazine: “We have seen an immense amount of demand. We currently have over 5,000 users on our waitlist to convert a percentage of their direct deposit paychecks into Bitcoin here in the U.S. alone.”

But clearly, obstacles need to be overcome before crypto wages become the rule rather than the exception. Henry Kim, an associate professor at York University’s Schulich School of Business, tells Cointelegraph Magazine that the vast majority of companies don’t have cryptocurrency in their corporate treasuries, so the only salaries or compensation to be paid in Bitcoin, say, are “likely to be idiosyncratic requests from talent” — Okung, for instance.

Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at Ernst & Young, when asked if he expects more companies to offer a cryptocurrency salary option soon, opines to Cointelegraph Magazine:

“I think it is unlikely. If you think about what makes sense from a risk management standpoint, having liabilities like your taxes and mortgage in fiat currency — dollars, for example — and getting paid in Bitcoin, for example, is a high risk proposition. A mismatch could lead to big problems, especially if you have a period where cryptocurrencies go down in value relative to fiat currencies.”

A more fundamental barrier may simply be corporate convention — i.e., the incumbent payment systems that have been built up over generations. Richard Ainsworth, an adjunct instructor at Boston University School of Law and co-author of the paper “Payroll Tax Compliance and Blockchain,” tells Cointelegraph Magazine that the major payroll companies, like ADP, are still “not thinking about this in a business simplification way.”

There is nothing inherently problematic about getting paid in crypto, continues Ainsworth. “Income will be determined at the moment of receipt. Holding the crypto may give you a tax problem when you cash in” though, and the exchange rates from crypto to fiat currency will have to be kept minimal — i.e., “subsidized by the employer.”

“It is surely coming”

However, Ainsworth expects crypto wages to be commonplace one day, though it might take a while, as is the case with many innovative technologies: “It took 38 years to go from ARPANET [a precursor to the Internet] to Skype. It may take as long for payroll in Bitcoin to arrive, but it is surely coming.”

When Ainsworth wrote his paper exactly four years ago, he was looking at crypto wages from a global perspective with a focus on companies with operations around the world and employees being transferred from country to country. One scenario he imagines:

“If I had a mortgage on a house in NY, but was going to be stationed in Japan, and then in London for indeterminate periods of time […] I might want my mortgage in NY paid out of my salary, along with some other expenses, but while in Japan (if the company was paying for my housing there), I still might want to get a portion of my pay in Japanese yen (or later in English pounds). Getting paid in crypto would ease that difficulty.”

That probably isn’t the typical worker’s dilemma, though — think of Suarez’s Miami city workers. Hulme tells Cointelegraph Magazine that the vast majority of goods and services typically needed by an employee still cannot be purchased in crypto assets, which “means that the majority of employees would likely rather be paid in fiat currency.”

There might also be tax implications in places like the United States and the United Kingdom, where Hulme is based, as “This will likely raise issues from a PAYE perspective” — referring to the UK system that collects income tax and national insurance payments from employees — “from a practical point of view and a general tax point of view.”

Risks for employees?

People need to diversify their financial holdings, suggests Brody, and right now, the only people likely to demand Bitcoin wages are those already invested in crypto. He adds: “Paying people all or most of their pay in a volatile digital asset poses significant risks for employees. The people most likely to take up this offer are also the ones that are most likely to suffer badly if it goes wrong: people working in the crypto-space already.”

“I am a good example,” he further explains: “Professionally, I am ‘all in’ on blockchain and digital assets — my job depends entirely on the success of this sector. Throwing in all my other financial assets into the same bucket is very risky, and if things go badly, that would leave me without a backup plan.”

Of course, there is no imperative that an employee has to take all their salary in crypto. Okung, for example, will end up having half his NFL salary in Bitcoin, with the other 50% in fiat currency. CoinCorner, a UK-based crypto exchange and wallet provider, has offered its employees a crypto salary option since 2019, and even though all the firm’s employees participate, “Nobody is currently taking 100% of their salary in Bitcoin,” CEO Danny Scott tells Cointelegraph Magazine.

Still, this might not be the best way to think about the matter, suggests Mallers: “The most healthy mental framework is to consider Bitcoin your savings account — money that is intended to be saved and not spent on everyday living.” How much can be safely allotted to a crypto savings plan will differ for each individual. Meanwhile, companies “need to be prioritizing their ability to recruit and retain talent,” Mallers tells Cointelegraph Magazine, adding:

“Those that deny their employees ease of use to receive and hold the best performing asset and savings account in human history will have a tough time convincing the most talented people in the world to be employees.”

Among the benefits for employees from providing a crypto option, Theobald adds that employees don’t need bank accounts, they enjoy advantages like faster access to funding, “and they receive the exact amount sent at the applicable exchange rate.”

How does it work?

The logistics don’t seem to be that difficult. CoinCorner, for instance, has held Bitcoin on its balance sheet for many years, which “has made salary payments in Bitcoin fairly straight forward,” Scott tells Cointelegraph Magazine. The firm’s accountant processes everything in British pound sterling from an accounting and tax side, but then the firm converts the required amount of pounds to BTC when making the salary payment. Scott says:

“We take the close price for the end of the month and use that to work out the BTC amount. Unfortunately, this part may get more complicated if you do not hold Bitcoin on your balance sheet, as you would need to buy and then use the rate from the time you purchase the Bitcoin.”

Nor is Bitcoin the only crypto option offered at CoinCorner: “We support Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) too — but none of our employees have opted for these as of yet,” says Scott.

A company using the BitPay Send platform simply deposits fiat into its BitPay merchant account, and BitPay converts the fiat to crypto immediately before fulfilling an employee’s crypto payout request. BitPay also adheres to Anti-Money Laundering, Know Your Customer, Office of Foreign Assets Control and other global regulatory and compliance requirements, Theobald adds.

A boon for the gig economy?

If a Bitcoin salary option were to become popular, where might it catch on first? “Interest in crypto wages is strong across the globe but we do see higher interest in countries where the local fiat currency is highly volatile,” says Theobald. Interest among firms with cross-border payouts “is also particularly strong, and this is partly driven by the need to make mass payments to the gig economy and affiliate networks” that need to make “payouts anywhere in the world, on any day of the week, and at any time.”

From a freelancer’s standpoint, “Online jobs that pay in Bitcoin are a fantastic way to source work from anywhere in the world,” notes LaborX, a freelance jobs platform, especially with the availability now of fully regulated exchanges and wallet services that store crypto securely.

Brody opines that “You will see this primarily offered in countries where local exchange ranges or high inflation makes being paid in the local fiat currency an even higher risk,” but barring that, he foresees companies defaulting to the simplest payment method with the fewest complications — i.e., fiat currency.

What if BTC price plummets?

Will demand for Bitcoin-paid salaries vanish, though, if the price of BTC falls — or even levels off? Kim suggested that employees are asking for BTC wages now mainly because the price of Bitcoin is appreciating — but if and when BTC achieves some price stability, employees may no longer be so keen to be paid in the cryptocurrency, he tells Cointelegraph Magazine.

But when asked the same question, “Absolutely not,” answers Theobald. “In fact, we believe the opposite. If and when the price of BTC drops we believe we will see an increase in demand as employees who primarily buy Bitcoin as an investment often allocate more money on the dip.” And for the more cautious workers, there are always stablecoins, he adds.

Streaming salaries?

What about the scalability challenges? In response to Suarez’s Feb. 11 tweet in which he announced that he was “exploring […] paying employees in Bitcoin” one Miami resident responded:

Dear Mayor Suarez;

Bitcoin can process, at best, 650K transactions per day. Population of MDC 2.7 million

If all of MDC used bitcoin, we'd be limited to one transaction every four days — Marc Kwiatkowski (@fbmarc) February 12, 2021

Strike uses the Lightning Network, a secondary system that can speed up Bitcoin transactions. Will Lightning, or some facsimile thereof, be required if crypto wages are to become a reality at scale?

It all depends upon how a company makes its staff salary payments, says CoinCorner’s Scott. If an employer “uses a [service firm] that offers the tools for salary payments, then they may also offer Bitcoin wallets for the staff at which point there are no on-chain transactions initially, meaning there are no scaling issues.”

“Of course, if they want to send the transactions on chain to staff, then scaling comes into play and Lightning would help out. Lightning would also offer up an option to stream salaries rather than pay them weekly/monthly etc.,” says Scott, adding:

“You could, in theory, stream your portion of salary to be paid in Bitcoin every 10 seconds for example over your working day, so you’re effectively paid in real time, rather than once per month/week.”

Looking far ahead

Five years hence, will most global firms offer employees a crypto wage option? “It is doubtful in my view,” according to Hulme. Ainsworth, for his part, is more optimistic, telling Cointelegraph Magazine: “Five years more should bring some changes, and I think there will be MORE, but maybe not MOST global companies.”

If BTC settles down enough to be used to pay company salaries, suggests Kim, “Then the more likely effect is central bank digital currency development will be accelerated.” Brody, for his part, believes that “Companies will offer their employees the option to invest in crypto and digital assets as a part of their normal savings and retirement plans.”

Scott tells Cointelegraph Magazine: “I expect we will see more and more companies offering payments in Bitcoin in the next five years.” It is still early in the adoption curve, and current tools are lacking, “But they will improve with time.” Theobald adds that it will be necessary in the future for employers to “allow employees to be paid how and when they want to be paid.”

Mallers sees a sort of inevitability to the process: “The public is beginning to treat Bitcoin as their savings account, where excess cash is preserved and protected. The natural evolution is getting a percentage of your paycheck in Bitcoin.”","FILE PHOTO: A representation of virtual currency Bitcoin and U.S. One Dollar banknotes are seen in front of a stock graph in this illustration taken January 8, 2021.

(Reuters) - Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, on Saturday reached a record high, trading up to $59,755.

Bitcoin is up more than 2% from its previous year high of $58,354.14 on Feb. 21.

Bitcoin’s price soared this year as major firms, such as BNY Mellon, asset manager BlackRock Inc, credit card giant Mastercard Inc, backed cryptocurrencies, while those such as Tesla Inc Square Inc and MicroStrategy Inc invested in bitcoin.","Bitcoin is picking up momentum once again, reclaiming a record amid optimism that the largest digital token will achieve wider adoption.

The cryptocurrency climbed to as high as $59,473.16, bouncing back from a rout at the end of February following a previous peak set that month. It’s benefiting from optimism in financial markets after President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion pandemic-relief bill into law.

“Bitcoin’s resilience is proving to be the stuff of legend,"" said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner and co-founder of Nexo in London, a crypto lender. “Every correction is an opportunity to reset and restart the move upwards.""

Bitcoin is up about 1,000% in the past year amid signs of increasing institutional interest as well as speculative demand. Advocates champion the cryptocurrency as a store of value akin to gold that can act as a hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar. Others argue that the rally is a giant stimulus-fueled bubble on track to burst like it did in the 2017-2018 boom-and-bust cycle.

Industry participants and some strategists point to wider take up as one reason why the current bull run is different.

Examples include Tesla Inc.’s $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s endorsements of the digital asset on social media. Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, who runs Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., has said that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of the year.

“The announcement from the White House is very significant for risk assets in general, and crypto-assets specifically,"" said Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, adding that the “floodgates"" are now open in terms of new liquidity.

Share Via","Spending millions for a digital work of art that could be screenshotted feels similar to traipsing around a strip of concrete as a tourist activity. The optics don’t make immediate sense — there’s hardly any appeal in something as accessible as a Google image or street.

That’s my best bet at explaining at least some of the confusion around the explosive rise of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. The token, minted on the blockchain, can give digital assets a unique signifier. In other words, anyone could screenshot a piece of art, but only one of us will own the true, original piece of art. This context is part of the reason why Beeple, a digital artist, had his artwork sold for $69 million just a few days ago.

The reason this topic is coming up in a Startups Weekly newsletter is because of the impact it could have on the cryptocurrency movement, of which there is a growing tide of early-stage and late-stage startups. The popularization of NFTs, as I argued in Equity this week, could be what makes cryptocurrency finally palpable to the average human — beside the average bitcoin hoarder. Platforms that sell NFTs usually need you to use cryptocurrency (usually Ethereum) to purchase anything. Mix that with the fact that humans have an innate desire to own, protect and immortalize their assets, and you might have the perfect storm. Beeple, a digital artist, made $69 million for his work, and this isn’t just a big financing event, it’s a signal that crypto enthusiasts and crypto assets are getting to an inescapable spot in public dialogue.

Ownership as a way for a decentralized network to become mainstream is its own meta conversation, and I’ll be clear that the blockchain and NFTs have a long way to go before they are truly equitable, accessible and hit their stride. But, it’s hard to not to let your mind wander about the opportunities here.

It’s more than a screenshot, it’s about the potential of pixels having more meaning than they ever did before. And it’s more than a strip of concrete, it’s the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Finding exclusive aspects of accessible things in our lives is compelling to a consumer and could be great for creators.

In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll discuss Coupang’s competitive industrial edge, a startup hoping to be the Nasdaq for revenue and Google’s brains fighting Google itself. As always, you can follow me on Twitter @nmasc_ for my thoughts throughout the week and tech news.

The Amazon of South Korea goes public

Coupang, which some describe as the Amazon of South Korea, priced and started trading this week on the public markets. At one point on Thursday, the company was valued at $92 billion.

Here’s what to know: When Coupang first launched, it found that South Korea had an absence of third-party logistics companies similar to UPS or FedEx in the United States. Now, it wasn’t without competition, but it did have an opportunity to build an end-to-end logistics company that is now worth a boatload of money.

The Nasdaq for Revenue

Pipe has a compelling narrative: It’s anti-VC, doesn’t like naming its rounds and says its goal is to be the Nasdaq for revenue. The goal since it started was to give SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront by connecting them to investors that would pay a rate for the annual value of those contracts. It turns monthly recurring revenue into annual recurring revenue.

Here’s what to know: The startup raised $50 million in a financing event this week. In the first quarter of 2021, tens of millions of dollars were traded through its platform, reports TechCrunch’s Mary Ann Azevedo.

According to regional reports, the Norwegian billionaire and hedge fund manager, Ole Andreas Halvorsen, is investing funds into an energy-reducing cryptocurrency mining chip hardware company. The company Norway’s fourth richest man is investing in claims to build application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining chips that are allegedly 300%-500% more energy efficient than existing hardware.

Norwegian Hedge Fund Giant Dips Into the Crypto Economy

Swedish news site Trijo reports that the billionaire hedge fund manager Ole Andreas Halvorsen is dipping his toes into the cryptocurrency space. A report from Trijo explains that the hedge fund manager and cofounder of the Connecticut-based hedge fund, Viking Global Investors, is now investing in a cryptocurrency-focused firm called Harmonychain.

Halvorsen is joining a number of well known luminary investors from the Norwegian region investing funds into the crypto sphere with investors like Kjell Inge Røkke, Bjørn Dæhlie, and Arne Fredly. Halvorsen himself is considered one of the top-earning hedge fund managers worldwide and has captured the 11th ranking hedge fund manager position in the world according to Forbes.

According to the report written by Teodor Stig-Matz, Harmonychain was supposed to be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. However, Stig-Matz’s report notes that the listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange was postponed.

The Harmonychain website has a lot of interesting claims about the firm’s microchips as well. The company is in the midst of developing a “dual-purpose Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Scrypt algorithm ASIC Supercomputer microchip.”

The harmonychain.com website adds:

[The microchip] is tailored towards Cryptocurrency accounting/mining that is up to 300%-500% more energy efficient than existing Scrypt accounting computer systems.

Harmonychain’s Litecoin Scrypt ASIC Miner Due Out in Late 2022, Claims an Estimated Payback of 2 Years

Because the chip is Scrypt the Harmonychain chip is dedicated to mining the digital asset litecoin (LTC) and Scrypt-based coins. The firm’s claims that the chips are 300%-500% more energy efficient would essentially reduce computer energy use by 70-80%. If research and development goes well, Harmonychain hopes to deploy the Scrypt ASIC semiconductors with AI potential by 2022 or 2023. The startup insists it will be the most profitable mining hardware available when released.

“The ASIC is designed as a dual purpose chip with edge AI potential,” harmonychain.com’s website states. “If prototype production works well, we plan to start mass deliveries in H2 2022 and 2023. According to industry standard, customers can expect to prepay approx. 9-12 months prior to delivery. The Supercomputer is poised to be the most profitable Crypto hardware on the market. Our Crypto Supercomputer miners have an estimated payback of less than 2 years,” the company’s FAQ adds.

Halvorsen joining the crypto economy is a bullish sign to many digital asset investors and enthusiasts. He is one of the most respected hedge fund managers worldwide and a protégé of hedge fund manager Julian Robertson. Halvorsen also joins the great number of venture capitalists and well known hedge fund managers stepping into the cryptocurrency economy.

2021-03-14,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India will propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets, a senior government official told Reuters in a potential blow to millions of investors piling into the red-hot asset class.

The bill, one of the world’s strictest policies against cryptocurrencies, would criminalise possession, issuance, mining, trading and transferring crypto-assets, said the official, who has direct knowledge of the plan.

The measure is in line with a January government agenda that called for banning private virtual currencies such as bitcoin while building a framework for an official digital currency. But recent government comments had raised investors’ hopes that the authorities might go easier on the booming market.

Instead, the bill would give holders of cryptocurrencies up to six months to liquidate, after which penalties will be levied, said the official, who asked not to be named as the contents of the bill are not public.

Officials are confident of getting the bill enacted into law as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government holds a comfortable majority in parliament.

If the ban becomes law, India would be the first major economy to make holding cryptocurrency illegal. Even China, which has banned mining and trading, does not penalise possession.

The Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

‘GREED’ OVER ‘PANIC’

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, hit a record high $60,000 on Saturday, nearly doubling in value this year as its acceptance for payments has increased with support from such high-profile backers as Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk.

In India, despite government threats of a ban, transaction volumes are swelling and 8 million investors now hold 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) in crypto-investments, according to industry estimates. No official data is available.

“The money is multiplying rapidly every month and you don’t want to be sitting on the sidelines,” said Sumnesh Salodkar, a crypto-investor. “Even though people are panicking due to the potential ban, greed is driving these choices.”

User registrations and money inflows at local crypto-exchange Bitbns are up 30-fold from a year ago, said Gaurav Dahake, its chief executive. Unocoin, one of India’s oldest exchanges, added 20,000 users in January and February, despite worries of a ban.

ZebPay “did as much volume per day in February 2021 as we did in all of February 2020,” said Vikram Rangala, the exchange’s chief marketing officer.

Top Indian officials have called cryptocurrency a “Ponzi scheme”, but Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman this month eased some investor concerns.

“I can only give you this clue that we are not closing our minds, we are looking at ways in which experiments can happen in the digital world and cryptocurrency,” she told CNBC-TV18. “There will be a very calibrated position taken.”

The senior official told Reuters, however, that the plan is to ban private crypto-assets while promoting blockchain - a secure database technology that is the backbone for virtual currencies but also a system that experts say could revolutionise international transactions.

“We don’t have a problem with technology. There’s no harm in harnessing the technology,” said the official, adding the government’s moves would be “calibrated” in the extent of the penalties on those who did not liquidate crypto-assets within the law’s grace period.

JAIL TERMS?

A government panel in 2019 recommended jail of up to 10 years on people who mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose of, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies.

The official declined to say whether the new bill includes jail terms as well as fines, or offer further details but said the discussions were in their final stages.

In March 2020, India’s Supreme Court struck down a 2018 order by the central bank forbidding banks from dealing in cryptocurrencies, prompting investors to pile into the market. The court ordered the government to take a position and draft a law on the matter.

The Reserve Bank of India voiced its concern again last month, citing what it said were risks to financial stability from cryptocurrencies. At the same time, the central bank has been working on launching its own digital currency, a step the government’s bill will also encourage, said the official.

Despite the market euphoria, investors are aware that the boom could be in danger.

“If the ban is official we have to comply,” Naimish Sanghvi, who started betting on digital currencies in the last year, told Reuters, referring to existing concerns about a potential ban. “Until then, I’d rather stack up and run with the market than panic and sell.”","In this article BTC.BS=-USS

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reiterated the government’s stance on allowing a window for experiments in Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency, and suggested that a blanket ban may not be instituted on these new-age financial technologies.

Sitharaman said that while the Reserve Bank of India will take a call on an official cryptocurrency, while the Supreme Court has already spoken on the matter in its ruling last year, reallowing bank transactions for cyrptocurrency trade.

Earlier this month, the FM had said that as the world moves fast with technology, India can’t look the other way. The FM added that in the fintech space, India led the way and many countries are looking to emulate India’s fintech-based developments.

In January, the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, was listed in the Lok Sabha bulletin. The bill has been slated for discussion and passing during the ongoing budget session of Parliament. The synopsis of the bill reads: “To create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.”

Reports last month speculated that the government is looking to ban all ‘private’ cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, i.e. those not issued by the state. The reports had suggested that crypto investors would be given a three-months transition period to exit the space. Some reports had also suggested that the government may bring in the bill as an ordinance, thus bypassing the debate on the bill in Parliament.","Tesla and its boss Elon Musk have been key drivers of bitcoin-mania NurPhoto/Getty Images

Bitcoin hit a record high of close to $62,00 on Saturday as interest in the currency continued to soar.

A diverse group of firms are now moving into cryptocurrencies, from Morgan Stanley to Tesla.

Analysts say institutional interest is driving prices higher and adding legitimacy to crypto assets.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Bitcoin jumped to a record high of close to $62,000 on Saturday, with many analysts pointing to a new wave of institutional interest as the driver.

The bitcoin price then tumbled around 10% in the following days but picked up again, trading at around $58,000 on Thursday.

Morgan Stanley became the latest major player to make a serious move into crypto, with CNBC reporting on Wednesday that it is set to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds.

Skeptics argue that bitcoin is too volatile for investors to start buying in any meaningful quantities and has next to no use value, putting it in line for another collapse.

But a rising number of firms are testing the crypto-waters. Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that ""this time is different"" for the world's biggest cryptocurrency, because big-name firms are supporting the price and lending legitimacy to the project.

Here's a rundown of some of the major players taking steps towards bitcoin.

17 March: Morgan Stanley set to offer clients access to bitcoin funds

Morgan Stanley is set to become the first major American bank to offer its high net worth wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC reported.

With the cryptocurrency putting up incredible gains and potentially powering a lasting economic shift, three Motley Fool contributors weigh in on Bitcoin's outlook. Read on to see whether they think the leading digital currency is a smart buy at this stage in the game.

Image source: Getty Images.

I love a great brand story, but...

Keith Noonan: I've never been particularly bullish on Bitcoin and will readily admit that I've been completely wrong about its performance over the last year. Does that mean that I'm ready to get on board with the hot cryptocurrency? Nope.

It's certainly possible that Bitcoin will continue to put up stellar returns, and everyone who has seen big gains thus far should be thrilled and proud of their results. The cryptocurrency has performed spectacularly and stands as one of the best-performing asset of all time. That said, I won't be purchasing Bitcoin any time soon because I struggle to understand the bull case for it.

Is Bitcoin a practical currency or a value-storing asset? Is it a speculative investment that could continue to see massive valuation gains? In my experience, the bulls' answers to these questions vary hugely depending on who you ask, when you ask, and how the question is framed. Bitcoin seems to be all things to all people, at least among the more hardcore adherents.

The Bitcoin phenomenon is super interesting, and perhaps it will continue to drive a real paradigm shift in finance. People really believe in it, and there's value in that. At least for a time.

With thousands of other cryptocurrencies already on the market and more getting in on the game each day, I just don't see the comparative value in Bitcoin's open source blockchain technology, particularly when other cryptocurrencies offer faster transaction times and lower processing fees.

Bitcoin is a brand. At this moment, it's an incredibly popular brand, but I'm not satisfied with explanations for why the cryptocurrency should or will become more valuable.

Potentially infinite competition

James Brumley: This is a question that merits a clear definition of the word ""buy."" If you're talking about taking advantage of short-term swings in the cryptocurrency prices, I'm not an advocate of speculative trading, but certainly it's possible. If you're instead talking about taking a long-term stake in bitcoin as you would a blue chip stock or a commodity, that's a hard ""no"" due to one glaring risk: There is no limit to the supply of them, wrecking the whole supply-versus-demand thing necessary to create price stability.

Yes, the number of bitcoins that can ever be mined is finite. Bitcoin isn't the only crypto out there, though. Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC), and Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) are others that came after Bitcoin, and more are sure to follow.

It matters.

See, money (fiat currency issued and managed by a central bank) works because its supply is controlled with economic stability in mind. You can exchange it for foreign currency, but currency exchange merely swaps money. It doesn't create it. Not so with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin's lofty value is predicated on it being the world's preferred crypto. If it becomes too expensive or too unpredictable, buyers and sellers can choose to move to a newer -- and cheaper -- cryptocurrency, and then another, and then another.

The bubble hasn't popped yet, but I fear a bunch of Bitcoin owners buying into a premise will end up suffering once the world collectively realizes the potential number of competing cryptocurrencies is infinite.

Governments won't tolerate it

David Butler: Obviously it would be a fallacy to say that you cannot make any money from cryptocurrencies. You can! I own a very, VERY small position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC), but this is more akin to gambling than investing. There is an inherently high level of risk involved, as pointed out above. In all, the biggest thing that I think investors and traders need to keep in mind is that the further this goes, the more world governments will feel compelled to act.

Anyone who truly believes that these internet-controlled cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will ever become a comparable and useable alternative to the U.S. dollar is being a bit naive. Things like crypto may very well serve as an artificially created hedge against inflation, and a relatively useless digital commodity, and it does seem that some tech firms will try to let it be used for transactions. But at the end of the day, no government is going to allow their currency to play second fiddle to something as completely speculative as Bitcoin. If things get out of hand, you'll see government regulation. If that happens, there's the potential to watch something like Bitcoin's value in terms of U.S. dollars collapse.

If businesses start allowing cryptocurrencies to be used to carry out transactions, I think that will be the catalyst that finally causes government action. The ability to convert money into crypto, and then carry out transactions, creates a whole host of national security issues. It also creates a potential avenue for moving cash out of the country, by converting it into something that isn't a trackable government currency.

Once you start seeing that stuff, and I think we will in the near future, cryptocurrencies are going to start taking some serious scrutiny from government.

The world’s most popular cryptocurrency slipped as low as $58,956.90 early in the Asian session, falling from Saturday’s record high of $61,781.83.

The rally may have been dampened by a Reuters report that India would pursue a ban on digital assets, a rain cloud for bitcoin following high-profile endorsements this year from the likes of Tesla’s Elon Musk, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, and investment giants Goldman Sachs and BlackRock.

Bitcoin has more than doubled in 2021, after quadrupling last year.

“Investment by institutional investors and corporates is increasing. It’s what I call the financialisation of bitcoin,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.

“It’s becoming an asset that investors can no longer ignore.”

Bitcoin’s weekend surge was helped by an improvement in risk appetite in financial markets after President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package into law and ordered an acceleration in vaccinations.

That momentum carried into thinner markets on the weekend, with technical factors magnifying the move higher, according to Justin d’Anethan, sales manager at digital asset company Diginex in Hong Kong.

“The crypto market is derivatives heavy,” he noted.

“A small move up triggered many liquidations throughout Saturday and Sunday, thus becoming a not-so-small move.”

Seth Melamed, the Tokyo-based chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange Liquid, said legislation of the sort India is proposing won’t be an impediment to further gains for bitcoin.

“Because it’s decentralised, government bans or acceptance is somewhat irrelevant,” Melamed said. “Capital will find a way.” (Reporting by Kevin Buckland; Additional reporting by Sagarika Jaisinghani and Alun John Editing by Vidya Ranganathan and Jacqueline Wong)","The Oakland A’s are taking a head-first slide into cryptocurrency.

The San Francisco East Bay ballclub announced that fans can buy a six-seat suite for the 2021, 81-game home season in the Oakland Coliseum for a single bitcoin, valued at one point Sunday at $60,105.96.

The box costs $64,500 in U.S. currency, A’s president Dave Kaval told Sportico in an exclusive interview at Hohokam Stadium in Mesa, Ariz, where the club plays its spring training games. A single game, six-seat box with all the accoutrements goes for $594 for select April contests.

“So you’re getting a little bit of a bitcoin discount right now,” Kaval said with a chuckle. “Obviously it could change, but right now you’re getting a discount.”

The bitcoin offer is good until April 1, when the A’s open the season at home against the American League West division rival Houston Astros, allowing buyers to play the fluctuations of the crypto market.

Bitcoin’s historic volatility has been pronounced of late, with a recent high of nearly $62,000 on Saturday, rising from $29,000 this past Dec. 31.

Suffice to say the A’s wouldn’t be making this offer if a bitcoin now was worth $29,000.

“No, no, exactly,” Kaval said. “Part of the reason we’re doing this is the price makes sense. Since a bitcoin is worth about the same as a season suite it gives our fans some different choices. And it kind of tests it to see if it’s something we’d like to do in more aspects of our business.

“And the other reason is, especially in the Bay Area you see more people discussing or transacting with bitcoin. We’re trying to be innovative in an era that we’re in the forefront. The A’s have always had a long history of innovating, so we felt this is a great way to do that.”

Michael Lewis called the A’s foray into baseball analytics, Moneyball. Call this Crytoball. The A’s have 100 such suites to sell at the single bitcoin price. With about 5,000 season ticket equivalents, the A’s are also in the market to sell some individual game tickets.

Story continues

Seat sales in any currency were enabled just earlier this month when California governor Gavin Newsom cleared the state’s five Major League teams to open the season at 20% capacity in their individual ballparks.

Fans weren’t allowed in ballparks anywhere in the U.S. during last year’s COVID-abbreviated 60-game a season, so Kaval, one of the youngest club presidents in the league at 45, is obviously having some fun with people returning to the stands.

Last year, fans were only allowed to attend the six National League Championship Series games and six World Series games last fall at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, and only at about 11,500 of the 40,300 capacity.

Because of relaxed health and safety protocols in the state of Texas, the Rangers are planning to open the season at 100% capacity.

The old Coliseum, which opened for baseball in 1968 upon the A’s arrival from Kansas City, can seat as many as 45,000 a game for baseball. In fact, the last time it was open to fans, 38,435 attended an 8-3 loss to the Texas Rangers on Sept. 22, 2019.

At 20%, the A’s can expect to sell as many as 10,000 tickets per game. Whether that will go up over the course of the season will depend upon increased vaccinations and the spread of the disease.

“There’s a lot uncertainty about this season as far as how many fans are going to be there and the access to various revenue streams,” Kaval said. “It’s almost impossible to predict right now. From our part we’re just trying to stay flexible. Two months ago we did not think we were going to have fans on opening day. Now we’re going to have 20%.

“So, things are changing in a positive direction. And there’s a lot of demand out there for people who want to go to these games. We just have to let it play out over the next couple of months and see what happens.”

2021-03-15,"Bitcoin (BTC) price reached a new all-time high of $61,803 on 13 March 2021

Last weekend, BTC price pushed past resistance at $58,000 and $59,000 to reach the landmark $60,000 level against the US dollar. The cryptocurrency even broke above $61k to register a new all-time high of $61,883.

However, although still in a bullish uptrend, Bitcoin price looks set for a short-term pullback. The technical and fundamental picture for BTC/USD suggests that selling pressure is likely to push buyers back towards support levels below the critical $58k level.

BTC price downside correction

Bitcoin price will likely continue downwards if bulls do not hold the $58,000 support level. The last few hours have witnessed increased sell-off pressure. After dropping below $60k, BTC price corrected lower and touched lows of $57,300. Bulls tried to push higher but failed to sustain above $58,500.

A strong decrease over the next few hours could see Bitcoin break below support at $57,800, with the $55,000—50,000 range a more likely demand reload zone.

BTC/USD hourly chart. Source: TradingView

The hourly MACD is suggesting growing momentum in the bearish zone, while the hourly RSI remains lodged below the 50 level to give sellers an upper hand. BTC/USD is also trending below the crucial 100-hourly simple moving average ($58,328).

If bears succeed in tanking BTC/USD further, a clear breakdown beyond the ascending trend line (blue) could see prices near the 0.786 Fib level of the upswing from $56,024 to $61,803 high. The resistance-turned-support line is at $57,284.

An extension of the bearish trend could then force bulls to defend gains near the $56k level. A further decline towards the 1.272 Fib level ($54,490) is possible, with the psychological support at $50k level.

BTC price rally to $60k “not US institution-driven”

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says that Bitcoin’s upside flip past $60k happened with the Coinbase Premium Index significantly lower than when it broke above the 20k, 30k, 40k and 50k levels. As per the analyst, this shows that the bull run to 60k, and the new ATH was “not US institution-driven”.

Coinbase Premium is an index that shows the difference in BTC price on Coinbase and Binance. As per the chart below shared by Ki Young Ju, the latest rally came with a 0.55% premium with a spike in stablecoin deposits the reason. According to the analyst, the move could signal a bearish turn for Bitcoin price.

“It’s not good for the bull market if the buying power continues to come from stablecoins. If so, as soon as this exchange stablecoins reserve dries up, we’re done.”

At the time of writing, BTC/USD has retreated 4.5% over the past 24 hours to trade around $58,205. Bulls are trying to retake control above the critical 100-hourly SMA, which could provide for increased buying towards the $59k resistance line. A retest of $60k could set bulls on course for a new high.

If the bearish outlook confirms, Bitcoin’s price could break lower and touch levels in the $55k—$50k range.","Bitcoin prices continue to skyrocket. The cryptocurrency surpassed $60,000 on Saturday to hit a new high, just a few weeks after it topped $50,000.

Bitcoin smashed through the $30,000 and $40,000 levels over a few days in January. Bitcoins in circulation are worth more than $1 trillion.

Bitcoin prices have more than doubled so far this year, up 107% from the December 31 closing price of $28,987.60. Investors are excited that Elon Musk’s Tesla said in February it owns $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet. Tesla also has said it was looking at letting consumers use bitcoin to buy its cars and SUVs.

That sparked speculation that other big companies may soon add bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets, since bitcoin is generating a significantly higher return than bonds and cash. Software firm MicroStrategy has been actively buying bitcoin.

Top financial firms are helping to validate bitcoin. Payments giants Square and PayPal let their users buy and sell it. Credit card processing behemoths Visa and Mastercard are also embracing cryptocurrencies.

BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon have started to dabble in bitcoin, as well.

Investors have been flocking to bitcoin because of the perception that it could be a good hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar if bond yields continue to rise.

Bitcoin bulls argue that the cryptocurrency is like “digital gold” and could even replace the yellow metal as the inflation antidote of choice. To that end, bitcoin has surged this year while gold has fallen.

Inflation fears have returned now that President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. There are concerns about whether that much money is really needed.

Some worry that stimulus may cause the economy to overheat and lead to much higher inflation. After all, there are now multiple Covid-19 vaccines and more people are returning to work, which should boost the economy — and bitcoin prices.

Bitcoin has benefited from investors’ recognition that the cryptocurrency is scarcer than gold or other precious metals.

That’s because there is a cap of just 21 million bitcoins built into the cryptocurrency’s source code available to be mined — the process of using computers or servers to solve complex math problems to generate bitcoin. Roughly 18.6 million bitcoins are in circulation.

Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency getting a boost. Smaller digital currencies such as ethereum, litecoin and stellar have soared in 2021.

The optimism about cryptocurrencies has boosted shares of publicly traded crypto mining companies such as Riot Blockchain, Marathon Patent Group and Hive.

And cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which has filed to list its shares directly later this year, is one of 2021’s most eagerly awaited stock market debuts.","In brief Crypto markets had a record breaking weekend thanks to Bitcoin's surge above $60k

However, almost all projects dropped by more than 3% in Monday morning trading.

A range of factors are acting on crypto's price, including India's alleged ban on crypto.

Crypto had another wild weekend - as has been the trend throughout 2021. In this latest chapter, Bitcoin climbed to new heights before aggressively reversing the gains.

On Sunday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency reached an all time high of $61,700 after an almost vertical surge in price that started on Saturday morning European time.

But then come Monday morning, an almost identical looking price drop saw prices drop back down into the $50,000s. The $3,000 drop represents a 4.9% slide in the last 24 hours, according to Nomics. For global market cap, which went above $1.82 trillion on the weekend, prices are down to $1.74 trillion, resulting in nearly a $100 billion loss.

The movement came around the same time Coinbase, Bitcoin and Direct Deposit all became trending topics on Twitter. That lost topic is in reference to some Americans receiving their stimulus checks as part of Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill.

If US citizens were buying Bitcoin at that time, it would have been quite the introduction to the whirlwind world of cryptocurrencies.

Twitter Trending Topics. IMAGE: Twitter

The picture was no different for the majority of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies. Ethereum followed a similar trajectory to Bitcoin’s rise and then fall, losing 4.1% in the last 24 hours.

In the mid-caps - projects valued between $10-$40 billion - a 4% loss meant you were one of the lucky ones. Cardano, XRP, and Litecoin all dropped 4%, while Chainlink fell 5%, Uniswap shed 7% and Bitcoin Cash slid more than 8%.

You’ll have to go all the way to the edge of the top 20 to find any prices in the green. Hex and Algorand are both up more than 9% while VeChain is up 7.5%.

What’s got the markets so spooked? Bitcoin and the broader crypto market has a tendency to climb aggressively before pulling back quickly. This can be attributed to several factors. The first is exchange in and outflows.

Large HODLers can cause ripples in the market - which are then amplified by bots designed to execute trades depending on changing market conditions - whenever they move money in and out of exchanges.

Movements like the above can be seen as a sign by others that it’s time to hop off the uptick in prices causing a collective dumping on assets depressing prices.

Then there’s the wider economic picture and how it plays with crypto prices. Asian stock markets have had a tough session today as there are mounting concerns the Chinese government will have to step into keep markets flowing as the economy continues to surge.

In the US, treasury yields, those pesky benchmark measures that act as a bellwether for the broader economy have remained doggedly high, adding fuel to the narrative that the US economy is overheating.

If that happens, inflation will rise which could put a curb on borrowing, which could stifle a post COVID recovery. All of these weighs on investor sentiment. The more pessimistic they are the less likely they are to put money into exotic assets like Bitcoin.

Another factor unique to this particular cycle could be attributed to India’s about-turn on Bitcoin holders.

The Indian government is reportedly planning to ban cryptocurrencies.

New reports of the ban have re-emerged after the country's finance minister recently said a ""calibrated"" position will be taken on cryptocurrencies.

India is the 10th largest market for Bitcoin trading volume, according to Statista, meaning measures like the above are likely to have a significant impact on prices.","Why did this happen?

“The only question is what’s the price,” said VP of Barnett and Company Chris Hopkins.

- Advertisement -

Using Digital currency is nothing new, that’s done when we use a credit card or buy something online.

“A vast majority of the money we spend a day is not physically a paper dollar, it’s a digital representation,” said Hopkins.

Cryptocurrency’s big difference is there is no physical coin. The most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin. Over the weekend Bitcoins’s price passed $61,000 according to CoinDesk 20.

“Since this time last year, it is actually up in dollar terms 900%. But we’ve also seen periods of time, where it’s fallen 80 or 90%,” said Hopkins.

Despite its currently high trading value Hopkins said it’s not stable enough to be an official currency.

“The value of our dollars remains relatively stable. That’s because it’s backed by the US government. With cryptocurrencies, it’s not backed by anything. Quite literally it’s only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it,” said Hopkins.

Hopkins said although it’s unlikely cryptocurrency will become our new currency, companies such as Tesla do agree to accept Bitcoin as payment.

“Suppose I signed a contract to buy a Tesla two weeks ago and then I go to pick it up today. I have to go turn my dollars into bitcoin, the price of that car went from $60,000 to $80,000 because of the change in bitcoin value,” said Hopkins.

Some financial experts say cryptocurrency is the way of the future. Others say investing in Cryptocurrency is similar to gambling in Vegas.

“You can talk to a lot of people who are real bitcoin proponents who will definitely disagree with that. They see the future of bitcoin as replacing currency and in my opinion, it’s gambling. You’ve had a pretty nice run how much higher going to go is anyone’s guess,” said Hopkins.

Hopkins said if you are interested in investing in cryptocurrency view it as a small part of your portfolio you are willing to lose due to the high risk.

Hopkins also added a major success from cryptocurrency is with Blockchain technology which helps keeps information secure.","Bitcoin retreated from record highs on Monday as one of the world’s biggest economies reportedly considered banning cryptocurrency altogether.

The world’s largest and oldest digital currency was trading at $56,626.27 as of 11:14 a.m., down 5.7 percent from a day earlier and 8 percent below the all-time high of $61,556.59 it reached on Saturday, CoinDesk data show.

The dip followed a report that India would propose a law making it illegal to possess, trade or issue any cryptocurrency, which would cut off access to a massive market for the burgeoning crypto industry.

If it’s enacted, the measure would give India one of the world’s strictest policies against cryptocurrency as officials there look to build a framework for an official digital currency, according to the Sunday Reuters report, which cited a senior government official.

“It looks like the plans by the Indian government to criminalize cryptocurrencies is forcing at least some investors to pull out of this market, at least for now,” said Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com.

“It’s still a plan… and plans can change,” he added. “We’ll have to see what finally comes out.”

The threats of a crackdown haven’t stopped cryptocurrencies from gaining popularity in India, where 8 million investors hold about $1.4 billion worth of the digital assets, the news agency said.

But fears of a ban nevertheless dampened a rally that drove bitcoin past the $60,000 mark for the first time over the weekend.

That surge came after President Biden signed his signature $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that will deliver a third round of direct payments to millions of Americans.

“I believe the expectations of new stimulus checks is one of the biggest factors in the surge of [Bitcoin] over the weekend along with historically thinner volumes over the weekend,” said Anthony Denier, CEO of the trading platform Webull.

The massive COVID-19 relief spending has some on Wall Street worried about inflation, from which a growing number of institutional investors think bitcoin offers some protection.

That mainstream adoption has helped bitcoin’s price explode by about 96 percent so far this year even despite Monday’s drop, according to CoinDesk data.

The trillion-dollar coin has also gotten a boost from companies such as Tesla and Square that have added bitcoin to their corporate balance sheets, as well as financial institutions that plan to offer more support for cryptocurrencies, such as Mastercard and BNY Mellon.

With Post wires","If you’ve been thinking about entering the world of cryptocurrency but don’t know much about it, you’ve come to the right place.

Below is a beginner’s guide on what it is, how it works, the cryptocurrencies that have the largest market capitalization (total value), how to invest and more worthwhile information.

Here’s everything you need to know about cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to be used over the internet, according to Coinbase. It’s decentralized, meaning it isn’t controlled by the government or any other central authority such as a bank.

You can use cryptocurrency to buy products from retailers who accept it as payment, such as Overstock, or sell it to make a profit.

All transactions are made secure and vetted by a technology called blockchain, which records digital assets in real time using code. Most cryptocurrencies have their own blockchain.

There is currently over 8,000 different types of cryptocurrency, according to CoinMarketCap.

These are currently the 10 largest cryptocurrencies to trade by market capitalization, according to real-time data tracked by CoinMarketCap (Note: market capitalization is constantly changing).

Bitcoin (BTC): $1 trillion Ethereum (ETH): $202.9 billion Binance Coin (BNB): $39.2 billion Tether (USDT): $38.5 billion Cardano (ADA): $35.8 billion Polkadot (DOT): $31.6 billion XRP (XRP): $19.8 billion Uniswap (UNI): $15.4 billion Litecoin (LTC): $13.2 billion Chainlink (LINK): $11.1 billion

Bitcoin is currently the largest cryptocurrency and the first to be widely adopted, according to Coinbase. It was created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or team.

To invest, you don’t have to buy one entire Bitcoin, you can buy just a fraction. One Bitcoin is currently worth over $56,000.

Tesla, the American electric vehicle and clean energy company, recently made headlines by investing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, according to its recent SEC filing, and plans to accept it as a form of payment “in the near future.”

As for Dogecoin, another form of cryptocurrency, it’s nowhere near the same market capitalization as Bitcoin, but it’s still wildly popular. One Dogecoin is currently worth only $0.05, which makes it so desirable. It has a market capitalization of $7.2 billion.

Dogecoin was originally created as a parody cryptocurrency in 2013 by Adobe employee Jackson Palmer and software engineer Billy Markus, according to a report by CoinDesk. It’s a play on the popular internet meme of a Japanese Shiba Inu branded as “doge.” Its non-serious vibe caused it to become a hit and attract a huge following.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also a fan of Dogecoin and frequently tweets about the crypto.

For starters, you need to sign up for a platform that allows you to purchase and exchange cryptocurrency.

Here are some options to get you started:

If you’re not comfortable storing cryptocurrency through an online wallet, the best way you can protect yourself from hackers is to purchase a hardware wallet, which is similar to a USB drive.

A hardware wallet stores private keys (passwords) through a thumb-drive device, which you only connect to your computer when you want to access your crypto, according to Coinbase. As for online wallets, private keys are stored in an app or other software.

Here are some hardware wallets you can purchase to protect your crypto from hackers:

Overstock became the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin in 2014, according to a report by CoinDesk.

The online retailer partnered with Coinbase to enable Bitcoin as a form of payment. For more information, check out Overstock’s help page here.

Overstock also has a “Bitcoin Bestsellers” page, which is what their customers “love to buy with Bitcoin.”

The following categories are a part of Overstock’s “Bitcoin Bestsellers”:

Bitcoin dropped Monday as traders eased up on stimulus-fueled bets that had powered the digital token to a fresh record over the weekend.

The largest cryptocurrency slumped by as much as 9.2% before trading at $56,131 as of 1:04 p.m. in New York, after topping out at $61,742 on Saturday. Bitcoin reached its latest all-time high on optimism that some of the pandemic relief payments in the U.S. will end up chasing the digital token’s towering rally.

“The stimulus news was bid up by everyone in the Bitcoin world over the weekend,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for Arca, an investment management firm specializing in digital assets, said in a phone interview. “Then we came in last night, futures were flat, 10-year was flat, and all of a sudden that started to unwind because there wasn’t nearly as much of a bullish overtone as some of the Bitcoin traders thought there might be.”

Dorman also pointed out how leverage in crypto markets can lead to selling pressure amid broader declines.

“There’s just an insane amount of leverage in the system at all times,” he said. “During any period of exuberance, you see investors borrowing to lever up, and over the weekend we saw all the risk metrics we watch start to really get frothy. Generally, when that starts to happen, it’s only a matter of time before the slightest hiccup starts to liquidate those levered positions.”

The lively debate over the scope for more stimulus-fueled gains, and whether it’s even possible to work out a long-term value for Bitcoin, continues apace. The token has climbed more than 1,000% in the past year, pushed higher by signs of increased institutional and corporate interest alongside the usual speculative demand.

Crypto has seen “some good flow, with traders front running U.S. stimulus checks,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group Ltd., wrote in a note, adding Bitcoin needs to stay above the previous high of just over $58,000 to bolster confidence in a “new bull leg.”

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Pte, and Matt Maley of Miller Tabak + Co both see the potential for further gains based on some recent chart patterns. Bitcoin could rally toward $75,000 “very quickly,” Maley said. Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone has said $100,000 could be the next threshold.

The fortunes of a range of companies are increasingly tied to the cryptocurrency, from listed Bitcoin miners and brokers to firms that have invested in the token.

For instance, the correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and an equal-weighted basket of five stocks which have announced investments in the digital currency — Tesla Inc., MicroStrategy Inc., Square Inc., Meitu Inc. and Aker ASA — has surged to an average of 0.72 this year from 0.26 in 2020.

Crypto watchers are trying to gauge the outlook. Greg Waisman, the co-founder of the global payment network Mercuryo, said in emailed comments Sunday there is some recent “whale activity,” where coins from 2013 were being moved for the first time. Such events, he said, usually lead to selloffs."
2021-03-16,"WILMINGTON – While most Americans continue to use tried-and-true dollar bills to pay for goods and services, a growing number of institutions, investors and academics are studying whether that paper currency will become a thing of the past.

Cryptocurrency, or secure, traceable digital currency like the leading Bitcoin, has become a hot topic on Wall Street and among bankers worldwide. It’s an entirely intangible asset, meaning you won’t find stacks of “coins” stored away in a vault, but proponents argue that all countries now utilize intrinsic fiat currency. The United States was the last nation to drop all parts of the gold standard in the ‘70s.

Tangible or not, Bitcoin’s value has spiked from about $5,000 per coin a year ago to more than $55,000 as of March 10. Its total market value crossed $1 trillion for the first time this year. A March client survey by Goldman Sachs showed that 40% of respondents held cryptocurrency and nearly two-thirds of them expected to invest more in the next two years.

With those retail gains, more of corporate America is coming around to the idea, and even investing large sums of reserves in cryptocurrency. Electric automaker Tesla, led by top cryptocurrency proponent Elon Musk, bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin in February. Online payment service Square, led by another tech savant, Jack Dorsey, who is also CEO of Twitter, made a $220 million investment.

The first major company to invest in bitcoin was business-intelligence software company MicroStrategy – which actually got its start in Delaware serving DuPont before branching out and moving to Virginia in the ‘90s. Last summer, MicroStrategy announced a plan to invest heavily in bitcoin, and even issued debt to continue buying. To date, it has invested about $2.19 billion and become an outspoken proponent of cryptocurrency.

For all that growing retail and corporate acceptance though, many policy leaders and institutional investors remain skeptical.

Last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called Bitcoin a “highly speculative asset,” voicing concerns over its sometimes-illicit uses and large environmental impact to “mine” the currency – to limit the number of bitcoins in circulation, users have to complete complicated mathematical equations using computer server farms that consume a huge amount of power.

Most large hedge funds have not taken positions in cryptocurrency, worried about the seesawing values that can hit the market. Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that track stocks and commodities as a class are also currently prohibited from tracking cryptocurrencies under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, limiting investment opportunities.

What’s next?

John Collins, founder of First State Fintech Lab, a nonprofit dedicated to nurturing the fintech ecosystem in Delaware, said that despite its increasing attention in financial media and its rising investments, he still sees cryptocurrency as a burgeoning niche product.

“One trillion dollars is certainly nothing to sneeze at, but it’s still pretty small when looking at a global asset class,” he said.

Collins has seen the industry grow from its earliest days. As a senior professional staffer for the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs under then-Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), Collins helped lead the first Congressional hearing on digital currencies in 2013. In leaving public service, he became the first head of policy at Coinbase, the world’s second-largest digital currency exchange by volume.

While individual retail investors have largely been responsible for driving up the value of cryptocurrencies to date, Collins said that the biggest hurdle to future growth is the acceptance by institutional investors like hedge funds that have more dollars in play.

“That’s really what’s going to move the market,” he said.

While investments by Tesla and Square grab the attention of Wall Street, Collins said the more interesting news in his opinion was investment bank BNY Mellon’s recent decision to begin holding custody of customers’ cryptocurrency assets.

Banks have long been wary of keeping such volatile assets on their books, even though the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ruled last summer that they legally could.

“There’s probably no older old-school, white-shoe bank than BNY Mellon, and for them to make that decision even a few years ago would have been totally unexpected,” he said. “A lot of banks were totally shying away from even banking cryptocurrency companies, let alone holding cryptocurrency on their books themselves.”

Right for personal portfolios?

James Lee, a certified financial planner and futurist who founded the Wilmington-based wealth management firm StratFi and has been researching and writing about cryptocurrency since 2017, recommends that his clients invest a small part of their portfolio in the assets, typically 2% to 3%, simply because there is an enormous growth potential.

“If you go less than that, it doesn’t matter, and if you go more than that, then the tail starts wagging the dog. It’s just a tremendously volatile asset,” he said, noting Bitcoin lost 80% of its value in 2018. “You should only buy crypto with money that you’re willing to walk away from.”

Lee personally holds Ethereum, the second most-popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, because he believes its underpinning technology has a brighter future.

“It does have a place in portfolios, one as a hedge against inflation and two as a hedge against the future, with technology change,” he said.

Not everyone is convinced though. New York University economics professor Nouriel Roubini has been one of cryptocurrencies’ biggest critics, warning Congress in 2018 that it was “the mother of all scams.”

His position hasn’t changed despite Bitcoin’s rapidly increasing valuation, writing in February that bitcoin was a bubble waiting to burst. Citing its lack of uses, reliance on overseas “mining” outfits, and concerns about system safety, Roubini decried Bitcoin’s value to investors.

“Risky, volatile bitcoin doesn’t belong in the portfolios of serious institutional investors. Many of its retail backers are suckers being manipulated by an army of self-serving insiders and snake oil salesmen,” he wrote in a Financial Times column. “Tesla’s Elon Musk and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor may be betting the house on bitcoin. That doesn’t mean you should.”

Can Bitcoin replace dollars?

As research on cryptocurrency continues, more nations are exploring the creation of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, essentially a government-backed, centralized digital version of fiat. China and Sweden are among those furthest along in their development of such digital money, and America is largely trailing its peers.

In February, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the American public would be engaged on the issue starting later this year, and Treasury Secretary Yellen has been supportive of the idea.

Although discussions around CBDCs are evolving, Collins noted that many people already conduct their banking online and wholesale transactions between banks occur digitally as well. With payment products like PayPal, Venmo, Zelle and others growing, many people may not even notice the change to CBDC.

The advent of a central digital currency would not likely spell the end of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin though. Lee and Collins agree that the biggest potential for cryptocurrency comes from the idea of decentralized finance, or banking done without the need for banks.

“There’s a parallel financial system being built around cryptocurrency that at some point could do everything that our current financial system does. And that’s huge,” Lee said.

Many cryptocurrency investors liken the future of Bitcoin to gold, a relatively stable, high-value asset that isn’t traded often. For now though, Lee likens Bitcoin to a “sandbox.”

“We’re letting the kids play in the sandbox so that they can make mistakes and grow. We’re sort of keeping it segregated from the rest of the world, so that we can put a fence around any of the accidents that happen,” he said.

While Bitcoin is the most-tracked cryptocurrency today, Lee said that other coins under development right now will likely one day become more important. Bitcoin’s architecture, which puts an emphasis on transparency and traceability via blockchain technology, is not well-suited for daily transactions, he said.

“For every transaction that’s made on a blockchain, another link is added to the chain. So for every stick of gum purchased, that system is going to have a phone book that goes with it for purchasing,” he said.

In order to be competitive with a Visa or MasterCard, a cryptocurrency will have to process 50,000 or 60,000 transactions per second, Lee said. Some cryptocurrencies under development may one day reach that threshold, “but they’re not ready for primetime yet.”

Both Collins and Lee agree that Bitcoin won’t be the final word on cryptocurrency, but rather the starting point.

“It’s not going to be the most useful cryptocurrency in five to 10 years, there’s going to be other things that are better and more exciting,” Lee said.","Cryptocurrency prices have surged this year, with Bitcoin now up by around 90% since early January, trading at levels of around $55k currently. However, Bitcoin looks quite risky at current levels due to a couple of factors. With Covid-19 cases on the decline, the economic outlook is improving and bond yields are also on the rise. Considering this, investors are likely to start moving funds back to real-economy sectors, and non-productive assets such as Bitcoin, which rallied big through the pandemic, could be impacted.

[Updated 1/20/2021] Cryptocurrency Stocks

Bitcoin prices have surged by more than 50% over the last month and remain up by about 4x over the 12 months, due to higher retail and institutional interest. That being said, Bitcoin remains a risky investment, given its relative lack of utility and extremely high volatility. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks – which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have some exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain – could be a safer way to play the crypto space, without betting on individual currencies. The theme has done well, rallying by over 100% over the last year. Below is a bit more about the key companies in the theme and how they have been faring.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock saw big gains over 2020, driven by growing demand for its GPUs from gaming consoles and data centers and its planned acquisition of CPU designer ARM. The company recently indicated that it could restart the production of dedicated crypto mining GPUs, which essentially remove the video outputs that are required for gaming.

Square (SQ) a payments company, allows users to buy and sell bitcoin via its Cash mobile payment application. The company said that bitcoin-related Revenue surged by about 8x over the first nine months of 2020 to around $2.8 billion.

PayPal (PYPL) a large online payments processor has also reported increasing engagement on its PayPay mobile app after it introduced support for bitcoin last October, with about half its crypto users opening the PayPal app daily.

CME Group (CME) the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange, also offers bitcoin futures contracts. The exchange has emerged as the world’s largest futures exchange for Bitcoin, with open interest – contracts traded but not squared off – for the cryptocurrency standing at $2.1 billion.

[Updated 12/7/2020] How Nvidia, Square & PayPal Stocks Are Benefiting From Soaring Bitcoin Prices



Bitcoin prices have surged by over 160% year-to-date, driven by multiple factors including higher institutional interest, fintech companies Paypal and Square’s moves into the crypto space, and also by a view that scarce digital currency could be a hedge against inflation and a weakening U.S. dollar. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks – which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have some exposure to the cryptocurrency space – is up a solid 110% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by just about 14% over the same period. Key stocks in our theme include Square (SQ), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and CME Group (CME).

Although crypto likely represents a small portion of these company’s revenues at the moment, it does have the potential to be big. For example, Payment apps Square and PayPal, who make money by buying bitcoin from brokers and selling them to their customers by adding a “spread” stand to benefit as prices and volumes rise. Square’s Cash App generated about $1.63 billion in Bitcoin-related sales in Q3 2020, an 11x jump year-over-year. Similarly, Nvidia (NVDA) also benefits from demand for its top-of-the-line GPUs such as the Ampere lineup from cryptocurrency miners.

[Updated 10/29/2020] Cryptocurrency Stocks To Watch

Interest in cryptocurrency is surging once again with Bitcoin prices up by almost 30% over the last month, driven by growing institutional interest and Paypal’s recent move to allow its customers to buy and sell certain cryptocurrencies. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks – which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have some exposure to the cryptocurrency space – is up 88% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by just about 5% over the same period. This theme could be of interest to investors who are looking for upside from cryptocurrency adoption and prices, but want to avoid buying into the currencies themselves considering the volatility, risk of fraud, or cyber theft, or potential portfolio mandates. Below is a bit more about the stocks in our theme and how they have fared this year.

Square (SQ) cash mobile wallet app has emerged as a very popular way for people to buy and sell Bitcoin. The stock has gained a whopping 183% year-to-date, as investors bet that Square’s digital payment solutions will continue to gain traction through and post Covid-19. The stock has dropped by about -9% over the last 5 trading days, however.

Nvidia (NVDA) a semiconductor company that is best known for its graphic processing units (GPU) which are increasingly used in machine learning and AI, is also finding application in bitcoin mining. The stock has gained over 131% year to date although it declined by about -3% over the last week.

PayPal (PYPL) a large online payments processor, has indicated that it would allow customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum directly within its PayPal and Venmo app. The stock is up by 88% this year and was down by about -1% over the last 5 trading days.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a semiconductor major that makes CPUs and GPUs, which are increasingly used in bitcoin mining. The stock has gained about 79% year-to-date and remained largely flat over the last 5 trading days.

CME Group (CME) the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange, also offers bitcoin futures contracts. The stock is down by about -18% year-to-date and declined by about -2% over the last week.

While crypto stocks look attractive, 2020 has also created many pricing discontinuities that can offer attractive trading opportunities. For example, you’ll be surprised how the stock valuation for Adobe vs. Corcept Therapeutics shows a disconnect with their relative operational growth.

See How It’s Powering New Collaboration and What-Ifs For CFOs and Finance Teams | Product, R&D, and Marketing Teams","South Africa is, without doubt, one of the most advanced countries in Africa — if not the most advanced. The South African country has also become a popular hotbed for the digital currency market. In fact, it is considered by many to be the next frontier in Bitcoin.

According to the cryptocurrency exchange Paxful, South Africans recently traded more than $2.5 million worth of bitcoin in a single month.

Technological literacy is quite widespread in Africa. And since Bitcoin is based on blockchain technology, it has triggered a lot of interest on the continent, especially among the youthful population. Per Google Trends data, South Africa is ranked as fourth among all countries in the world for the frequency with which its citizens searched the keyword “Bitcoin” over the last year. Countries like Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, in addition to South Africa, have also demonstrated massive interest in bitcoin. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is reportedly planning a visit to Africa to explore crypto opportunities thanks to the widespread bitcoin adoption there.

The enthusiasm around ingenious technologies such as Bitcoin and blockchains has boosted adoption in South Africa. Many of the properties that make Bitcoin appealing in any place around the world can be listed as reasons why it is particularly popular in South Africa.

For instance, it is easy to access the peer-to-peer marketplace and cryptocurrency exchanges there. Using these platforms can be more simple and straightforward than opening and operating a bank account. Some of the popular bitcoin exchanges in South Africa include VALR and Luno.

Also, Bitcoin is decentralized and transverses all borders. This makes it an efficient payment method. And, besides enabling payment transactions, bitcoin is considered a wealth storage asset. In other words, investors classify the digital currency together with precious metals such as gold when it comes to storing value. This versatility feature endears bitcoin to many investors, including South Africans

The Volatility Of The Rand

But there are some conditions specific to South Africa that make Bitcoin appealing to those who live there.

The South African rand is, according to forex brokers operating in South Africa, considered one of the world's most-traded currencies in the world with high volatility tendencies. For instance, in March 2020, the rand’s volatility reached its highest mark since the 2008 financial crisis. The negative swing of the fiat currency sent shivers down the spines of investors. As a result, many investors moved to use bitcoin to shield their wealth against a sharp fall in prices.

Volatility weakens local currencies, leading to dollar scarcity and making bitcoin a preferred alternative for transactions. High demand for bitcoin due to weak fiat currency boosts its adoption. Here is another point: Government failure in South Africa has also boosted cryptocurrency adoption as investors use bitcoin to hedge against political risks.

Favorable Money Transfer Costs

Besides accessibility problems, processing transactions through banks in African countries is often a slow and costly experience. Additionally, you must provide personal information, including the date, your name, your date of birth and your home address. The complex bureaucracy makes the money transfer process very complicated.

Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, are quick and much cheaper. Deposits, withdrawals and other transactions often do not require as many personal details. Aside from being cheaper, bitcoin transactions are also more convenient methods of transferring value. This makes bitcoin an appealing alternative to fiat currency, growing its adoption significantly.

Impact of Government Regulations

Initially, there were no regulations governing bitcoin adoption in South Africa. However, the government has put anti-money laundering (AML) regulations into place.

The South African Reserve Bank is in the process of allowing the private sector to experiment with cryptocurrency use cases under regulatory supervision. However, the institution likely wants to be careful and conservative with approving bitcoin activity, like other regulatory bodies doubtlessly are. A significant goal is to prevent people from channeling money out of the country through encrypted and anonymous transactions.

That notwithstanding, the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still not adequately regulated in South Africa to protect newcomers, meaning there would be no recourse if you lost your money due to a bad actor.

Final Words

Bitcoin adoption has grown significantly around the world in the recent past. Some of the major causes of the growth include emerging cryptocurrency markets, major fiat currency fluctuation and the development of financial infrastructure. While the most-known African country for bitcoin adoption is Nigeria, South Africans are far from idle when it comes to their adoption of BTC.

Going forward, wider access to education and the internet will unlock the full potential of bitcoin in the country. Bitcoin will deliver on its promise as a new class of asset, giving investors more power through their portfolios without the need to rely on intermediaries.

New details have emerged suggesting that the Indian government will go ahead with banning cryptocurrency, in contrast to what the crypto community believes. In her latest interview regarding cryptocurrency legislation, India’s finance minister said that there will be a window for experimentation for cryptocurrency, blockchain, and fintech.

Reports of India Banning Cryptocurrency

The Indian crypto community is closely watching whether the government will ban cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. A cabinet note regarding cryptocurrency legislation is being finalized and will soon be submitted to the cabinet.

The latest information regarding the Indian crypto ban comes from Reuters which reported Sunday night that “India will propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets.” The publication cited an unnamed senior government official who claims to have direct knowledge of the plan. He said that bill “would criminalise possession, issuance, mining, trading and transferring crypto-assets.”

According to the official:

The bill would give holders of cryptocurrencies up to six months to liquidate, after which penalties will be levied.

Moreover, officials are confident that the bill will be enacted into law as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government holds a comfortable majority in parliament, the publication added.

Crypto Community Believes There Will Be No Ban

Many people on social media do not believe that India will go through with banning cryptocurrency, however, suggesting that the information provided by Reuters is outdated. They believe that the finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has indicated in her recent interviews that cryptocurrency will not be banned.

Over the weekend, the finance minister talked about bitcoin and cryptocurrency legislation in an interview on India Today. She was asked if India was heading into the zone where it is inevitable that the government will have to come around to the realization that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.

The minister of finance reiterated that a “cabinet note” on cryptocurrency is “getting prepared” and is “nearing completion.” She confirmed that it will soon be taken to the cabinet.

Noting that the supreme court has commented on cryptocurrency and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will make a call on the official digital rupee, the finance minister affirmed:

From our side, we are very clear that we are not shutting all options off. We will allow a certain amount of window for people to use so that experiments in blockchain, bitcoin, or whatever you may want to call it, the cryptocurrency experiments, and fintech which depends on such experiment will have that window available for them.

However, she emphasized that specific rules about cryptocurrencies will be in the cabinet note, which will be “ready soon.”

Earlier this month, Bitcoin.com News reported that the finance minister said: “There will be a very calibrated position taken … We are not closing our minds. We are certainly looking at the ways in which experimentations can happen in the digital world and cryptocurrency and so on.”

Her statements have given the Indian crypto community hope that India will regulate cryptocurrencies instead of imposing an outright ban.

However, according to Reuters’ most recent report, the senior official said that the plan is to ban private crypto assets while promoting blockchain technology and fintech. He was quoted as saying:

We don’t have a problem with technology. There’s no harm in harnessing the technology.

He clarified that the government’s moves would be “calibrated” in the extent of the penalties on those who did not liquidate crypto assets within the law’s grace period.

In the cryptocurrency bill published in 2019, the interministerial committee in charge of drafting the bill recommended “jail of up to 10 years on people who mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose of, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies,” the publication conveyed, adding that the official declined to discuss specifics in this area.

Meanwhile, Indian crypto traders are enjoying the crypto boom as the price of bitcoin hit all-time highs several times over recent months. Leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the country have reported record-high trading volumes and numbers of new users. “The money is multiplying rapidly every month and you don’t want to be sitting on the sidelines, a crypto trader named Sumnesh Salodkar was quoted by Reuters as saying. “Even though people are panicking due to the potential ban, greed is driving these choices.”

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman suggested that a complete ban on cryptocurrency may not be on the cards, as she promised that the government will not shut all options

There has been utter confusion over the future of cryptocurrency in India. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has maintained that a complete ban on cryptocurrency is not being considered, media reports citing government sources have suggested that the Reserve Bank of India has strongly recommended a ban on the blockchain-based currency in the country. Another report from news agency Thomson Reuters suggested that the government will go for a ban on cryptocurrency in India.

The government’s carefully veiled statements and a slew of contradictory media reports have made it impossible for anyone to predict what India’s bill on cryptocurrency will entail for the future of the sector.

On Sunday, FM Nirmala Sitharaman suggested that a complete ban on cryptocurrency may not be on the cards, as she promised that the government will not shut all options and a “window will be left open to allow experiments in the cryptocurrency space.”

This could mean that the government will illegalise the use of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, and instead regulate it as an asset class. Most Indian crypto stakeholders have never promoted the use of cryptocurrencies as legal tender but instead, talk about crypto as a new-age asset class that promises better returns than existing options such as gold and mutual funds.

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, hit a record high of $60,000 briefly on Saturday, nearly doubling in value this year. Globally, Bitcoin is also gaining acceptance as a form of payment with various institutional investors buying huge amounts of the cryptocurrency.

Talking to Inc42 about the FM’s statement, Sumit Gupta, cofounder and CEO of Mumbai-based crypto exchange CoinDCX said, “The very fact that the FM has mentioned a willingness to experiment, shows the government’s resolve in bringing a digital revolution. Collaborative efforts between stakeholders like us and the government is a must. Research and development will provide scope for a robust fintech ecosystem to be developed in India. The focus will be to build and explore new indigenous products and financial technologies while strengthening our monetary policies and accelerating technological development.”

Hours after the FM’s statement, a Reuters report, citing sources, claimed that India will propose banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets.

According to the report, the bill, titled “The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021,” would criminalise possession, issuance, mining, trading and transferring of crypto-assets.

In January, the bill was listed in the Lok Sabha bulletin for the ongoing budget session. The synopsis of the bill reads: “To create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.”

According to industry estimates, 7 Mn Indians hold over $1 Bn worth in cryptocurrencies. No official figures are available, yet.

Bitcoin & Ethereum Prices

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $55,243, an increase of 1.92% over the last seven days.

Ethereum was trading at $1,798, a fall of 2.43% from last week’s price.

India Will Have A Window For Crypto, Blockchain Experiments: FM Sitharaman

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reiterated the government’s stance on allowing a window for experiments in Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency, and suggested that a blanket ban may not be instituted on these new-age financial technologies.","Suggestions that the Indian government may introduce an outright ban on cryptocurrency could be the trigger behind Bitcoin’s volatile 48 hours and drop below $55,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was flying only three days ago, setting an all-time-high as it broke $60,000 with conviction.

The price looked like it was preparing to bed in while it gathered support in unchartered territory, but the signs of something being amiss were beginning to show up on the charts in the early hours of Monday morning as New Dehli was waking up.

Rumours of the Indian government’s apparent desire to outlaw cryptocurrency have been circulating for several years, but the fires of disregard to digital assets were being fully stoked this week as news of a draft bill detailing the ban began to emerge.

A tip-off from a senior government official leaked some of the details which suggested anyone found mining or owning cryptocurrency in India would face asset seizures, fines or even prison sentences.

It is understood the bill, if passed, would come with a six-month grace period to allow anyone holding cryptocurrencies time to dispose of their assets.

This potential amnesty, say analysts, is the driving force behind Bitcoin’s tumble from a high of $61,701 on Saturday, to a depth of $54,013 earlier this morning.

The situation in India paints a sudden and dark backdrop to what had been Bitcoin’s brightest spell in the flagship cryptocurrency’s 12-year-history.

Stimulus cheques

After solidifying support above $58,000, BTC looked to be building strongly and preparing to load up with US stimulus cheques in the coming weeks. Coupled with continual adoption from global institutions, the outlook of fresh investment was leaving the majority of commentators in bullish mood.

Few, however, had envisaged the spectre of the Indian government’s hostility towards crypto reappearing to throw a spanner in the works and triggering a flurry of sell orders.

Technical analysts are currently dissecting a mixed bag of information, with a fair split of opinions as to where the gravitational pull on Bitcoin currently sits.

Some suggest there is strong support at $51,000 and $49,500 which could lead to a bounce back up to the weekend’s highs, providing the investment predictions of Americans waving their stimulus cheques at crypto exchanges ring true.

Others claim the charts point to $54,000 being the line of defence that will hold Bitcoin steady.

Of the thousands of lines being drawn on countless charts today, there is no denying the market has taken on a bearish influence as the bulls steel into defensive mode.

Should those defences at $54,000 hold robustly enough to keep any bearish sentiment at bay, the bulls can strengthen and return to attack mode.

An anonymous whale just shifted 4,999 Bitcoin, worth nearly $275 million at the current price, to unknown wallets, according to Twitter-based crypto transaction tracker Whale-alert.io.

After hitting a fresh record peak at $61,780 on March 13, Bitcoin saw a period of bearish indecision that ended in a sharp sell-off. It was changing hands below $54,000 on Tuesday, which is down by more than 10 percent in the past 24 hours. The No.1 crypto asset then bounced back to $55,150, capping daily losses to around 6%.

Meanwhile, several metrics have hinted at a looming correction. Speculation mounted that the price drop came in tandem with wealthy investors depositing BTC to exchanges, presumably with the aim of taking profit before a more significant drop occurs.

The sentiment around Bitcoin among market participants remains mixed. While some expect a pullback to support levels below the $50,000 handle, others say BTC simply consolidates until the next rally occurs.

In addition, the distributed ledger monitoring has reported dozens of giant USDT transactions in the last hour.

One of the largest transactions involved a whale relocating 20,000,000 XRP worth $9.1 million from Nexo to a separate wallet of Binance origin. The Twitter handle Whale_Alert noted another transfer of 6009 ether, worth roughly $10.6 million, from Gemini crypto exchange to an anonymous wallet.

It is not the first time that multiple transactions of this magnitude have taken place, but such moves are rarely seen in the market. Bitcoin whales have been moving large stacks of their holdings at record levels over the last two months, amid high institutional demand for the crypto assets.

Although it is impossible to know why the cryptocurrency was moved, it could just be that a cryptocurrency exchange is shuffling its own holdings. Additional speculations include internal transfers between exchange wallets, institutions moving crypto to cold storage or OTC block trades.","A man in Germany described losing bitcoins worth half a million dollars in a scam.

He told the BBC that he fell for a Twitter account posing as Elon Musk offering to double his money.

It is an extreme version of so-called giveaway scams, which are popular with cryptocurrency.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

A man in Germany says he lost bitcoins worth $560,000 by falling for a scammer posing as Elon Musk, the BBC reported.

The man from Cologne — whom the BBC gave a pseudonym — described giving away his fortune in the mistaken belief that Musk would double his money.

The BBC said his loss was the largest single amount recorded by a Dutch group that tracks so-called giveaway scams.

Musk caused a stir on February 21 by tweeting, ""Dojo 4 Doge,"" a reference to the cryptocurrency dogecoin. He often tweets his enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies — moving markets in the process.

Scammers try to profit from this enthusiasm by filling the replies to Musk's genuine tweets with posts from accounts designed to mimic his.

The man who spoke with the BBC said he clicked on one.

The link led to a professional-looking page, the BBC reported, that described an offer in which people could send Musk bitcoins and receive twice as much in return.

The website offered to double quantities between 0.1 and 20 bitcoins — which at Tuesday's price would be worth $5,600 to $1.1 million.

But the page's authors had nothing to do with Musk.

The BBC did not specify which website ran the scam, but an example can be seen here on a now-deleted page on Medium — a blogging site that allows anyone to publish professional-looking pages:

A screenshot of a now-deleted page claiming to be giving away bitcoins from Elon Musk. Medium

The BBC said a ticking timer added a sense of urgency to the man's decision. He opted to send his full holding of 10 bitcoins for the offer, the BBC reported. Exchanged for dollars, they would be worth $560,000.

The man told the BBC he was thinking, ""This is definitely real.""

He said he realized his mistake when the timer counted down and no money came.

""I went upstairs and sat on the edge of the bed to tell my wife,"" he told the BBC. ""I woke her up and told her that I'd made a big mistake, a really big mistake.""

Cryptocurrency scams have soared in recent years, with little recourse for those who are duped. In 2019 alone, scammers took $4.6 billion from crypto traders, Insider's Sophia Ankel and Prabhjote Gill reported.

Fake cryptocurrency giveaways often target social-media accounts of high-profile figures, either hacking into their account and tweeting on their behalf or disguising another account to look official.

It's not the first time Musk — a well-known cryptocurrency enthusiast — has been used to give cover to a scam.

In July 2020, hackers managed to take over the Twitter accounts of people including Musk, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Apple, and Kim Kardashian, posting similar giveaway scams."

Bitcoin’s price flipped to green after Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday reaffirmed their expectations to keep interest rates close to zero at least through 2023, potentially bolstering the cryptocurrency’s appeal as a hedge against faster inflation.

As of press time, bitcoin was changing hands around $58,000, up from about $55,500 just before the Fed announced its decision around 18:00 coordinated universal time (2 p.m. ET).

The price has doubled this year, partly because of demand from institutional investors who are looking for an asset that might hold its worth if the dollar’s purchasing power declines. Central banks around the world have pumped trillions of dollars of freshly created money into global financial markets to stimulate their coronavirus-wrecked economies.

Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit on Wednesday published a research report arguing the “threshold is being reached” for cryptocurrency to become an investable asset class. On the same day, Morgan Stanley said it will offer its clients exposure to three bitcoin funds, while Hong Kong-listed software firm Meitu made additional investments in bitcoin and ether.

“This is a bullish step to further awareness and acceptance of bitcoin, and shows the organic underlying demand as investors look to seek alternatives to existing investment classes,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin.

Ether, bitcoin move tightly

Ether (ETH) was up on Wednesday, trading around $1,824.79 and climbing 2.24% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

“Ether and bitcoin are still moving tightly together,” OKCoin’s Lau said.

At the same time, the number of BTC locked in the Ethereum blockchain saw a sharp rise on Wednesday after dropping for more than a month, according to data from DeFi Pulse.

“The hypergrowth that markets exhibited earlier in the year, especially with ether, appears on the surface to have subsided, but the reality could not be any different,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at trading sentiment data provider Trade the Chain, said. “Specifically, the number of bitcoin locked on Ethereum continues to rise and much of this capital eventually lands across the DeFi ecosystem.”

A handful of lesser digital assets rose sharply Wednesday after Grayscale announced plans for new trusts linked to Chainlink’s LINK, Decentraland’s MANA and a handful of others. (Digital Currency Group is the parent of Grayscale and CoinDesk and an investor in Decentraland.)

Bitcoin’s temporary failure to move higher since Saturday’s all-time high may have also pushed some investors and traders to alternative cryptocurrencies.

“While this might be unexciting for bitcoin traders, it has ether traders licking their lips at the prospect of the leading altcoin regaining some market share,” Adam James, senior editor at OKEx Insights, said. “Likewise, traders will also be looking for altcoins and DeFi governance tokens to capitalize on a bitcoin consolidation.”

The note's authors, Lisa Shalett and Denny Galindo, stress that their determination is a cautious one, noting that any investment in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is a speculative one. Still, it represents another step in an ever-shifting viewpoint of the technology in the eyes of Wall Street from outright rejection to slow embrace.

As the two authors note in the piece's introduction:

""For speculative investment opportunities to rise to the level of an investable asset class that can play a role in diversified investment portfolios requires transformational progress on both the supply and demand sides. With cryptocurrency, we think that threshold is being reached. A firming regulatory framework, deepening liquidity, availability of products and growing investor interest—especially among institutional investors—have coalesced.""

Among the specific recommendations is the pursuit of more information for the would-be investor. The authors note at the end of the piece that ""our recommendation is that investors get educated and consider how and whether to get exposure to this bourgeoning asset class in their portfolio.""

As for what form that exposure might look like, the Morgan Stanley report outlines during its executive summary:

""As with any asset class still in its speculative phase, there are a multitude of risks—some predictable, some identified and some yet to be uncovered. Such risk characteristics limit prudent advice to having exposures in small positions in a highly diversified form, akin to how one might approach venture capital investing. Our initial modeling, replicated in spirit by a recently published CFA Institute study, suggests diversification benefits from the low correlation of cryptocurrency to other assets and that Sharpe ratio improvements can be achieved with positions no greater than 2.5%. It is important to keep in mind that we are only in the top of the first inning.""

Then, in the note's conclusion, the authors reiterate that they aren't at the point of recommending outright direct exposure in the form of owning any particular coin.

""From our vantage point, coin trading remains in its infancy. Issues around finding true price discovery and best execution are still to be addressed. We have yet to be convinced there and, therefore, advise clients to proceed with caution,"" they write, concluding:

""For those qualified* investors ready to gain exposure, we suggest starting with publicly traded products—preferably ones that are multiasset and potentially accessing the growth opportunities through a venture capital/private equity investment in the blockchain ecosystem.""

The note's release comes more than a month after Bloomberg News reported that Counterpoint Global, a unit of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, is weighing whether to invest in bitcoin.","Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank's internal communications. Bitcoin's rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with ""an aggressive risk tolerance"" who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.","Is cryptocurrency a viable option for ecommerce stores? Ecommerce stores can accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin for purchases through Paypal and Coinbase, but should they?

Cryptocurrency is everywhere, including ecommerce. Between Coinbase’s public listing, the sale of a $69 million NFT via Christie’s auction house, a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin by Elon Musk’s Tesla, and soaring valuations that make one wonder when the bubble will burst, you can’t walk to your mailbox without tripping over a social media mention about cryptocurrency. With all the hype, there’s gotta be a good reason to transfer some of your money to crypto, right?

Maybe.

But even cryptocurrency is a long way from being as accepted as a Visa card or even PayPal online. Part of that is a lack of education and technological integrations, but there are some serious barriers.

This article will break down the promise and problems of cryptocurrency for the ecommerce space.

The promise of crypto for ecommerce

Let’s get the promises of cryptocurrency out of the way. In addition to being the cool new(ish) tech thing that is so complicated and esoteric that only the cool nerds are doing it—which is reason enough for some folks to invest—the technology has some promise.

Crypto promise 1: Lower cost online transactions

There’s a promise of lower transaction fees for ecommerce sites. Credit card companies and payments apps like Stripe or Square will charge anywhere from 3-5% on each transaction. Many ecommerce companies build these fees into their online store prices. Cryptocurrency transactions are often feeless or as little as 1% .

Crypto promise 2: Another option for the bank-averse

There are plenty of reasons why some people don’t trust banks to hold their money. Systemic racism, lack of access, and plain lack of trust in the banking system are all reasons that people don’t use the banking system. Add on the (rightfully earned) distrust in the credit card companies, and many people find themselves working only in cash.

Many of these people will trust a network or individual (like Logan Paul) to invest their money in because they believe they can trust a YouTuber more than they can trust the faceless banking monolith. Which, fair.

Crypto promise 3: Secure transactions can reduce fraud

Perhaps most exciting for ecommerce stores is the promise that cryptocurrency can reduce fraud. Chargebacks and fraudulent returns can hurt an ecommerce company’s bottom line, and many stores plan for some fraudulent charges. The blockchain technology that underlies cryptocurrency should make fraudulent charges disappear.

The problems with a crypto ecommerce

These three main promises of adding cryptocurrency to the ecommerce tech stack look pretty good. Until you start to look at all the problems that need addressing before it becomes a viable option. We’ll try to get through these quickly.

The rise of Bitcoin’s (BTC) value over time via Coindesk

High price: as of publication, 1 Bitcoin = $56,433.70 USD. No, you do not have to buy an entire Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency), but the misconception may turn some folks off, initially. Not much consumer buy-in: this is still a niche currency. It’s gaining ground steadily, but as of 2019 only about 36.5 million Americans own cryptocurrency. Instability and volatility: while you don’t have to invest heavily to buy into any cryptocurrency, it still feels a little like gambling. Bitcoin’s price has increased dramatically over the last several years (see the image above), but as a traded commodity, its value is based on the perceived value. That makes it more uncertain than any fiat currency backed by governments. This also makes it dangerous for ecommerce companies who have to trade in fiat currency to hold all (or any, really) of their assets in crypto. Transactions can take a long time to verify: this may slow down the instantaneous feel of current ecommerce sites. This, of course, varies based on the crypto wallet, the site, and the currency you’ve invested in. High barriers to entry: for less tech-savvy individuals, understanding how crypto works can be confusing at best. At the very least, someone who uses the currency would need to be able to transfer fiat funds electronically to their wallet, which is probably going to require a bank account for ease of access. That’s a problem that will undercut the promise 2 for the bank-averse. This also assumes that to use the currency you don’t have to understand how it is mined, traded, and verified. Transaction verification for cryptocurrency comes at a cost to providers, and may not keep up with the high volume of transactions on ecommerce stores: this is a significant problem for ecommerce software and wallet providers, who will need to build in the systems (including energy consumption, which we’ll get to later) to back up wallets, transfer funds at preset thresholds, and generally do a lot of funds or data management to support higher transaction volumes. Governments don’t love the idea of alternative currency: India is the latest to try to ban digital assets (including trading, holding, and mining) in preparation to build its own cryptocurrency. The reasoning is sound: the more that people invest in an alternative currency, the less money they hold in government-backed funds, which could impact the value of the government’s investment. This issue is still developing, however, and other options like Stablecoin may provide a government-backed alternative to alternative currency.

So is cryptocurrency good for ecommerce?

Again, maybe.

For those who invest in cryptocurrency, trading Bitcoin for services should be fine. If you want to withdraw your money from Coinbase or another alt wallet, you may have to pay higher fees than you would to withdraw from a stock brokerage account. That doesn’t hurt the consumers much, but it could cause problems for ecommerce companies who need to pay their electric bills or purchase supplies.

At the same time, this is a great time for Coinbase to invest in apps for ecommerce stores. Paypal just moved to the #1 cloud company in market cap in a recent report by Bessemer Venture Partners and Shopify shifted to #4 because of the increase in online shopping caused by the pandemic. The best day to plant an ecommerce app was yesterday, but the second-best day to plant an ecommerce app is today. And the competition is strong: Paypal also released a cryptocurrency option for its online payments, so if you’re following the trends, this may be a harbinger of good things to come.

A serious strike against cryptocurrency’s growing popularity is its tendency to gobble up energy. Bitcoin mining—the process by which transactions are verified by solving complex mathematical problems—consumes more electricity every year than the country of Argentina and has a carbon footprint as large as the country of New Zealand. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is concerned about the efficiency of the technology, and with good reason. If it takes the electricity usage of a major South American country to verify transactions, we may have a problem down the line.","Skip Dogecoin, Buy Bitcoin if You Want a Stable Cryptocurrency","In brief On March 7, Chinese phone and app maker, Meitu, announced it had bought $40 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Today it has announced it has bought even more of the two top cryptocurrencies.

The company now holds around $90 million in digital assets.

Chinese tech company Meitu today announced that it has bought even more Ethereum and Bitcoin—bringing its total crypto holdings up to around $90 million.

Meitu, which makes smartphones and selfie apps, snapped up $22 million in Ethereum and $17.9 million in Bitcoin earlier this month. Today it bought an additional $28.4 million Ethereum and $21.6 million Bitcoin.

“As at the date of this announcement, the Group has accumulated a net purchase of approximately US$90 million worth of cryptocurrencies,” the company said in a statement.

Meitu is the latest tech company to make a big cryptocurrency purchase as the value of the biggest digital assets continues to rocket. Bitcoin has exploded in price since COVID-19 rocked economies around the world: today it is trading for $57,653—an increase of over 1,000% in one year. Not a bad rebound following the coin’s devastating March 2020 crash.

Its bounce back is largely thanks to big firms snapping up the currency. Cloud software firm MicroStrategy was the first, preaching what its CEO, Michael Saylor, sees as the wonders of “digital gold” amid a still recovering economy and inflationary monetary policies on the part of the US Federal Reserve. The company now holds more than $5 billion in Bitcoin.

The company was soon followed by payments company Square, which put $50 million in the currency in October. Earlier this year, Square then put another $170 million into Bitcoin.

Car company Tesla is the latest giant to invest in the currency. In February, the company completed a $1.5 billion Bitcoin buy, which precipitated the surge in price that Bitcoin enjoys today.

And Fujian-based Meitu is following suit. The company bought the additional 16,000 Ethereum and 386 Bitcoin because it believes the cryptocurrencies “have ample room for appreciation in value.”

The company added that allocating part of its treasury in Bitcoin and Ethereum is useful as an alternative to cash, which is “subject to depreciation,” according to the company, echoing comments from MicroStrategy’s Saylor, who has argued the same.

Meitu also said that blockchain technology, while still young, “has the potential to disrupt both existing financial and technology industries.”

But the company did add that it realizes Bitcoin and Ethereum are prone to price swings.

“Notwithstanding the long-term prospects, cryptocurrency prices in general are still highly volatile and therefore the Board currently decided to invest in the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Ether and Bitcoin, which the Board believes should enhance shareholder value in the long-term,” the statement read.

It warned that there is “no assurance as to the timing, quantity, type or price of any cryptocurrencies to be purchased or sold” under the company’s crypto investment plan.”

Meitu, founded in 2008, launched Hong Kong’s biggest initial public offering in years in 2016 when it listed on the stock exchange.

The company says its mission is to “to let everyone become beautiful easily” with its image processing apps.","Why did this happen?

Well, there’s a common misconception among new crypto market participants that bitcoin is a company stock. While its price activity can correlate with traditional markets on occasion, it is, in fact, an entirely separate asset class.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset secured by cryptography that can be used to make electronic payments over the internet or act as a store of value like gold or silver.

Think of cryptocurrencies as the emails of the currency world. They do not exist in physical form, they can be sent in minutes and they do not require multiple intermediaries to handle the payment.

Unlike fiat currencies like the U.S dollar or euro that store all card and wire transactions on a central ledger maintained by a single authority, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use a technology called “blockchain.” This is a globally distributed ledger that can be maintained and copied by anyone on the planet and ensures total immutability and transparency.

Key differences between bitcoin and stocks

Stocks

Traded on traditional stock exchanges such as Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse, etc.

Can only be traded Monday to Friday. Market opening and closing times vary between stock exchanges

Regulated financial products

Purchasers receive share certificates to show legal proof of ownership

Companies can produce new shares after publicly launching, though there is a finite limit

Brokerages maintain their own record of stock trades that they execute on behalf of clients. In the United States, this information is not publicly available unless an investor purchases over 5% of a listed company

Bitcoin

Traded on centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges

Crypto markets do not close so bitcoin can be traded at any time on any day

Bitcoin is not a regulated investment vehicle; however, most international jurisdictions recognize it as property

Purchasers can hold their own bitcoin or delegate safe storage to third-party custodians

There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. No new coins can be created

The Bitcoin blockchain publicly records all transactions and can be viewed or downloaded by anyone at any time

Company stocks that are tied to bitcoin

Despite the differences between these two investment options, there are a number of publicly traded companies whose stocks are tied to the performance of bitcoin. This is because the companies are either directly engaged in bitcoin-related activities such as mining, hold a substantial amount of bitcoin in reserves or their target market is crypto users.

These companies include:

Silvergate Capital

MicroStrategy

Square

Riot Blockchain

Nvidia

Argo Blockchain

MGT Capital Investments

BitFarms

Diginex

Hut 8 Mining

Voyager Digital

Canaan Creative

This generally means that when bitcoin’s price is performing well these stocks also tend to perform well, and vice versa. Recently, JPMorgan launched a new financial product called the “Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket” – a debt instrument linked to leading crypto focused companies that allows investors to gain indirect exposure to bitcoin and the altcoin market.

Correlation is the measure of the relationship between two or more items. In this case, it’s used to measure the relationship between the price movements of two markets. There are several methods to calculate correlation, though the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC) is the preferred method for measuring similarities between different financial assets. The PPMCC is measured between 1.0 and -1.0. The closer the value is to -1.0, the less correlated the two assets are; the closer the value is to 1.0, the more correlated are the two assets.

For anyone interested to know how PPMCC is calculated, here’s the equation: ρxy ​= Cov(x,y) / σx​σy​

Where ρxy = Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient

Cov(x,y) = covariance of variables x and y

σx = standard deviation of x

σy = standard deviation of y

​The chart below illustrates a clear rise in correlation between bitcoin and a range of traditional financial markets, including the S&P 500, gold, oil and U.S. bonds.

The highest correlation between bitcoin and the stock market is the S&P 500 – an index of the largest 500 companies in the United States – with a value of 0.22. This is most likely due to a rise in institutional investment entering the crypto market and large players adding bitcoin to diversify their portfolios. When either market rises or falls it presumably creates a knock-on effect that spreads to other markets.

However, Bitcoin looks quite risky at current levels due to a couple of factors. With Covid-19 cases on the decline, the economic outlook is improving and bond yields are also on the rise. Considering this, investors are likely to start moving funds back to real-economy sectors, and non-productive assets such as Bitcoin, which rallied big through the pandemic, could be impacted. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks could be a safer way to play the long-term upside from cryptocurrencies, without taking a position in individual currencies. The theme, which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain, is up by about 124% since 12/31/2019, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 22%. Year-to-date, the theme is up by 4%, compared to the S&P 500 which is up around 5%. Within our theme, digital payments player Square (SQ) has been the strongest performer, rising by 287% since the end of 2019, while exchange major CME Group (CME) has been the worst performer in our theme, rising by just about 4% over the same period.

Bitcoin prices have surged by more than 50% over the last month and remain up by about 4x over the 12 months, due to higher retail and institutional interest. That being said, Bitcoin remains a risky investment, given its relative lack of utility and extremely high volatility. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks – which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have some exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain – could be a safer way to play the crypto space, without betting on individual currencies. The theme has done well, rallying by over 100% over the last year. Below is a bit more about the key companies in the theme and how they have been faring.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock saw big gains over 2020, driven by growing demand for its GPUs from gaming consoles and data centers and its planned acquisition of CPU designer ARM. The company recently indicated that it could restart the production of dedicated crypto mining GPUs, which essentially remove the video outputs that are required for gaming.

Square (SQ) a payments company, allows users to buy and sell bitcoin via its Cash mobile payment application. The company said that bitcoin-related Revenue surged by about 8x over the first nine months of 2020 to around $2.8 billion.

PayPal (PYPL) a large online payments processor has also reported increasing engagement on its PayPay mobile app after it introduced support for bitcoin last October, with about half its crypto users opening the PayPal app daily.

CME Group (CME) the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange, also offers bitcoin futures contracts. The exchange has emerged as the world’s largest futures exchange for Bitcoin, with open interest – contracts traded but not squared off – for the cryptocurrency standing at $2.1 billion.

[Updated 12/7/2020] How Nvidia, Square & PayPal Stocks Are Benefiting From Soaring Bitcoin Prices



Bitcoin prices have surged by over 160% year-to-date, driven by multiple factors including higher institutional interest, fintech companies Paypal and Square’s moves into the crypto space, and also by a view that scarce digital currency could be a hedge against inflation and a weakening U.S. dollar. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks – which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have some exposure to the cryptocurrency space – is up a solid 110% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by just about 14% over the same period. Key stocks in our theme include Square (SQ), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and CME Group (CME).

Although crypto likely represents a small portion of these company’s revenues at the moment, it does have the potential to be big. For example, Payment apps Square and PayPal, who make money by buying bitcoin from brokers and selling them to their customers by adding a “spread” stand to benefit as prices and volumes rise. Square’s Cash App generated about $1.63 billion in Bitcoin-related sales in Q3 2020, an 11x jump year-over-year. Similarly, Nvidia (NVDA) also benefits from demand for its top-of-the-line GPUs such as the Ampere lineup from cryptocurrency miners.

[Updated 10/29/2020] Cryptocurrency Stocks To Watch

Interest in cryptocurrency is surging once again with Bitcoin prices up by almost 30% over the last month, driven by growing institutional interest and Paypal’s recent move to allow its customers to buy and sell certain cryptocurrencies. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks – which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have some exposure to the cryptocurrency space – is up 88% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by just about 5% over the same period. This theme could be of interest to investors who are looking for upside from cryptocurrency adoption and prices, but want to avoid buying into the currencies themselves considering the volatility, risk of fraud, or cyber theft, or potential portfolio mandates. Below is a bit more about the stocks in our theme and how they have fared this year.

Square (SQ) cash mobile wallet app has emerged as a very popular way for people to buy and sell Bitcoin. The stock has gained a whopping 183% year-to-date, as investors bet that Square’s digital payment solutions will continue to gain traction through and post Covid-19. The stock has dropped by about -9% over the last 5 trading days, however.

Nvidia (NVDA) a semiconductor company that is best known for its graphic processing units (GPU) which are increasingly used in machine learning and AI, is also finding application in bitcoin mining. The stock has gained over 131% year to date although it declined by about -3% over the last week.

PayPal (PYPL) a large online payments processor, has indicated that it would allow customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum directly within its PayPal and Venmo app. The stock is up by 88% this year and was down by about -1% over the last 5 trading days.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a semiconductor major that makes CPUs and GPUs, which are increasingly used in bitcoin mining. The stock has gained about 79% year-to-date and remained largely flat over the last 5 trading days.

CME Group (CME) the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange, also offers bitcoin futures contracts. The stock is down by about -18% year-to-date and declined by about -2% over the last week.

While crypto stocks look attractive, 2020 has also created many pricing discontinuities that can offer attractive trading opportunities. For example, you’ll be surprised how the stock valuation for Adobe vs. Corcept Therapeutics shows a disconnect with their relative operational growth. You can find many such discontinuous pairs here.

No.10: Chainlink ($LINK)

Chainlink (LINK) is an Ethereum token that powers the Chainlink decentralized oracle network (DON), a leading on-chain provider that allows smart contracts on Ethereum to connect securely to external data sources, APIs and payment systems. At the start of 2021, Chainlink had an impressive bull rally, surging from an $11 low to an all-time high of $36.9. And that’s not all.

According to their recent report “BITCOIN At the Tipping Point,” Citibank’s Citi GPS platform had high praise for Chainlink and its token, writing: Originally designed for the Ethereum platform, it is starting to be adopted by others such as Tezos and Polkadot. Chainlink was recognized by the World Economic Forum which named the startup in its 100 most promising Technology Pioneers of 2020.

Developers that utilize the Chainlink network pay with the protocol’s native token, LINK. Thus, a token that helps to facilitate the growth of the on-chain ecosystem may also gain prominence over Bitcoin in time as it becomes increasingly critical to the operation of the blockchain infrastructure.

It is thus already possible to envision a commerce-linked or infrastructure-linked coin that may eventually eclipse Bitcoin. More such possibilities may emerge. Innovation in the chain-based ecosystem is continuing apace and today’s offerings may yet give way to a new invention that garners more attention and assets than Bitcoin.”

We’d say that’s reason enough to keep an eye on Chainlink.

No.9: Uniswap ($UNI)

Uniswap is a leading decentralized crypto exchange that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It employs a fairly new type of trading model called an automated liquidity protocol, which incentivizes people trading on the exchange to become liquidity providers. Coindesk has a helpful introduction to the exchange, describing it in the following way:

“Each token listed has its pool that users can contribute to, and the prices for each token are worked out using a math algorithm run by a computer (explained in “How token price is determined,” below). With this system, a buyer or seller does not have to wait for an opposite party to appear to complete a trade. Instead, they can execute any trade instantly at a known price provided there’s enough liquidity in the particular pool to facilitate it.”

Introduced in September 2020, Uniswap’s UNI is a governance token that was distributed according to a set release schedule. 4000 UNI tokens were airdrop and offered to users who had previously used Uniswap’s services. For those interested in trading them, exchanges, such as Bityard and, of course, Uniswap itself.

As of this writing, those free tokens are now worth an eye-watering $12,000, making UNI definitely one to watch in 2021.

No.8: Cardano ($ADA)

Launched in 2017 as a competitor to the Ethereum blockchain, the Cardano blockchain platform was designed by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), a decentralized company headed by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum. IOHK started in 2015 and builds blockchains and cryptocurrencies for businesses, educational institutions and governments.

First offered for sale in September 2015, ADA coins have experienced the same ups and downs of other cryptocurrencies, all the while achieving an all-time high in February 2021 of $1.49. As of March 2021, their market cap is in the region of $39bn, and there are approximately 31.2 billion ADA coins in circulation, with supply capped at 45 billion.

There’s been some buzz about the introduction of smart contract functionality on Cardano, which will offer developers the options to create and deploy their decentralized applications (DApps). Cardano is also the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research, and their stated goal is” to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins – to individuals – and be an enabling force for positive change and progress.”

Forecasting for ADA remains bullish, with many analysts expecting it to hit $2 by the end of the year. Some are even talking about a peak of $10 by year’s end. Keep eye on ADA in Bityard.

No. 7: Tron ($TRX)

No, not that Tron (the 1982 film is fire, by the way). $TRON is a cryptocurrency that was founded by the TRON foundation and is currently one of the most hyped projects making headlines today. CEO Justin Sun was added to “Forbes 30 Under 30 in 2017.”

TRON aims to construct a costless, worldwide digital entertainment network that allows users to distribute and share content effortlessly and inexpensively. By removing the need for a mediator, TRON empowers anyone to put their content on its blockchain-built ecosystem, driving down the prices of distribution channels for publishers, while hinting at the possibility of lower consumer fees when accessing that content. And $TRX is the token that powers the entire system.

According to their website, they have many heavy-weight core partners, including Poloniex, Samsung, BitTorrent, Swisscom Blockchain and Opera. Remarkably, TRON hosts more dApps than Ethereum, which has led many investors to speculate that TRON is going to be a lucrative investment choice in 2021. It remains to be seen if they can follow through on their stated mission to “decentralize the web” and transform stable and even sideways movement into upward movement in the year ahead.

No.6: Ripple ($XRP)

First released in 2012, Ripple is both a cryptocurrency and a digital payment network for financial transactions. As we wrote in our article “XRP price prediction for 2021-2025,” Ripple’s XRP coin remains one of the most undervalued crypto assets in the world.

XRP is a payment token that was created by Ripple Labs to be used on its decentralized payments system. While the company started with a blockchain-based system, XRP is used with a network of validation nodes rather than a blockchain. The Ripple network can be used for more than just sending XRP, and, although the token is limited in supply, it isn’t mined in the same way as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which many see as one of its advantages in terms of speed and cost.

Along with every other token on the market, $XRP lost considerable value during the crash at the beginning of 2020, but has risen in value and remains relevant as the fuel for Ripple, the open-source platform developed to facilitate quick and cheap transactions. Several financial giants have even thrown their weight behind Ripple, including JP Morgan, HSBC and MoneyGram, among others. It remains to be seen, however, if the recent rift with MoneyGram over the SEC suit will prove detrimental to the asset’s value.

Many cryptocurrency traders feel that a global transition away from the traditional financial system to one using blockchain is imminent. Because Ripple offers to facilitate this transition on an institutional level, the token could be one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2021. It is certainly one of the tokens on this list with the most potential. It has solid technology and a rapidly expanding network, which opens new doors in international banking and payment networks.

No.5: Litecoin ($LTC)

Think of Litecoin as the Rodney Dangerfield of crypto – it can’t get enough respect. Created in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, an ex-Google employee, it is formed from Bitcoin, with similar features and characteristics, but, crucially, is lighter and faster.

Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. From a technical standpoint, Litecoin is nearly identical to bitcoin, making it an early spinoff or altcoin of the popular cryptocurrency. And, just like its older brother Bitcoin, the supply of Litecoin is capped at 84 million, with approximately 75% (or roughly 65 million) of it having been mined already.

Many argue that Litecoin is one of the most undervalued cryptocurrencies in the world, despite being around for a decade. Whereas Bitcoin is often referred to as the gold of the crypto world, Litecoin is seen as silver. Recently, Litecoin surged by more than 630% from its lowest level in 2020, which has brought its total market cap to more than $12 billion, making it the 9th largest cryptocurrency in the world, with forecasters predicting that its value could move beyond $200.

However, it recently shed almost half of its gains without any rebound. But Litecoin enjoys widespread investor confidence and typically enjoys a solid value correlation with Bitcoin. Despite the perception of it as “the lite version of bitcoin,” it has a lot to recommend itself.

No.4: Zcash ($ZEC)

Zcash is seen by some as a zee privacy alternative to Bitcoin (couldn’t resist—all of us at Trality are based in German-speaking Vienna). In all seriousness, according to Zcash, it “offers confidentiality to protect your privacy and your financial history, and transactions can be confirmed quickly with low transaction fees,” seeing itself as “a fair and open currency that can be spent, sent and received via mobile phone, computer or digital wallet,” while offering “everyone equal access, regardless of social status or demographic.” All of this is made possible through zero-knowledge cryptography dubbed zk-SNARKs and is developed by the Electric Coin Company (ECC).

First mined in 2016, Zcash has capped its number at 21 million units (its circulating supply is about half this number) just like Bitcoin. At the end of 2020, they underwent their first halving as well as did away with their unpopular “Founders Reward,” but exchanges such as Bittrex have been moving to delist privacy coins such as Zcash, Monero (XMR) and Dash (DASH) to ensure compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.

Only time will tell if these sorts of concerns will impact privacy coins, but analysts have been talking about Zcash hitting $350 by the end of this year. If its price history is any indication, traders could be in for a bumpy ride, as Zcash can be volatile. But, then again, so are most cryptocurrencies.

No.3: Bitcoin Cash ($BCH)

Variously described as “a software upgrade,” “like a new version of Microsoft Word,” “Bcash,” and even “Btrash,” Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that is a fork of Bitcoin and was created in 2017. The intention behind the inception of Bitcoin Cash was to accommodate a larger block size when compared to Bitcoin, allowing more transactions into a single block. Despite the differences between the two, though, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin have some technical similarities, use the same consensus mechanism and have their supply capped at 21 million.

If you’ve got 37 minutes to spare, then check out the video “Bitcoin Cash: The Road To Mass Adoption” in which leading figures from the BCH ecosystem explain the reasons behind their optimism for 2021. Contributors such as Roger Ver, Josh Green, Shomari Prince, George Donnelly and Jonathan Toomin explain why they see Bitcoin Cash as the blockchain world’s answer to the most significant challenges facing the global financial system. Whether or not 2021 turns out to be a breakout year for BCH remains anyone’s guess. But a recent announcement by Japanese e-commerce Rakuten bodes well. The Japanese company has annual revenues of more than $13 billion and is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the country. Thousands of consumers across Japan will now be able to make purchases with cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin Cash.

No.2: Ethereum ($ETH)

While bitcoin might be the most popular cryptocurrency amongst investors, it’s not the most influential. That award goes to Ethereum and for good reason, as it allows anyone to build upon its blockchain. If Bitcoin harnessed blockchain for money and payments, Ethereum ‘s blockchain has a wider variety of applications, from its native token Ether (ETH) to smart contracts, among other things.

Founded in 2014, Ethereum is at the forefront of the DeFi (decentralized finance) revolution, which makes it possible to shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance via decentralized technologies built on the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and volume, hit a record high recently, buoyed by growing institutional interest. By the end of September 2020, Ethereum’s market cap skyrocketed by 60% from $25 billion to $40 billion. At one point, one token was worth $483 before sliding down to $358. In the weeks after, Ethereum shocked investors when it reached $410 and continued to rally alongside bitcoin back in November. If this positive trend continues throughout 2021, then we will see a bullish $ETH.

With such great value for money, Ethereum is a smart investment option for those just getting started in the cryptocurrency market. The strength of the $ETH token correlates with the scale of the network, which means the token will only move from strength to strength as more dApps and projects are launched on the network.

In the coming months, the rise in popularity of DeFi products alongside a successful deployment of the Ethereum 2.0 network upgrade bodes exceptionally well for Ethereum’s price.

No.1: Bitcoin (BTC)

Love it or hate it, but you can’t deny its enviable staying power, market dominance and continued importance to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These are just a few of the reasons why flagship bitcoin is referred to as “the King of Crypto.”

Developed in 2011 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s reputation precedes itself. No self-respecting cryptocurrency ranking would be complete without mentioning it, especially since it holds about 65% of the market cap.

With its popularity, though, comes a lot of hype. In March 2021, bitcoin prices were achieving record highs, with a single bitcoin valued over $60,000. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and recent crypto convert, is even predicting that bitcoin will hit $100,000 by the end of the year. Whether its value continues to charge ahead or levels off (or even dips), there can be no doubt that bitcoin will likely continue to command the cryptocurrency market. As it does, traders will consistently benefit from high liquidity regardless of the health of the market. And while bitcoin is volatile, it demonstrates consistent growth。

Ready to invest in cryptocurrencies?

So now that you’ve got some valuable insight into which cryptocurrencies are worth considering this year, you might have a few practical questions related to testing the cryptocurrency waters. Following are four main steps to help when you are ready:",,,
2021-03-19,"Bitcoin believers may have new reason to rejoice following the stimulus checks, but Ethereum has use cases on its side.

U.S. President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID Relief Bill has passed congress and stimulus checks are soon to be distributed. Early signs indicate recipients are ready to buy Bitcoin.

A survey by Mizuho Securities showed that out of 235 participants who expect to receive stimulus checks from the COVID Relief Bill, 10% are interested in investing in Bitcoin. It's a small sample size, but according to the survey investing in Bitcoin was a more popular response than investing in traditional stocks.

If that kind of runaway popularity doesn't move you in itself, consider that it could translate into $40 billion dollars running like a river directly from Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package into Bitcoin.

In the same week, Bank of America strategists suggested to Bloomberg that the price of BTC can be moved 1% for just $93 million.

Bank of America strategists said in a note to Bloomberg on Wednesday: ""Bitcoin is extremely sensitive to increased dollar demand. We estimate a net inflow into Bitcoin of just $93 million would result in price appreciation of 1%, while the similar figure for gold would be closer to $2 billion or 20 times higher. In contrast, the same analysis for the 20-year-plus Treasuries shows that multibillion money flows do not have a significant impact on price, pointing to the much larger and stable nature of the U.S. Treasuries markets,""

If you take the survey and projections on face value, you could surmise Bitcoin prices will be moved by over 430% by the influx of $40,000,000 flowing in from invested U.S. COVID Relief money.

It seems reasonable to expect the 12 month Bitcoin bull run to continue, making it the crypto success story of 2021, right?

DeFi Could Steal Bitcoin's Thunder

Before the Bitcoin bull run, DeFi was a strong competitor as the most dominant story in crypto. BTC's new price heights have made the world's most famous cryptocurrency again the center of attention. Bitcoin may always be the star of the cryptoworld and certainly has seen wide popularity and acceptance as a store of value, but Ethereum's fortunes have generally kept pace with and possibly exceeded Bitcoin since the end of last year.

Since December 2020, Bitcoin has risen from over $28,000 to more than $58,000 (up roughly 207%). Ethereum has traveled from more than $746 to over $1800 (up roughly %240).

This week, Bank of America published a report titled ""Bitcoin's Dirty Little Secrets"". Excerpts from the report are unflattering to the world's most famous cryptocurrency.

Some of the statements coming from the report include:

""The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer appreciation…""

""There is no good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up…""

And they point out Bitcoin's environmental impact is not desirable, stating: ""we calculate that a $1bn dollar inflow into Bitcoin is equal to 1.2mn cars driven over the course of a year or 12.7mn barrels of oil.""

They go on to extol the virtues of Ethereum, stating in the report: ""Bitcoin is the most talked about cryptocurrency but Ethereum [the blockchain] has more features, including being more flexible in its hosting of decentralized finance (DeFi) than the Bitcoin blockchain.""

""DeFi does, however, show the opportunity which (distributed ledger technology) offers to finance. We believe that one of the best differences against being disintermediated by DeFi would be mainstream finance grasping these opportunities.""

The Hopes and Fears of DeFi…

As a digital currency, Bitcoin is simply designed with a more limited range of use cases compared to Ethereum which has smart contract capabilities. Arguably, Ethereum is the needed sequel to Bitcoin's success. But how will their performances compare in 2021?

""Bitcoin is the asset of choice for investors looking for a store of value investment characteristics in the cryptocurrency market. Success then is an ongoing price appreciation for this asset. And appreciate it will as long as investors continue to believe in the future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, on the other hand, is not only a cryptocurrency. It is a network that supports smart contracts, Dapps (decentralized applications), and Defi (decentralized finance) projects. Investors that are looking to invest in up-and-coming tech should pay extra attention to this crypto asset. Over 41 Billion dollars is currently locked in DeFi projects on Ethereum blockchain compared with 4 Billion only 8 months ago. That's what success continues to look like for Ethereum this year as well — ongoing expansion and innovation,"" Tally Greenberg, Head of Business Development at Allnodes said.

Phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0 — known as ""Serenity"" — launched on December 1, 2020. The hope for this upgrade to the Ethereum network is meant to address the needs for speed, efficiency, and scalability.

""BTC is unlikely to be dethroned as the leading cryptocurrency, but the growth shown on the Ethereum blockchain is hard to bet against. They will naturally be compared 'against' one another although this makes little sense from a functional point of view since each is vying for separate and mutually beneficial use-cases. BTC's 'digital gold' narrative is straightforward which is beneficial for attracting new users who may be intimidated by the apparently more complex and dynamically evolving ETH narrative,"" Jason Peckham, Analyst at Invictus Capital said.

It remains to be seen whether Ethereum 2.0 will handle the need for speed to support the DeFi range of use cases.

""To me, Ethereum looks very attractive for long-term purchases, since it has a much greater technical potential for application than Bitcoin. The Ethereum blockchain programmability offers incredible growth opportunities. Bitcoin with its limited emission is rather a tool for saving and paying. Ethereum, in turn, is a tool for real usage of blockchain technology in third-party projects,"" Dyanis Zabauski, CEO of Coinmatics said.

But nevermind the actual real-world uses — can Ethereum compete with Bitcoin's price performance?

""I think it's highly likely that ETH will beat BTC in terms of price performance in 2021… Ethereum has not fully realized the benefit from the growing popularity of DeFi services and NFTs. The exploding NFT market will directly benefit the value of ETH and I think that ETH has room to grow until its price encompasses the current excitement around NFTs,"" Noam Levenson cryptocurrency writer and founder of Narrow Straight Writing.

Some experts point to lagging performance as a reason to keep an eye on Ethereum, as we may see much more movement in 2021.

""From a relative performance standpoint, ETH the second-biggest cryptocurrency is lagging Bitcoin up only 20% from it's All-Time Highs vs Bitcoin 175%. In previous cycles, we have seen ETH catch up to BTC growth when BTC begins to correct because the profits taken from BTC are cycled into altcoins. Because ETH is one to two cycles back from BTC in its growth cycle it makes sense that return on the laggard would outperform the larger market cap of BTC from here,"" Jake Wujastyk Chief Market Analyst at TrendSpider said.

Until Ethereum 2.0 is a known quantity, there will be doubts about its ability to meet the already tremendous need for bandwidth to support transactions.

""Ethereum might beat Bitcoin in terms of percentage gain this year. So far in 2021, ETH has increased by value by nearly 150%, while bitcoin has gone up around 90%. However, it is unlikely that ETH will take over in terms of market capitalization because bitcoin is the cryptocurrency with the most people behind it in terms of adoption and use. Many view bitcoin as digital gold and major corporations and institutional investors are adding it to their balance sheets. Ethereum is unscalable in its current iteration and acts more as a platform for decentralized applications than a store of value"" Ben Weiss, president and COO of CoinFlip said.

The launch of an improved Ethereum network is a testament to the strength of the project — but also represents change. Change conveys risk — while Bitcoin is simple, immutable, and constantly rising in value.

""I am not yet convinced DeFi is as groundbreaking as its followers deem it to be. The idea of yield farming sounds a great deal like smart contract hot potato with investors jumping from project to project, hoping they aren't the last ones to hold the bag,"" Don Wyper, COO at DigitalMint said.

Institutional investors have been key to driving the value of Bitcoin over the past 12 months. Will those same traditional investing giants turn their attention to Ethereum?

""Eventually some institutional investors will acquire ETH in order to expand their crypto exposure, while others will trade the recently launched CME ETH futures (interest is still low with volumes 8% of the CME BTC Futures). Others will acquire ETH in order to utilize and experiment with some of the applications, particularly in DeFi. However, I don't see much movement comparable to bitcoin in the near term,"" Jason Lau, COO at OKCoin said.

Conclusion

As many respondents pointed out, comparisons between Ethereum and Bitcoin make sense from an investor point of view, but the comparisons don't go much further than that.

""BTC and ETH are different: BTC is a currency token while the ETH is a utility token. If mainstream institutional investors get into ETH, it would mean that mainstream institutions validate not only the current value of ETH, but also the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. We have not seen signs of mainstream institutions being involved in Ethereum's applications. So, in order for institutional investors to get on board, it would take more time and market education throughout 2021 and beyond,"" Haohan Xu, CEO of Apifiny said

It may take a shift in mainstream understanding — or even a mild learning curve — to get traditional investors who have tried the familiar Bitcoin to understand the power of DeFi, but it seems the mighty bull run market is raising all ships in the cryptoworld and institutional investors are already getting on board.

""Institutional investors are already getting on board with Ethereum. Just recently, Grayscale, the world's largest Crypto asset manager, purchased more Ethereum than Bitcoin for a change. Chinese public firm Meitu also grabbed 15K of Ether not too long ago. Galaxy Digital's ETH funds raised 32 Million in less than a month. The launch of Ethereum Futures on the CME, the launch of Canadian ETH ETFs, and we're just scratching the surface here… I anticipate a further surge of institutional investments in Ethereum. This is just the beginning,"" Greenberg said.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $56,327.79-$59,242.58 (CoinDesk 20)

BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.

Bitcoin’s price struggled to push higher after briefly touching $59,000 when markets opened in the U.S. on Friday.

Investors continued to monitor the potential fallout from U.S. Treasury bond yields, which some analysts warn could lead to a correction in risky assets from bitcoin to stocks.

The 10-year Treasury note yield went as high as 1.74% on Friday, the highest since January 2020, after the Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday it would keep loose monetary policy for the foreseeable future.

“If we continue to see the U.S. bond market questioning the Fed forward guidance, it could lead to more downside pressure in risk assets and start to weigh on bitcoin by extension,” Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk. “We think this is a risk worth considering, especially with bitcoin already having moved so far and fast in 2021 thus far.”

Price charts also are sending signals the oldest cryptocurrency might be losing steam, with patterns appearing that suggest the market is reaching an overbought condition, according to analysts with Cryptowatch, a unit of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.

The Fed’s reaffirmation of its pledge to keep monetary policy loose theoretically should benefit bitcoin’s price in the short term. A growing number of investors are betting bitcoin might act as a hedge against inflation. Many Wall Street economists expect inflation will escalate once more people start going out and spur an economic recovery thanks to the coronavirus vaccine. But rising U.S. Treasury bond yields could create extra selling pressure for bitcoin along with traditional risky assets.

“If rates go higher, it will force investors to rethink their long equity exposure and could open a big sell-off in stocks,” Kruger said. “And as things stand in the short term, because bitcoin is still a maturing asset, it still shares correlations with risk sentiment. So bitcoin would be somewhat exposed if something like this played out.”

Bitcoin options open interest Source: Skew

In the bitcoin derivatives market, options open interest remained high above $14 billion after reaching an all-time high on Wednesday.

It “indicates that this week’s price rally could be more speculative,” said Yves Renno, head of trading at Wirex, who also noted that the bitcoin December’s futures contract is currently quoted at a much higher price than bitcoin’s spot price.

“If there are no significant events that take place and shake the market again, such as new legislation that would favour the issuance of the first U.S. exchange-traded fund (ETF), or a new large tech player entering the crypto economy, then there seems to be very little fundamental support for a new bitcoin rally in the short-term,” Renno said.

Ether outperforms bitcoin as more BTCs are locked on Ethereum

Total bitcoin locked in the decentralized finance sector Source: DeFi Pulse

Ether (ETH) was up on Friday, trading around $1,828.06 and climbing 3.20% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Alternative coins (altcoins) tend to see more price action after bitcoin logs new record high prices.

That happens because some traders and investors try to rotate into altcoins when bitcoin isn’t popping, in pursuit of potentially higher returns.

Bitcoin has doubled this year, while ether saw more than 140% year-to-date returns, based on CoinDesk 20 pricing.

Notably, the total number of bitcoin locked in decentralized finance, which is largely based on the Ethereum blockchain, saw a sharp increase Friday, up 30% to 33,578 from a day ago, according to data from DeFi Pulse.

Ethereum has defended a key support level but remains weaker.

Ripple price had several price spikes in the past week that led nowhere.

In the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market managed to recover about 80$ billion in market capitalization reaching $1.81 trillion. The next target is the astronomical $2 trillion capitalization level.

Most cryptocurrencies are in the green today while Bitcoin’s dominance continues declining, dropping 2 percentage points in the past week.

Bitcoin price faces weak resistance ahead as bulls keep the momentum

On the daily chart, the uptrend has been kept intact and Bitcoin held the key support level at $53,700, the 26-EMA. This moving average has served as an accurate guide for the bulls throughout this recent bull rally.

BTC/USD daily chart

The only resistance point is the previous all-time high of $61,844. A breakout above this point should swiftly drive Bitcoin price towards $70,000 and up to $76,200 at the 127.2% Fibonacci level.

On the other hand, losing the key 26-EMA support level at $53,650 would push Bitcoin price down to at least $50,450 at the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement level and as low as $41,554.

Ethereum price remains flat in the short-term

In the past week, Ethereum has been trading sideways but remains contained inside an ascending broadening wedge pattern on the 12-hour chart. There is a critical support level at $1,700 which coincides with the 50-SMA and the 100-SMA levels.

ETH/USD 12-hour chart

Holding this key support point should push Ethereum higher. The short-term resistance is located at $1,944, a breakout above this level should push ETH towards the all-time high of $2,042. Further than that, the next price target would be the top trendline of the pattern at $2,423.

On the other hand, a breakdown below the key support level at $1,700 would drive Ethereum price down to the lower boundary of the pattern at $1,520.

Ripple price hits a robust barrier once again

XRP has been rejected from a key resistance level at $0.488 several times in the past month. On the 12-hour chart, the digital asset formed an ascending triangle pattern.

XRP/USD 12-hour chart

A breakdown below the lower trendline support at $0.444 will drive Ripple price down to $0.36. However, if bulls can finally crack the key resistance level of $0.488, the digital asset will quickly explode towards a high of $0.581.","The Deutsche Bank said that Bitcoin is too important to ignore at the moment, thanks to the cryptocurrency’s increasing market cap

Deutsche Bank believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has become an important asset, making it impossible to ignore it at this point. The leading cryptocurrency has gained more than 1000% since falling below the $4,000 mark in March 2020. It is currently trading close to the $60,000 mark and has a market cap above $1 trillion.

The rising market cap means that it can no longer be ignored. The bank is bullish about the cryptocurrency and sees its price soaring higher. In its report published on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank said that Bitcoin’s price could continue to increase as it attracts entry from asset managers and companies.

Despite its bullish stance on cryptocurrency, Deutsche Bank is convinced that BTC will remain volatile due to its limited tradability. Although Bitcoin was created to be a medium of exchange, it has become more of an asset in recent years. Deutsche Bank revealed that less than 30% of transactional activity in BTC is related to payments. Thus, implying that most people hold the cryptocurrency as an asset.

Bitcoin still has a long way to go before it can challenge the traditional fiat system. The bank revealed that the average number of Bitcoin transactions in terms of US dollar daily is equivalent to only 0.05% of yen and 0.06% of GBP.

Deutsche Bank believes that the leading cryptocurrency’s current valuation makes it an excellent candidate to serve as a cross-border currency. However, it must show its value as a means of payment to live up to that reputation.

Major banks globally are slowly entering the crypto space and offering services to retail and institutional investors. Deutsche Bank doesn’t want to be left behind and plans to develop a fully integrated custody platform designed to cater to institutional clients and their digital assets.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bank of America recently released a report that unpacks their thoughts on Bitcoin.

The bank identified five critical issues that prevent BTC from being a truly valuable asset.

Analysts at the firm did, however, write a glowing review of the DeFi space.

While Citibank praised Bitcoin’s potential, analysts at Bank of America published a damning indictment of the biggest cryptocurrency.

They do, however, see much more promise in DeFi.

Bank of America Bearish on Bitcoin

Central Bank Digital Currencies Will Replace Bitcoin

Several central banks are actively working on CBDC, with countries such as China and the UAE even preparing inter-operability between their national digital currencies. Bank of America described the move as “defending their territory from cryptocurrencies,” suggesting that CBDCs would quickly replace private cryptocurrencies whose use could be restricted.

After heavy restrictions, BoA adds that citizens will turn to CBDCs as they provide users with governmental backing and a far less volatile asset.

Bitcoin Is Still Too Volatile

According to Bank of America, Bitcoin should have already reached maturity as an asset. As witnessed during last March’s Covid crash, the massive swings in value suggest that Bitcoin can’t be a store of value.

The firm writes that Bitcoin’s volatility is higher than forex, gold, or silver and shows no sign of slowing down as 2021 is the second most volatile year to date.

Bitcoin Is an Environmental Disaster

The price of Bitcoin is directly correlated to its energy consumption, BoA analysts argue. “Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world’s 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan.”

This is a very debatable claim as the truth about the environmental impact of Bitcoin is much more complex and not as directly correlated to price.

Whales Dominate Crypto

BoA reports that 2.4% of addresses hold 95% of the Bitcoin supply while the rest are mostly empty, comparing this to the top 1 percent of Americans who hold 30% of all household wealth.

This number fails to consider that a majority of investors do not hold their own Bitcoin but often trust exchanges to do so.

The issue of calculating Bitcoin concentration through this metric is that one address isn’t necessarily one person. In the 2.4% number, these addresses can hold the funds of thousands of customers. This can work both ways as, similarly, there is no limitation of the accounts that one person can open. An active trader might use several addresses and leave some empty, for instance.

On-chain analytics firm Glassnode estimates the amount of Bitcoin held by each category of Bitcoin holders as the following (the numbers on the left represent BTC holdings):

Bitcoin Doesn’t Scale

BoA compares Bitcoin’s total output of roughly 300,000 transactions per day to Visa’s stated 236 million transactions per hour. As trading is supported by mining to ensure the settlement process, the Bitcoin network’s speed will always be capped, limiting its potential to scale.

This fails to take into account the effort to develop Bitcoin’s second layer through projects like Lightning Network, which effectively allows infinite transactions per second, limited only by the speed and capacity of nodes.

Additionally, Bitcoin transactions and Visa transactions are very different, and people do not use them for the same type of transactions.

In Citibank’s report, their analysts argued that comparing Bitcoin and Visa transactions was akin to comparing international trade transfers and buying cups of coffee. The two networks are used for very different purposes, and the value proposition of a decentralized blockchain network was not the same as a credit card company, nor does it pretend to be.

Bank of America Bullish on DeFi

Despite the scathing analysis of Bitcoin, the bank suggested that DeFi could “potentially be more disruptive than Bitcoin.”

According to their analysts, while the DeFi space still has a long way to go, it could challenge centralized financial institutions in the long term. They still highlight the issue of scalability on the Ethereum blockchain, something that developers are working hard on for the release of Ethereum 2.0.

The rich want in on the cryptocurrency action. Banks want happy customers. So it’s perfectly natural that the wheels have been put in motion for Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) to offer crypto access to its clients.

But the plan does come with some interesting stipulations. Morgan Stanley crypto investors have to meet a litany of qualifications to be able to gain access to Bitcoin.

For starters, no newbies. Account holders must be clients for at least six months to be able to gain crypto exposure. This seems odd because the big bank won’t be able to use crypto access to draw in new customers. But because Morgan Stanley is the first major U.S. bank to grant access to clients, it’s treading lightly at first.

Secondly, the plan is for Morgan Stanley to offer crypto access only to those with “an aggressive risk tolerance.” It’s almost as if the bank is warning its clients to stay away from crypto. Even those who fit the bill will be allowed to invest only 2.5% of their total net worth in crypto.

Lastly, and here’s the big catch… only those with at least $2 million in assets held by the bank will be allowed to invest in crypto. The rich folks either too busy or too incompetent to venture into the world of crypto on their own finally got their bankers to do it. As funny as all of this is, it’s actually good news for Bitcoin bulls.

Behind the Decision for Morgan Stanley to Offer Crypto

Morgan Stanley has been crypto curious for a while now. Back in 2017, when initial coin offerings (ICOs) were happening by the hour and cryptocurrencies were on the tip of everyone’s tongue, Morgan Stanly floated an idea. The bank wanted to launch an investment tool that would be tied to Bitcoin. But the plan was scrapped. And the bank’s interest in crypto appeared to fade for a spell.

This announcement for Morgan Stanley to offer crypto access came shortly after another announcement. Counterpoint Global, which is a unit of Morgan Stanley, was exploring if and how it could make a bet on Bitcoin.

At the time, it seemed unlikely considering the regulators and the bank as a whole would need to sign off on it. But it signaled an increasing desire for Wall Street to get into crypto. And that desire appears to be on the cusp of being fulfilled.

According to the memo, Morgan Stanley will enable ownership of Bitcoin to its clients through three funds. Galaxy Digital, which was founded by former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, runs two of the funds. The third is overseen by a partnership between FS Investments and NYDIG – two alternative investment outfits.

Galaxy Digital was established for the purpose of offering diversified financial services in digital assets, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Created in 2018, the firm touts itself as “the bridge between crypto and the institutional worlds.” This move by Morgan Stanley firmly cements Galaxy as doing just that.

The FS Investments and NYDIG partnership fund is another strong way into the crypto world. NYDIG is known for its secure Bitcoin ownership and management platform. And FS Investments is well-known for its ability to streamline crypto investing. Together, the duo will allow Morgan Stanley clients an easy point of entry to crypto.

Crypto’s Push Into the Mainstream

The move by Morgan Stanley to offer crypto is merely the latest in a list of institutions entering the crypto space. Mastercard (NYSE: MA) announced it would be bringing crypto onto its network. Crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a thing now. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) went in big on Bitcoin and plans to accept it as payment for its vehicles. Despite digital currency derision from CEO Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) launched a digital coin of its own not long ago. The Dallas Mavericks recently announced it would accept Dogecoin for ticket and merchandise purchases.

On top of all of this widespread crypto adoption, there are the increasingly popular crypto-adjacent non-fungible tokens (NFTs). And here’s an explanation of NFTs. These tokens that are tied works of digital art operate on blockchain technology. And they’re minting new millionaires all over the place. Legendary auction house Christie’s has even gotten in on the action. They’re becoming a popular asset class in their own right. And that’s only helping push crypto as a whole further into the mainstream.

As NYDIG CEO Robert Gutmann pointed out in a press release, institutional adoption of Bitcoin is expanding. Despite this, financial advisors don’t have many options to add crypto to their clients’ portfolios. But Morgan Stanley is looking to change that. This could be a watershed moment for crypto – or more specifically Bitcoin. If and when other big banks start granting crypto exposure to everyday investors, regulators are going to come knocking. Maybe then government agencies will finally come up with a cohesive classification of crypto…

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network doesn’t consider crypto to be legal tender. The SEC considers crypto to be a security. And the IRS views crypto as property. But at the same time, that’s kind of perfect for a decentralized digital token.

The Bottom Line on the Plan for Morgan Stanley to Offer Crypto

This news doesn’t mean much for most Investment U readers. At least not yet… but it could (should?) be just the impetus for those on the crypto fence to consider getting in on their own. The beauty and the blemish of Bitcoin is that most institutions didn’t want to have anything to do with it. That’s led to a lot of volatility (both up and down). And it’s scared investors away.

On top of that, there is a bit of a learning curve. Crypto novices have to navigate exchanges. Then they need to figure out the best crypto wallet to store their digital currency. But the learning curve is proving to be worth it. And it’s not a bad idea to get over that learning curve before the rest of the institutional money starts pouring in.

The dynamic might hold if bitcoin stays in a bull market, the firm predicts.","SBI Crypto, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Japan's SBI Holdings, has opened its bitcoin mining pool for the public.

The move means institutions and individuals looking to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can join the SBI Crypto Pool service.

SBI Crypto has been self-mining bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and bitcoin SV since August 2017. Its bitcoin mining pool is currently ranked eleventh and has a hashrate of 2.44 exahash per second (EH/s), per BTC.com.

SBI Crypto said part of its pool's service had been developed with its partner Northern Data AG to complement data center management services. SBI first partnered with Northern Data last July by becoming its strategic shareholder.

The SBI pool appears to be the second well-known pool to open for the public after Digital Currency Group's Foundry. After months of operating its pool in private beta mode, Foundry last week opened its public service.

Bitcoin miners have been raking in millions of dollars in revenue given the cryptocurrency's recent rally. According to data compiled by The Block, bitcoin miners made an all-time high revenue of $1.36 billion in February. For this month so far, their revenue has been nearly $1 billion.

Bitcoin is currently trading at around $58,500, according to TradingView.","The bank will offer its own custody service later this year.

Bank of New York Mellon has invested in Fireblocks, a startup that specializes in cryptocurrency safekeeping. The bank's investment is part of a $133-million funding round, Reuters reported.

The bank is preparing to offer cryptocurrency custody services—storing and handling funds on behalf of customers—for the first time later this year. It's the world's largest custodian, looking after $41 trillion in client assets.

Fireblocks is reportedly part of BNY Mellon's custody plans, according to unnamed sources cited by CoinDesk. The bank has said it would work with external partners to offer some of its cryptocurrency services. Neither the bank not Fireblocks have confirmed working together beyond the investment.

Besides custody, Fireblocks also offers a suite of ""tokenization"" services, which convert financial instruments to blockchain-based assets. This includes a tokenization ""engine"" that allows users to create security tokens and stablecoins, assets on a blockchain that represent securities like equities or bonds, and assets that mimic the price of an existing fiat currency, respectively.

BNY Mellon has said it would offer tokenized securities as part of its cryptocurrency services. This will be done by a new team that will explore additional services like lending against crypto collateral.

""We are starting with the anchor in this space, which is custody,"" the head of BNY Mellon's crypto unit, Mike Demissie, said in February.

The Fireblocks funding round values the company at nearly $1 billion, according to an unnamed source with knowledge of the matter cited by Reuters. Other investors in the round include Ribbit, Coatue, Stripes and SVB.

Deutsche Bank is also developing a crypto custody service as part of a larger offering, which will include trading. Major Wall Street names are increasingly involved in cryptocurrencies: Morgan Stanley is offering wealthy clients access to Bitcoin funds for the first time, while JPMorgan has developed a structured product to capture cryptocurrency exposure. Goldman Sachs has restarted a Bitcoin futures trading desk."
2021-03-20,"The Indian government is sending mixed signals about how it plans to regulate cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.

Government officials say they are still figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrency. At worst, some reports suggest India might criminalize Bitcoin ownership and use of the currency entirely. Either way, the Indian Bitcoin community offers a stark contrast to stereotypes about Bitcoin as the preserve of criminals and tech bros.

Before the pandemic, American Bitcoin circles were known for the same frat-party culture that once dominated Wall Street and Silicon Valley. There’s even a stereotype that the crypto rich all drive Lamborghinis, but anyone looking to India for Bitcoin playboys with lambos will be disappointed. Unocoin crypto-exchange investor Arpit Agarwal of Blume Ventures still drives a Maruti Suzuki Swift. Plus, he’s been married for nine years.

One of the reasons that India’s crypto millionaires aren’t flaunting their wealth may also be that many of them are making long-term bets, rather than speculating for short-term profits, on how this technology will increase India’s prominence in global markets.

CRYPTO-SAVVY is a series from Inverse that explains the world of cryptocurrency and where it’s going next.

“Every time Bitcoin has a jump in price, I see it as a validation of my thesis. Even when it goes down, I know a lot of people are still transacting and institutions are still adopting, so I see no reason to exit,” Agarwal tells Inverse.

He also points to other issues with exchanging fiat currencies, like rupees and dollars, that he hopes cryptocurrency can eventually solve.

“Especially regarding the supply of currency across borders, there are hundreds of use cases that haven’t been solved because the countries don’t want to trust each other and there’s no neutral authority to build the trust,” Agarwal says. “This problem can be completely reimagined using cryptocurrency.”

Inside India’s Bitcoin boom

According to data from the peer-to-peer exchange platforms LocalBitcoins and Paxful, India is now the second-fastest growing Bitcoin market in Asia, garnering more than $53 million in quarterly transaction volume. Agarwal is a bit of an anomaly in India, because he views Bitcoin as an asset class for long-term holding. Rather than predominantly using exchange platforms, like cryptocurrency users do in North America, he says lots of Indian retail users seem to be buying Bitcoin from each other.

Agarwal hasn’t cashed out of his 4-year-old Bitcoin position, so his lifestyle hasn’t changed even as his cryptocurrency holdings appreciated dramatically. Instead, Agarwal says he is grateful to his wife for suggesting they take Bitcoin seriously as a savings tool.

“We never would have had these opportunities if we had done it the traditional way.”

Agarwal isn’t alone. Kavita Gupta, an Indian woman who splits her time between Delhi, New York, and San Francisco, recently launched a crypto-centric TV program in India through FinTech TV. Gupta, who previously worked with legacy institutions like the International Finance Corporation, tells Inverse that working in the crypto industry is “empowering” because traditional payment rails feel “like a system from a different century.”

There’s also Jalak Jobanputra who invested in four Indian crypto startups and recently moved to a stylish bungalow in Miami. The value of her investments surged during the pandemic bull market, yet Jobanputra still doesn’t own a car. She tells Inverse she’d rather use ride-sharing apps and spend her money on Bitcoin.

“I’ve been investing since the early days of the internet,” Jobanputra says. “So I wouldn’t say it [cryptocurrency gains] was life-changing from that perspective, but we built this network of smart people, worldwide, and that's been personally so invigorating.”

There are certainly Indian Bitcoin users who also own fancy cars. It’s just that they aren’t “typical” of the user base. We rarely hear about Bitcoin users who didn’t do anything flashy or extravagant to flaunt their newfound social mobility. For example, Woodstock Fund co-founder Pranav Sharma in India, who tells Inverse his blockchain-focused venture fund grew from $750,000 in 2019 to a portfolio worth more than $25 million by 2021, is still driving the same Mahindra SUV he had before his first bull run in 2017. He’s in the same house too.

Sharma, 38, lives near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, a South Indian state. The way he splurged with his crypto wealth, over the past few years, was by reducing his workload to eight hours a day and taking his wife on a spiritual retreat to Varanasi.

“It helped me reach my financial goals,” Sharma says of his Bitcoin investment. “You can eat good food made at home. You can do yoga in the morning. In the corporate world I was working closer to 12 hours a day.”

A new Bitcoin leisure class

Instead of buying Lamborghinis, thousands of Bitcoin users around the world opted for more financial freedom by working less or launching their own companies. Unocoin CEO Sathvik Vishwanath, who runs one of India’s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, says more than 15,000 retail users like Aggarwal earned cryptocurrency gains exceeding $20,000 since the exchange launched in 2013.

“I would consider $20,000 to be a life-changing amount in India,” Vishwanath tells Inverse, adding that only 2 percent of the platform's 1.3 million user accounts were already high net worth individuals.

“We do have a few hundred institutions that have signed up and have done investments and transactions in the past,” he says, “but it is nothing compared with the institutional interest we are seeing in developed countries like the U.S.”

29-year-old Akshay Aggarwal is another Indian crypto investor who’s made life-changing amounts of money by trading on Unocoin.

“I got into the crypto space in September 2015,” Aggarwal tells Inverse. Back then, the price of Bitcoin was under $334. “In hindsight, I definitely didn’t expect it would ever go back to $7,500, which is where I sold off. Since seeing the first cycle, I kept on buying as active traders would.”

Although one Bitcoin is now valued at more than $54,000, Aggarwal lives with his parents while he works as the founder of his own consulting startup, Blocumen Studios, and an educational initiative called Blockchained India. He estimates the latter group includes 33,000 participants across Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, and an email list.

“Whatever I got out of the holding, I sold,” Aggarwal says. “I mostly used it for the community we were running until January 2018. It was similar in the case of the other co-founder of my community, we expanded it to Bangalore to create a four-city network.”

Aggarwal’s projects have enough runway to keep going for the foreseeable future. In his mind, the exchange was worth it because he established a career he loves, with enviable job security, despite the pandemic. The truth is, a male Bitcoin user is just as likely to prioritize quiet family life as he is to fulfill any “hilariously rich” tech bro stereotype.

Such is the case noticed with Bluzelle CEO Pavel Bains in Singapore, who tells Inverse the big difference Bitcoin made in his life since he first bought some in 2014 is he can now “afford to spend time with my kids, and I don’t worry about school fees.” (He doesn’t own a car either.)

Bains moved to Singapore in 2016 to build his blockchain startup, and says he found more flexible work opportunities in the blockchain space than he did in the video-game industry, where he previously worked.

“Cryptocurrency accelerated my ability to build a company,” Bains says. “When I think about the other people I met in the space, we never would have had these opportunities if we had done it the traditional way.”

Correction: This article was updated on 3/21/2021 to accurately reflect how long Arpit Agarwal has held his current Bitcoin investments.","Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) has rewarded investors with stellar returns over the past year, making it enticing for newcomers to jump in and see how much they could ""win."" So far, the cryptocurrency has soared to new record highs every month of 2021 as more investors flock to Bitcoin to capture diversification and opportunity.

Now, there's another incentive that makes investing in Bitcoin an option for those who haven't dived in yet or those who simply want to add more to their portfolio: $1,400 stimulus checks. On March 11, President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act, authorizing $1,400 stimulus checks to eligible taxpayers and dependents of all ages.

If you're tempted to spend your entire stimulus check on Bitcoin, here are a few items you should consider before your $1,400 leaves your checking account.

Check on your financial house

It's easy to wake up, see thousands of extra dollars in your account, invest in the hottest assets, and kick all your financial responsibilities to the curb. But don't be so quick to make moves in the market when you haven't taken care of your financial affairs.

First, make sure you've paid all your bills and have some funds set aside to carry you for the next couple of months. The worst thing you could do is throw all your money into Bitcoin, watch the price fall a few weeks later, and be forced to sell at a loss because you're in dire need of the funds.

Take some time out to look at your income and expenses over the next few months. Then, look at your assets and debt. Are you in the best position to invest right now? You can review the numbers yourself or work with a professional who can help you reveal blind spots in your financial plan.

Understand your investing goals and the potential risks

If you're ready to invest, you should identify your investing goals in order to create the best plan for you. Don't just invest in Bitcoin and other assets because everyone else is doing it. The clearer you are about your investing goals, the easier it will be to choose assets that align with them.

Then, consider the risks. Bitcoin has delivered big profits, but the journey hasn't always been filled with consistent victories. This cryptocurrency is very volatile, quickly undergoing daily dips and climbs that can come when you least expect it. So, if you need the money next month, you may be taking on a big risk. Also, you might be stuck with a huge tax tab that could eat into your profits if you sell too soon and are in a high tax bracket.

Start with a little bit of money

If you've checked the box on the above items and understand what you are getting into, then you can determine how much to invest in Bitcoin if it's the right fit for your portfolio.

Right now, the price of bitcoin is a little over $56,000. Fortunately, you can buy fractional amounts and grab a piece of Bitcoin for $100 or $1,000. It's up to you how much you invest. If you have the extra funds available to grab shares of Bitcoin, it provides a great opportunity to earn while you learn. Then, you can set up an investing strategy where you contribute a little bit more each month.

So, take a look at your finances and see how much you can comfortably invest. Remember, you should not invest what you can't afford to lose. Like most other assets in the marketplace, there is no guarantee of profit and you can lose all your money. But on the other hand, don't be so afraid of losing that you miss out on an incredible learning opportunity. Bitcoin has been one of the best-performing assets of our time and the technology behind this cryptocurrency could revolutionize financial services.

Make the best decision for you

At the end of the day, it's your money and you want to put yourself in a position to maximize every dollar that flows through your pocket. Take care of your financial house and make prudent investment decisions that can put you in a better financial position later.

Bitcoin's meteoric rise is impressive and the potential for even more gains is very alluring. But don't be so focused on missing out that you fail to see the opportunities ahead. There will always be opportunities in the market. But you want to ensure that you manage your financial foundation first so that you start using more of your money to make more money with ease.","4 Cryptocurrencies To Watch If You Believe Digital Currencies Are The Future

Cryptocurrency. When you hear this word, you would most likely think of Bitcoin. Of course, this comes as no surprise as Bitcoin was the first-ever cryptocurrency to hit the market. And it has been gaining popularity ever since. For those unfamiliar, a cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency. Recently, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has made the announcement that it would begin accepting Bitcoin as payment. Prices of BTC have since soared after the announcement hitting a record high of USD 61,000 before retreating to the current level of over $58,000 USD. To put things into context, Bitcoin was only worth about USD 5,000 this time last year. That’s right. It has returned more than 1,000% in a year.

Why is crypto a hot topic in the investment world? It’s no secret that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. But hey, with high risk comes high reward, isn’t it? Early adopters of Bitcoin would have made a huge profit, assuming they have held on. Ask any investor today, they would want to get a piece of it if it weren’t that expensive. With all the buzz going around cryptocurrencies, it seems like there’s a high chance that these digital assets could potentially be the future of money in transactions.

Institutional Investors’ Involvement A Catalyst To Cryptocurrencies

Institutional investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class. After all, they are looking to maximize their returns in the difficult investment climate we face in the stock market today. Aside from Tesla, other major companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) have been making moves to accept cryptocurrencies for transactions. With the increasing participation from institutional players, this certainly bodes well for the industry. It may not even be so far-fetched to think that cryptocurrencies would eventually be the currencies of the future.

As of January, there were over 4,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence. With so many cryptocurrencies out there, there’s no question that it creates a lot of complexity. However, with the proper research and due diligence, investors could still score big with some of the hottest cryptos in the market. If you want to get into cryptocurrencies, these 4 cryptos have run circles around Bitcoin and could continue to bring massive gains.

4 CryptocurrenciesTo Watch In March 2021

Cardano (ADA) Stellar (XLM) Avalanche (AVAX) Dogecoin (DOGE)

Cardano (ADA)

First, on the list, we have cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA). Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain where it requires validation for transactions and the validators are required to “stake” some of their ADA coins. The cryptocurrency has grown in popularity and is becoming one of the largest cryptocurrencies right now, right on the heels of Ethereum.

There are few reasons why Cardano rose exponentially and gained strong momentum as of late. First, there was an announcement this week stating that Cardano will hit Coinbase Pro, a leading crypto exchange. Recall that in late July 2020, Cardano launched Shelly, which is an upgrade of its network. This upgrade is designed to increase the number of nodes which translates to more decentralization thus improving security on the Cardano network.

The reveal that Cardano is supporting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on its platform is also worth the mention. For the uninitiated, NFTs allow users to prove ownership of digital media like art, files, and so on. NFTs have become increasingly relevant in the market. So this news is great for boosting Cardano’s popularity. If you want to strike while the iron is hot, now may be a time for you to consider Cardano coin in your portfolio.

Stellar (XLM)

Next up, Stellar is a blockchain-based distributor ledger network that uses its currency, XLM coins for transactions between financial institutions and people. At its heart, the Stellar Lumens network aims to make cross-border payments frictionless. It has received a fair amount of attention as of late.

Stellar stands out due to its incredible payment network speed. For traditional international transactions, it typically takes a few days to complete the transaction but Stellar can complete it in a matter of seconds. This has improved the efficiency of supply chain payments significantly which makes it a very attractive platform to work with.

Early 2021 January, Stellar announced it is working with the Ukrainian government in creating a central bank digital currency. While there is no guarantee that Stellar will be responsible for developing the currency, it is most likely that Stellar will play a critical role in the decision-making process. Given the developments that are taking place in Stellar, would you be adding this cryptocurrency to your watchlist?

Avalanche (AVAX)

Avalanche is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform that allows interoperability between third-party tokens. Simply put, Avalanche is a blockchain-based platform where issuers can process more transactions than Ethereum at a much faster rate but at a lower cost. Thus, the AVAX network has greatly improved the DeFi environment with a permissionless system where users can create their customized blockchains, both private or public.

One reason why we have seen strong price action on Avalanche in recent months can be attributed to Pangolin, the community-driven decentralized exchange. Pangolin showcases the capabilities of Avalanche and is also an important piece of Avalanche’s DeFi ecosystem. This attracts a plethora of DeFi users that are overwhelmed by high fees and network congestion.

Avalanche may be a fairly new cryptocurrency in the market. But the potential it has is very exciting for the blockchain world. With all the optimistic plans being set in motion, will you be adding this cryptocurrency to your portfolio?

Dogecoin (DOGE)

Dogecoin initially started off in late 2013 as a digital joke which is a combination of cryptocurrency and a popular Shiba Inu dog meme. In fact, it was created in a few hours by two programmers, Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus. Dogecoin holders can use Dogecoin to buy goods and services or trade them for other currencies. Holders also use Dogecoin to “tip” fellow internet-goers who create or share great content.

Dogecoin recently gained a huge boost in popularity after being constantly tweeted by Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. Musk also mentioned that he wants Coinbase to add Dogecoin to its list of supported cryptocurrencies. And it wasn’t just Musk who voiced his support for Dogecoin. Popular rapper Snoop Dogg has also rebranded himself as Snoop Doge. This came shortly after Kiss rock star Gene Simmons tweeted about Dogecoin. Ridiculous as it may sound, the price of Dogecoin soared more than 55% after the publicity.

Dogecoin can be fickle and investors have been saying repeatedly of its high volatility. With the current state of momentum, dogecoin prices may continue to soar if more celebrities join in on the hype train but that is speculative at best.

Here is a list of some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch and their performance from this past week by the percentage change at around 9 a.m. Saturday, Mar. 20.

Bitcoin BTC | $59,180.01

Bitcoin's bull run continues rolling as it eclipsed all-time highs in recent weeks, hitting over $61,000, leading to more institutional investor interest this past month.

Ethereum ETH | $1,842.54

A change to the way Ethereum transaction fees are handled would reduce the circulating supply of Ether by July.

Cardano ADA | $1.27

Cardano became available on Coinbase this past week sending the price of the cryptocurrency higher, with it up over 21% over the last week.

Dogecoin DOGE | $0.059

Dogecoin is up over the past week and this past month TheStreet spoke with analyst Kenny Polcari about his problem with Dogecoin.

Binance Coin BNB | $270.17

The price of Binance Coin is up over 2% over the past week despite being down over 18% over the past month.

Litecoin LTC | $204.59

South African cryptocurrency exchange iCE3 halted withdrawals from Bitcoin and Litecoin this past week after finding ""discrepancies"", according to Coindesk.

XRP continues its fight with the SEC about whether it's a currency that started this past December. The SEC is pushing to get personal financial information from Ripple executives, according to Bloomberg.

All cryptocurrency price performances are referenced and pulled from Coinbase.","A dark horse cryptocurrency called Cardano is getting quite a bit of attention after a massive spike that preceded a significant correction this week.

Yashu Gola at NewsBTC reports that Cardano (ticker: ADA) reached a high of $1.49 before erasing half of those gains in a descending triangle that Gola describes as a “cascade of selling orders” that brought the value down about 21 percent.

To put that in perspective, as we were ringing in the new year, ADA was at all-time highs of $0.17.

With that in mind, some traders are considering the upsides to Cardano, for instance, the ability of holders to participate in non-fungible token or NFT markets. There’s also the assessment of the coin as greener then big crypto platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with its proof of stake concept replacing the energy-intensive proof of work designs of the front running cryptocurrencies.

However, others point to shortcomings in Cardano’s potential for becoming a rival altcoin, including what one writer calls the “network effect.”

“A better ecosystem may not be enough (for ADA),” Vince Martin writes for InvestorPlace. “Simply put, that’s the way of the world. Betamax was reputedly better than VHS, and it cost Sony billions of dollars to make Blu-Ray triumph over HD-DVD. Few consumers believe McDonald’s makes the best hamburgers, even among fast-food chains. That issue is magnified for a cryptocurrency. … More users and more owners means more developers. That in turn means more projects, more use cases, and thus more users and more owners, and so on. Bitcoin’s move to a “store of value” concept perhaps makes it less of a direct competitor to Cardano. The two cryptos can co-exist. But Ethereum has a big lead, and Ethereum 2.0 will add some of the features that make Cardano attractive.”

Martin also cites “limited capabilities” that could create headwinds for Cardano’s development.

“Cardano ‘is still a work in progress.’” Martin writes, comparing Cardano’s track record to Ethereum’s well-developed ecosystem of smart contract functionalities. “Even its founder admits as such.”

Still, the upward potential of this “penny cryptocurrency” is tempting: for example, traders who feel that Bitcoin, at some $50,000 per coin, has too far to fall, ADA may be a safer wading in point to the cryptocurrency pool. Take a look.","The value of Cardano’s ADA was trading nearly 2 per cent higher after the cryptocurrency got listed on Coinbase retail traders for the first time.

As per the data on Coindesk, the digital currency was trading at $1.26, higher 1.78 per cent.

Earlier this week, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange had announced that ADA will begin trading on its platform from Thursday once sufficient supply of ADA is established.

On Friday, Coinbase in a tweet said, “Cardano (ADA) is launching on http://Coinbase.com and in the iOS and Android apps within the next 15 minutes. You may need to refresh your app to properly buy, sell, convert, send, receive, or store ADA. We will update when ADA is fully live.”

Cardano (ADA) is launching on https://t.co/bCG11KMQ6s and in the iOS and Android apps within the next 15 minutes. You may need to refresh your app to properly buy, sell, convert, send, receive, or store ADA. We will update when ADA is fully live. https://t.co/Zw1Cmn6N17 — Coinbase (@coinbase) March 19, 2021

ADA is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $40.3 billion. The first three positions are acquired by Bitcoin at $1.09 trillion, followed by Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) at $209 billion and $40 billion respectively.","An analyst at cryptocurrency research company Messari believes Ethereum (ETH) could outperform Bitcoin (BTC) to become the most valuable digital asset.

Ryan Watkins said during a recent interview with Fintech Today that the shift towards Ethereum 2.0 would bring about some changes in the cryptocurrency’s monetary guidelines, which may result in Ether becoming the dominant cryptocurrency in the future.

Bitcoin may always be the darling of the crypto space and certainly has enjoyed massive popularity and acceptance as a store of value, but Ethereum’s fortunes have generally kept pace with and possibly surpassed Bitcoin since the end of 2020.

Ethereum up 145% this year

Bitcoin’s distinct selling point as a “store of value” asset is the fact that its monetary policy can be predicted, Watkins said.

Bitcoin had rallied from more than $28,000 to over $58,000 since December last year. ETH has jumped from over $745 to more than $1800, an increase of around 240%.

ETH investors with strong optimism on the rollout of Ethereum 2.0 have done quite well since it was unveiled on Dec. 1. Its price has climbed over threefold from the end-of-day print to the present, or $1805 at the time of this writing. Also, the crypto has advanced 145% so far this year.

ETH: More secure than bitcoin

“I think that the shift to Ethereum 2.0 and proof of stake, which is kind of like a new way of securing the Ethereum blockchain… Ethereum may actually be more secure compared to Bitcoin”, Watkins said.

According to some analysts, Ethereum might be a better long-term investment than Bitcoin. Ethereum is second to Bitcoin in terms of popularity, but a recent Singapore study — which was published in the journal PLos One — showed that tends to be more stable and a better “safe-haven” investment during shaky economic times.

Ethereum has been arguably more bullish compared to Bitcoin itself, bringing a higher return on investment but still nowhere near former record peaks on the two crypto asset’s ratio.

From a low of $4,106 during the coronavirus market crash, Bitcoin has surged fourteen-fold to over $58,000. An increasing number of prominent investors view Bitcoin as a hedge against monetary inflation in the wake of COVID-19. Even Tesla and Square have hopped aboard the Bitcoin train.

Bitcoin's rally has set the stage for crypto exchange Coinbase to go public at a nearly $100 billion valuation. This is incredible, considering Coinbase was valued at $8 billion in October 2018.

For Bitcoin holders out there, Coinbase's listing is a big step toward mainstream crypto adoption. Its market debut will also shine a spotlight on one of today's most divisive investment topics. Ahead of this much-anticipated event, here are three things you should know about Coinbase.

1. A pioneer in the crypto economy

Coinbase began in 2012 as a way for people and businesses to send and receive Bitcoin from anywhere in the world. Since then, it has evolved into a one-stop shop for finance in the crypto world.

Along with its popular trading platform, Coinbase provides ""crypto-based products"" for staking, spending, saving, and borrowing -- all using crypto assets. In doing so, the company ""powers the crypto economy"" -- a new, open financial system built on top of Bitcoin, Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) and the thousands of other crypto assets.

On Coinbase, users can buy and sell over 45 types of crypto assets, and also send these crypto assets to other users on Coinbase's global platform. Using their crypto assets, customers can fund Coinbase Cards -- debit cards that users can use to pay at any merchant that accepts Visa. They can also put certain crypto assets to work, earning interest by holding them in their Coinbase account.

When Coinbase first launched, Bitcoin was nowhere as well-known as it is now. But Coinbase's bold bet on the Wild West of cryptocurrencies has paid off. According to its IPO prospectus, Coinbase today serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions and 115,000 ""ecosystem partners,"" a category that includes merchants, developers, and asset issuers. These customers are spread across 100 countries, giving Coinbase a truly global reach.

2. How Coinbase makes money

Coinbase makes money mainly through transaction fees and its subscriptions and services business. In 2020, transactions generated 86% of total revenue, while subscriptions and services accounted for 4%.

Every time users buy, sell, or withdraw assets on Coinbase, they pay a transaction fee. These fees vary based on the price and quantity of crypto assets involved in that particular transaction. As a result, transaction revenue depends on the trading volume on Coinbase, as well as the volatility of cryptoasset prices. Take 2020, for example. Transaction revenue rose 137% year over year, driven by 142% growth in trading volume. While this represents rapid growth, investors should also expect revenue from this segment to fluctuate -- and sometimes wildly -- subject to the whims of the volatile crypto market.

Coinbase's subscription and service business, on the other hand, provides a steadier stream of revenue. The company earns fees for crypto assets it holds under custody and generates income by validating crypto transactions. The company also earns license revenue from its data analytics tool, which law enforcement agencies and financial institutions use to monitor blockchain transactions. While this business generates just 4% of Coinbase's total revenue, it's growing fast at 126% year over year. Coinbase will need to expand this business to get a more stable source of profits.

3. Coinbase is just getting started

Between 2018 and 2020, assets on Coinbase's platform jumped more than tenfold -- rising from $7 billion to $90 billion. In 2020, as more investors piled into Bitcoin, Coinbase's revenue more than doubled to $1.3 billion.

While Coinbase's recent growth is nothing short of remarkable, what lies ahead is even more exciting.

According to its IPO prospectus, the total market cap of crypto assets was $782 billion as of Dec. 31, 2020. That's not even 1% of the global financial system, which is valued in the hundreds of trillions. As the technology powering crypto assets matures and new use cases emerge, the crypto economy should only grow. With a 12% market share of all crypto assets, Coinbase is well-positioned to ride this once-in-a-lifetime trend.

There are many ways Coinbase can do this. To start, it has huge headroom to grow retail accounts from its current base of 43 million users. The company sees ""anyone with a smartphone"" as a potential customer, giving it an addressable market of 3.5 billion people.

Coinbase can also add new crypto assets onto its platform. It currently supports about 90 crypto assets for trading or custody -- or just 1% of the 8,859 crypto assets out there, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Moreover, it could roll out new services such as a way for developers to integrate payments into their applications, boosting crypto transaction volume.

While Coinbase has huge opportunities, the road ahead isn't all clear. The growth of the crypto economy will depend on all sorts of factors, ranging from adoption and regulation to technology. What's more, the bulk of Coinbase's revenue is still transactional in nature. This means a slowdown in demand for Bitcoin -- or other cryptocurrencies -- could hugely impact its financial performance.

Bitcoin's price may have surged 300% in 2020, but there's no telling what will happen in 2021. Similarly, there's a risk Coinbase's future growth may not be as good as what it was last year. Investors should brace for up-and-down earnings performance.

Coinbase faces a rocky road ahead

As interest in crypto assets continues to rise, Coinbase wants to leverage its massive head start to become an even bigger player. It will go public at an opportune time, with a market valuation bigger than the New York Stock Exchange's owner, Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE); Nasdaq; and the London Stock Exchange.

But Coinbase is treading an unbeaten path in an emerging industry. Changes in technology, competitive threats, and regulatory risks could all derail its long-term growth outlook. So unless they have a crystal ball, Coinbase's investors may find themselves on a roller-coaster ride. And for most of us, it's probably best to stay on the sidelines for now.","Robinhood is planning to beef up its cryptocurrency staff this year amid an explosion of interest in trading digital coins, according to CEO Vlad Tenev.

The popular investment app has been hiring “a ton” of new staff as it works to roll out more cryptocurrency offerings — including the ability to move crypto assets to and from a user’s digital wallet, according to Tenev.

“We’re actually growing our crypto team hugely this year,” Tenev said during a virtual “fireside chat” Robinhood posted to YouTube Thursday. “The business has just been going through exponential growth. We really hit an inflection point this year.”

Tenev didn’t say exactly how many workers Robinhood will add to its crypto team, but he said the startup would be able to expand the operation faster when it has “hundreds of people” on board.

Robinhood’s crypto business has boomed this year as bitcoin prices soared and a growing number of major companies such as Tesla and Square added it to their balance sheets.

More than 6 million new customers traded cryptocurrency for the first time on Robinhood from the start of the year through mid-February, according to Tenev.

One of the crypto team’s top priorities is allowing Robinhood traders to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies through the platform — a feature that’s in high demand, Tenev said.

Users can currently only buy and sell crypto assets with cash in their Robinhood accounts. The company says it’s working on features that would let them transfer coins between their brokerage accounts and their own digital wallets.

“As much as people are bugging me on that on social media, I’m bugging our crypto team and our software engineers so we’re going to try to get that done as fast as possible,” Tenev said.

But Tenev said his company wants to make sure the platform is reliable and that those new features are safe before they’re rolled out to users. He noted that many traders don’t want to deal with the “very complicated” task of managing digital coins themselves.

Robinhood is expanding its crypto footprint after catching heat for blocking trades of GameStop and other so-called meme stocks in January. Tenev has said Robinhood only did so after getting a $3 billion demand from a Wall Street clearinghouse amid the unprecedented market frenzy.

2021-03-21,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been facing stiff resistance near the $60,000 level for the past few days. This suggests that market participants are cautious at these levels and a positive trigger may be needed to drive the price higher and start the next leg of the uptrend.

One of the developments that could be bullish for Bitcoin is that Brazil followed in the footsteps of Canada and gave the green light for the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The ETF will be managed by QR Asset Management and is expected to start trading in Q2 2021.

The Bitcoin ETFs launched by various countries are likely to put pressure on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a Bitcoin ETF because if they do not do that, institutional investors may use the alternatives available in neighboring countries.

Although Bitcoin is showing some fragility near $60,000, Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman analyzed derivatives data from various exchanges to show that top traders are still adding long positions near $57,000.

Bitcoin seems to be consolidating its recent gains before starting the next trending move. But there are several cryptocurrencies that are in an uptrend and may continue their march north. Let’s study the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that could remain bullish in the short term.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin is in an uptrend and the bulls continue to buy the dips to the 20-day exponential moving average ($55,282). The long tail on today’s candlestick also shows that the bulls used the dips to accumulate.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls will now try to propel the price above the $60,000 to $61,825 resistance. If they succeed, the BTC/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $72,112.

Another possibility is that the price again turns down from the overhead resistance and the pair remains stuck in a tight range. If that happens, the next breakout is likely to result in a strong trending move.

The only bearish development visible on the chart is the negative divergence on the relative strength indicator (RSI). This bearish prediction could come into play after the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA.

If that happens, the pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($49,497), which is a critical support to keep an eye on. A break below this level could challenge the $43,006 support.

The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. The price has bounced off the support line of the triangle, indicating that the bulls are defending this support.

If the bulls can propel the price above the moving averages, the pair could again attempt to rise above the resistance line of the triangle. If that happens, a move to the all-time high at $61,825 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance could resume the up-move.

Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will try to sink the price below the triangle. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $53,288 and then $44,752.

UNI/USD

Uniswap (UNI) is currently consolidating between $27.97 and $35.20. The bulls attempted to resume the uptrend on March 20 but the long wick on the candlestick and a close in the red suggests profit-booking near $35.20.

UNI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, there hasn’t been any follow-up selling today. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, which suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If the bulls can propel the price above $35.20, the UNI/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that could take it to $42.43 and then $46.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($30), the pair could drop to $27.97. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, traders may rush to the exit and that could result in a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($25.39) and then $22.

The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This suggests a balance between supply and demand.

If the price dips below the moving averages, a drop to $27.97 is possible. A bounce off this support could extend the stay of the pair inside the range.

The next trending move could start after the bulls push the price above $35.20 or the bears sink the pair below $27.97. Until then, the price may oscillate between the support and resistance levels of the range.

LUNA/USD

VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro turned positive as the signal for LUNA rose above 70 on March 18, indicating a positive outlook when the price was still undecided about the next move fr $18.17.

The VORTECS™ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.

The chart above shows the VORTECS™ score climbed steadily from 62 to 76 on March 18, well before the price picked up momentum on March 19.

Since then, the VORTECS™ score has remained bullish and has not fallen below 65. Meanwhile, LUNA continued to move up and reached $22.32 on March 21 in tandem with the VORTECS™ score, which hit 77.

LUNA is in a strong uptrend as it continues to make record highs on a daily basis. The bears attempted to stall the uptrend on March 17 but could not keep the price down for more than a day, which suggests strong buying on every minor dip.

LUNA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The long wick on the March 19 candlestick also shows profit-booking at higher levels, but the bulls again bought the dip and have pushed the price to a new all-time high today. This suggests the trend remains intact.

Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 84, indicating that bulls are in control. The next target objective on the upside is $27.46.

However, vertical rallies are rarely sustainable. Therefore, traders may wait for a correction or a consolidation to initiate fresh positions rather than chase the price higher. A break below $18.51 could result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($14.79).

A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment remains bullish as traders are buying the dips. But a break below the 20-day EMA could signal the start of a deeper correction.

The 4-hour chart shows the LUNA/USD pair is in a strong uptrend. The bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-EMA during the most recent leg of the uptrend, which is a positive sign.

Therefore, traders should keep a close eye on the 20-day EMA because a break below it will be the first sign that the momentum may be ebbing. The next support on the downside is the 50-SMA. A break below $17 could suggest that the bears have the upper hand.

THETA/USD

THETA has been in a strong uptrend for the past few days. The token rose to a new all-time high at $8.97 on March 19 but witnessed profit-booking at higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.

THETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the shallow correction on March 20 showed that traders were buying the dips and not rushing to the exit. During strong uptrends, the pullbacks are generally short-lived.

The bulls have again pushed the price to a new all-time high today, which shows the resumption of the uptrend. The THETA/USD pair could rally to $10.35 and then to $12.35. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the bulls are in command.

This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sell at higher levels and pull the price back below $7.99. If that happens, it will suggest the current breakout was a bull trap.

The 4-hour chart shows the price bounced off the breakout level at $7.999 and the bulls did not allow the pair to drop below the 20-EMA. The bears attempted to stall the up-move at the downtrend line but failed.

Strong buying by the bulls has pushed the price above the downtrend line and the $9 overhead resistance. This suggests the next leg of the uptrend may have begun.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will signal that the momentum has weakened. A break below the 50-SMA will suggest that the bears are attempting to make a comeback.

FIL/USD

Filecoin’s FIL token is in a strong uptrend. After its sharp rally on March 16 and 17, short-term traders seem to have booked profits, which has resulted in a minor correction on March 18. However, the shallow pullback is a positive sign as it shows that the majority of the traders are not rushing to the exit.

FIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls are attempting to keep the FIL/USD pair above $73.79, which is just below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $75.74. If the bulls succeed, the pair could again rise to $96.66.

A breakout and close above this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend, which could reach $128.55.

On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below $73.79, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($59.95). A strong rebound off this support will indicate that the trend remains positive but a break below it will suggest a short-term top may be in place.

The rebound off the $73.79 support indicates strong demand at lower levels. However, the bears are not relenting as they are aggressively defending the $86 level. If the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, the pair could again drop to $73.79. A break below this level will suggest advantage to the bears.

Alternatively, if the pair rebounds off $73.79, it may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The flattening 20-EMA and the gradually weakening RSI also point to a possible consolidation. A break above $86 could signal resumption of the uptrend.

In a report published Thursday, the firm highlighted the cryptocurrency's illiquidity as an obstacle.

DB also raised questions surrounding bitcoin's rising valuation and whether it is enough for the cryptocurrency to evolve into an asset class.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Deutsche Bank says it expects bitcoin to remain ""ultra-volatile"" due to its limited tradability, adding that just a few large purchases or market exits could significantly impact the cryptocurrency's supply-demand equilibrium.

In a recent report, the firm's research team pointed to the cryptocurrency's illiquidity - which features a set 21 million supply - as an obstacle. Thus far, around 18.7 million or 89% of bitcoins in total circulation have been mined. That expected year for all bitcoins to be mined is 2140, roughly a century from now

""As an investment asset, bitcoin liquidity remains low,"" the report said. ""In 2020, 28 million bitcoins changed hands (150% of total bitcoins in circulation), compared to 40 shares of Apple (270% of its total shares in circulation).""

The heart of the comparison between bitcoin - often referred to as digital gold - and gold boils down to the supply angle, in which both are limited, the report said. One major marginal driver of the price, therefore, becomes the demand.

DB also raised questions surrounding bitcoin's rising valuation and whether it is enough for the cryptocurrency to evolve into an asset class. But a turning point may be in the next two to three years, the group said, after more clarity about the cryptocurrency emerges.

""Bitcoin's market cap of $1 trillion makes it too important to ignore,"" the report said. ""Some people think bitcoin is a commodity. Others think it is a currency. A few think it is a stock. Nevertheless, its market cap is among the top 10, both as a currency and as a stock.""

Bitcoin has seen its price skyrocket 600% year-to-date amid divided opinion on whether it is in a speculative bubble waiting to burst or an asset that's here to stay. It has staged an epic run in March, hitting a $1 trillion market value yet again, and reaching a new peak above the $60,000-level, after an already-robust February.

As of Friday afternoon ET, bitcoin traded around to $58,700.

Deutsche Bank has published a report stating that bitcoin is too important to ignore, noting that it is now the third-largest currency in terms of the total value in circulation. In addition, the bank says that governments and central banks know that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and are expected to start regulating the industry this year.

Bitcoin Is Too Important to Ignore

Deutsche Bank Research published a report last week entitled: “Bitcoins: Can the Tinkerbell Effect Become a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy?” It is part three of “The Future of Payments: Series 2.” The report author, research analyst Marion Laboure, Ph.D., wrote:

Bitcoin’s market cap of $1 trillion makes it too important to ignore. As long as asset managers and companies continue to enter the market, bitcoin prices could continue to rise.

At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin stands at $57,455 and the cryptocurrency’s market cap is approximately $1.07 trillion based on data from markets.Bitcoin.com.

The report also discusses bitcoin as a commodity, currency, and equity. While noting that “bitcoin transactions and tradability are still limited,” the report states that the cryptocurrency’s “market cap is among the top ten, both as a currency and as a stock.” Comparing bitcoin to fiat currencies, the report details:

In terms of total currency in circulation, bitcoin is the third-largest in the world, after the US dollar and the euro.

“This is mainly due to the vast increase in bitcoin’s value recently,” the report continues, adding that “In early 2019, bitcoin represented ‘only’ 3% of the US dollars in circulation, but in February 2021 it surged beyond 40% of the US dollars in circulation.” The fourth-largest currency, according to Deutsche Bank Research, is the Japanese yen, followed by the Indian rupee.

Laboure asserted that “Bitcoin’s value will continue to rise and fall depending on what people believe it is worth.” She explained that “This is sometimes called the Tinkerbell Effect,” which is “a recognised economic term stating that the more people believe in something, the likelier it is to happen based on Peter Pan’s assertion that Tinkerbell exists because children believe she exists.”

Furthermore, the Deutsche Bank analyst opined:

Central banks and governments understand that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, so they are expected to start regulating crypto-assets late this year or early next year.

The Deutsche Bank report also notes that central banks “are also speeding up research on their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and launching pilots.”

Laboure proceeded to discuss the future of bitcoin. In the short term, she said, “bitcoin is here to stay and its value will remain volatile.”

In the medium to long run, the analyst believes that “due to very strong network effects, there will likely be little room for using cryptocurrencies as a widespread means of payment.” Moreover, she cautioned that in the long term, bitcoin “will have to transform potential into results to sustain its value proposition,” elaborating:

In the long run, central banks are unlikely to give up their monopolies. And as long as governments and central banks exist and hold the power to regulate money, there will be little room for bitcoin—as a means of payment—to replace traditional currencies.

On the other side of the debate, research by ARK Investment Management found the Bitcoin ecosystem consumes less than 10% of the energy required for the traditional banking system. While it’s true the banking system serves far more people, cryptocurrency is still maturing and, like any industry, the early infrastructure stage is particularly intensive.

The cryptocurrency mining industry, which garnered almost $1.4 billion in February 2021 alone, is not yet unusually terrible for the environment compared to other aspects of modern life in an industrialized society. Even de Vries told TechCrunch that if eco-conscious regulators “took all possible actions against Bitcoin, it’s unlikely you’d get all governments to go along with that” mining regulation.

“Ideally, change comes from within,” de Vries said, adding he hopes Bitcoin Core developers will alter the software to require less computational energy. “I think Bitcoin consumes half as much energy as all the world’s data centers at the moment.”

According to the University of Cambridge’s bitcoin electricity consumption index, bitcoin miners are expected to consume roughly 130 Terawatt-hours of energy (TWh), which is roughly 0.6% of global electricity consumption. This puts the bitcoin economy on par with the carbon dioxide emissions of a small, developing nation like Sri Lanka or Jordan. Jordan, in particular, is home to 10 million people. It’s impossible to say how many people use bitcoin every month, and they certainly use it less often than residents in Amman use Jordanian dinars. But CoinMetrics data indicates more than 1 million bitcoin addresses are active, daily, out of up to 106 million accounts active in the past decade, as tallied by the exchange Crypto.com.

“We get the total population of unique bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) users by counting the total number of addresses from listed exchanges, subtracting addresses owned by the same users on multiple exchanges,” said a Crypto.com spokesperson. “We then further reduce this number by accounting for users who own both ETH and BTC.”

That’s a lot of people using these financial networks. Plus, many bitcoin mining businesses rely on environmentally friendly energy sources like hydropower and capturing natural gas leaks from oil fields. A mining industry veteran, Compass Mining COO Thomas Heller, said Chinese hydropower mines in Sichuan and Yunnan get cheaper electricity during the wet season. They continue to use hydropower all year, he added, although it’s less profitable during the annual dry season.

“The electricity price outside of May to October [wet season] is much more expensive,” Heller said. “However, some farms do have water supply in other parts of the year.”

The best way to make cryptocurrency mining more eco-friendly is to support lawmakers that want to encourage mining in regions that already have underutilized energy sources.

Basically, cryptocurrency mining doesn’t inherently produce extra carbon emissions because computers can use power from any source. In 2019, the digital asset investing firm CoinShares released a study estimating up to 73% of bitcoin miners use at least some renewable energy as part of their power supply, including hydropower from China’s massive dams. All of the top five bitcoin mining pools, consortiums for miners to cooperate for better profit margins, rely heavily on hydropower. This statistic doesn’t impress de Vries, who pointed out that Cambridge researchers found renewable energy makes up 39% of miners’ total energy consumption.

“I put one solar panel on my power plant, I also have a mixture of renewable energy,” de Vries said.

In terms of geographic distribution, Cambridge data indicates Chinese bitcoin mining operations represent around 65% of the network’s power, called hashrate. In some regions, like China’s Xinjiang province, bitcoin miners also burn coal for electricity. Beyond cryptocurrency mining, this province is known for human rights abuses against the Uighur population, which China is violently suppressing as part of a broader struggle to capitalize on the region’s natural resources. When critics sound the alarm about cryptocurrency mining and energy consumption, this is often the dynamic they’re concerned about.

On the other hand, North American miners make up roughly 8% of the global hashrate, followed closely by miners in Russia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called for the creation of a national bitcoin mining strategy in 2020, aiming to grow the Islamic nation’s influence over this financial system despite banking sanctions imposed by the United States.

Wherever nations and organizations offer the most profitable mining regulations, those are the places where bitcoin mining will proliferate. Chinese dominance, to date, can be at least partially attributed to government subsidies for the mining industry. As such, nations like China and Norway offer subsidies that incentivize bitcoin miners to use local hydropower sources.

As the Seetee research report by Aker ASA, a $6 billion public company based in Norway, said: “The financiers of min­ing op­er­a­tions will in­sist on us­ing the cheap­est en­er­gy and so by de­f­i­n­i­tion it will be elec­tric­i­ty that has no bet­ter eco­nom­ic use.”

The best way to make cryptocurrency mining more eco-friendly is to support lawmakers that want to encourage mining in regions that already have underutilized energy sources.

When it comes to North America, Blockstream CEO Adam Back says his company’s mining facilities, with 300 megawatts in mining capacity, rely on a mix of industrial power sources like hydropower. He added Blockstream is exploring solar-powered bitcoin mining options as a sort of “retirement home” for outdated machines.

“With solar energy, if you’re only online 50% of the time, that’s something to consider in terms of the cost analysis,” Back said. “That’s a better option for older machines, after you’ve already recouped the costs of the equipment.”

Due to surging cryptocurrency prices, there’s now a global shortage of bitcoin mining equipment, Back added, with demand outpacing supply and production taking up to six months per machine. Emma Todd, founder of the consultancy MMH Blockchain Group, said the shortage is driving up the price of mining machines.

“For example, a Bitmain Antminer S9 mining machine that used to cost $35 – $55 in July 2020 on the secondary market, now costs about $275 – $300,” Todd said. “This means that most, if not all mining companies looking to purchase new or secondary equipment, are all experiencing the same challenges. As a result of the global chip shortage, most new mining equipment that is scheduled to come out in the next few months, will almost certainly be delayed.”

Critics like de Vries point out that, due to market forces, industrial miners are unlikely to reduce their power consumption with new machines, which are more efficient.

“If you have more efficient machines but earn the same money, then people just run two machines instead of one,” de Vries said.

And yet, because cryptocurrency prices are rising faster than new miners can be constructed, Back said “retiring” old machines with renewable energy sources becomes more profitable than simply abandoning them for new equipment. In addition, Back said, robust bitcoin mining infrastructure can support communities rather than draining resources. This is because bitcoin miners can help store and arbitrage energy flows.

“You can turn miners on and off if you get to a surge prices situation, you can use the power for people to heat their homes if that’s more urgent or more profitable,” Back said. “Bitcoin could actually support power grids.”

Meanwhile, just north of the Canadian border, Upstream Data president Steve Barbour said a growing number of traditional oil and gas companies are quietly ramping up their own bitcoin mining operations.

This puts the bitcoin economy on par with the carbon dioxide emissions of a small, developing nation like Sri Lanka or Jordan.

“Right now it’s hydro and coal. That’s the majority of the big industrial mining. But on the global scale, that’s going to shift more toward any cheap power, including natural gas,” Barbour said. “Oil fields already have cheap energy with the venting flares, the waste gas, there’s potential for approximately 160 gigawatts [of mining power] this year.”

Upstream Data helps oil companies set up and operate bitcoin miners in a way that captures waste and low quality gas, which they couldn’t sell before, totaling 100 deployments across North America. These companies rarely go public with their bitcoin mining operations, Barbour said, because they’re concerned about attracting negative press from Bitcoin critics.

“They are definitely concerned about reputational risk, but I think that’s going to change soon because you have big, credible companies like Tesla involved with Bitcoin,” Barbour said.

Even within the cryptocurrency industry, there are many people who dislike how power-intensive bitcoin mining is and are experimenting with different mining methods. For example, the Ethereum community is trying to switch to a “proof-of-stake” (PoS) mining model, powering the network with locked up coins instead of Bitcoin’s intensive “proof-of-work” (PoW) model.

As the name might suggest, PoW requires a lot of computational “work.” That’s what miners do, lots and lots of math problems that are so difficult the computers require a lot of electricity. With regards to Ethereum, which currently runs on PoW but will theoretically run on PoS in a few years, there are hundreds of thousands of daily active addresses, sometimes half as many as Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin, a few industrial mining projects with facilities in China generate more than half of the Ethereum network’s power. Each Ethereum transaction requires nearly as much energy as two American households use per day.

“What I like about the Ethereum community is at least they are thinking about how to solve the problem,” de Vries said. “What I don’t like is they’ve been talking about it for a few years and haven’t been able to actually do it.”

The Ethereum ecosystem uses enough energy every year to power the nation of Panama. Like Bitcoin, each Ethereum transaction costs enough for electricity costs that the money could also buy a nice lunch. Both of these networks require enough power to fuel small countries, although Ethereum usually has less than half of the million daily users that Bitcoin has. It’s clear cryptocurrency transactions require more power than Visa transactions. However, a cryptocurrency isn’t just a payments company. It is a whole currency system.

If the bitcoin market cap were ranked as a country, by the value of the money supply, Bitcoin would come in fifth place behind Japan. And that’s not even considering adjacent ecosystems like Ethereum. In short, power consumption in the global Bitcoin economy is comparable to that of some other industrialized financial systems. It is inefficient, as de Vries points out, as are many of the systems used in emerging economies. Out of millions of users, thousands of people around the world rely on cryptocurrency for income. They are generally optimistic about the cryptocurrency ecosystem, believing it will become more efficient as the technology matures.

“I see Bitcoin mining increasingly playing a role in the transition to a clean, modern and more decentralized energy system,” said one such Canadian business consultant, Magdalena Gronowska. “Miners can provide grid balancing and flexible demand-response services and improve renewables integration.”","There are over 1600 cryptocurrencies available in the market today. Among all the others Ethereum and Bitcoin hold their position in the top 3s. On the other hand, many experts have also predicted that Ethereum might topple Bitcoin anytime soon, and it’s all because of Ethereum’s aggressive growth. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are cryptocurrencies, but pretty different from each other. They not only have different features, but their benefits are also different. But both of them stand out as the best platforms for trading and investing. To know more about them you can click on this go URL and learn more about them.

Ethereum vs Bitcoin: The definition

To have a clear understanding of the two most popular cryptocurrencies in the market, you can check out the information about them below.

Bitcoin:

Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, which was established in 2009. It has the power to send and receive money across the globe. All the payments are secured with the help of cryptography. The best thing about Bitcoin is that it keeps the identification of the users incognito who are receiving and sending money. When compared with other payment methods, the transaction fee of Bitcoin is pretty low. Bitcoin will not charge you more or less but only the given rate no matter how big the transaction amount is. Thanks to blockchain technology, all the sending and receiving of payments are safe and secure. Along with that, the transaction process will also be pretty fast.

Ethereum:

Ethereum is also a cryptocurrency, which was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015. This cryptocurrency provides Ether tokens, which are equivalent to the Bitcoins within the Bitcoin network. Ether gets utilized to deploy and create decentralized applications, and their back-end code gets placed within the distributed peer-to-peer network. This is pretty different from a regular application because the back-end code gets placed within a centralized server. Ether is also used for paying services, such as paying transaction fees. It is also used for paying computational power, which is needed before a block gets added to the blockchain.

The difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin

The debate of Bitcoin vs Ethereum has become popular and is also gaining plenty of hype for the past several years. Bitcoin holds the position as the well-known cryptocurrency across the globe. It carries the highest market cap among all the other cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, Ethereum is also pretty popular, but it did not receive revolutionary effects like Bitcoin. But the inventor of Ethereum learned through Bitcoin and created more functionalities, which are based completely on the concepts of Bitcoin. Moreover, Ethereum stands out as the 2nd most valuable cryptocurrency in today’s market.

Ethereum vs Bitcoin: The concept

Bitcoin has the power to enable peer-to-peer transactions and acts as a replacement for fiat currencies and does not possess any issues like fiat currencies. There is no need for you to pay high transaction fees, and you do not have a centralized authority that helps in regulating how exactly Bitcoin’s work. Ethereum does provide peer-to-peer transactions but also offers a platform for creating smart applications and contracts. A small contract will allow you to exchange anything of value, such as real estate, shares, money, and many more.

Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Who’s the winner?

To determine the winner between Ethereum and Bitcoin will depend heavily on your needs. The cryptocurrency you choose for your investing or trading work will make it the ultimate winner.","Bitcoins and Bitcoin Mining are two terms that are sometimes used interchangeably. Bitcoin mining is the procedure that helps Bitcoin to serve as a distributed transaction record. Without going through needless technical information, Bitcoin works by using voluntary processing resources to build a public ledger with all bitcoin possession at a given point in time. Bitcoin miners who “solve” this mechanism at any given moment are rewarded with a transaction fee as well as the freshly minted bitcoins which this process generates. Bitcoin world introduced a new community app through which you can easily connect with other people visit here: www.weedprofitsystemapp.com.

The mining method for Bitcoin was planned from the start to produce a diminishing and eventually restricted amount of final Bitcoins. Every Bitcoin incentive for mining is reduced as time goes by before the total number of mined Bitcoins exceeds 21 million. Bitcoin miners would only be paid the trading costs at this stage, and no further Bitcoins would be rewarded for the process of mining.

Bitcoin Rewarding Bitcoin:

The end of Bitcoin mining incentives does not imply the end of the mining project, which leaves Bitcoin running as a medium of exchange and a store of wealth. The whole Bitcoin infrastructure would crash if this process did not take place.

Bitcoin’s Value In The Future:

Though little has been assured, it is widely assumed that the price of Bitcoin will begin to rise as further transactions are processed through that same 21 million Bitcoins. The more customers choose to use that type of currency to conduct purchases, the more valuable the currency becomes. If you can can’t mine enough Bitcoins to keep up with the rising demand for them, their value about all other commodities had to rise as well.

Bitcoin Mining’s Future Prospects:

What relates to Bitcoin mining, on the other hand, is even more intriguing. Bitcoin mining is a booming industry right now. Large specialized farms do most of Bitcoin mining in China, where the required power input is inexpensive. Why will people want to fund the Bitcoin scheme if they are no longer paid with Bitcoins for doing the mining that keeps the service going?

Although there is much debate in the Bitcoin world about modifying the new regulations for Bitcoin, if it improves, the mining payout would have to come entirely through transaction fees. The transaction costs for Bitcoin mining are currently insignificant compared to the size of the Bitcoin rewards, but either the dividend payments must rise in value, or the expense of conducting Bitcoin mining must decrease, most certainly through advancements in the blockchain infrastructure that underpins a Bitcoin framework.

Bitcoin’s Spectacular Future:

Nobody knows where Bitcoin can go in the future. There are heated discussions on how Bitcoin can evolve after the full number of participants has also been reached and whether the initial rules can be updated. If you’re thinking of investing in Bitcoin, keep an eye on these controversies because the results would significantly impact the growth of Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

When you glance at the Gartner hype cycle for 2014, you will see that we were simply at the “High point of Unrealistic Expectations,” so we went straight into the “Reservoir of Disillusionment.” Now the market as a whole is working its way back to competitiveness. A significant amount of investment capital has been spent in some very impressive Bitcoin-focused ventures led by fantastic investors. This money is being invested right now, and a whole system is being developed, which takes time. The market goes from here depends on these developers and businesses, ensuring that they use this incredible technology to address real-world problems that real citizens and businesses face.

Category: Local News, NEWS","Bitcoin has been much of the market to new all-time highs as institutional investors pile into digital finance, but it could be the arrival of Coinbase, a leading crypto exchange, on Wall Street that may make a significant impact.

Bitcoin may be the most dominant player in the world of cryptocurrencies, but Coinbase has grown into a market leader in terms of platforms in which investors can buy and sell coins. Shares in the company reportedly traded for between $350 and $375 based on a recent private Nasdaq auction, amounting to a pre-IPO company valuation of up to $100 billion.

As we can see from the chart above, Coinbase’s monthly transacting users (MTUs) have risen to a level that hasn’t been seen since the end of the 2017 crypto bull run. The timing of Coinbase’s arrival on the New York Stock Exchange could hardly come at a better time as Bitcoin has entered 2021 in a state of price discovery as new all-time highs are repeatedly broken for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency and various altcoins.

While such growth has certainly helped the Coinbase push to go public, it’s worth asking what the impact of a cryptocurrency being floated on Wall Street will mean for a cryptocurrency ecosystem that still exists away from mainstream acceptance and widespread adoption?

Building on The Coinbase Bounce

Because of Coinbase’s stature in the crypto market, cryptocurrencies have become known to experience a boost in price in the immediate aftermath of becoming listed on the exchange. This phenomenon has become known as ‘the Coinbase effect’ and it has the potential to generate significant levels of trading volume for coins as huge volumes of investors become exposed to the new coins for the first time.

As Coinbase opts for a direct listing on the NYSE, we may see a different kind of effect altogether on the crypto market. The furore surrounding Coinbase going public may well bring optimism to the world of cryptocurrencies as its biggest exchange intertwines with the world of stocks and shares.

As the ecosystem’s primary exchange, a successful launch for Coinbase could carry a significant impact on the prices of assets like Bitcoin and various altcoins. In a market that’s often struggled for acceptance among retail investors, a cryptocurrency exchange going public could bring a further layer of validation on top of the significant institutional investments from the likes of Tesla and MicroStrategy.

Coinbase going public may be a leading influence in terms of cryptocurrency adoption within an industry that some investors have found too mysterious or volatile to buy into. With this in mind, Coinbase’s successful listing could further break down barriers between retail investors and the wider world of crypto.

It’s worth noting that the influence of Coinbase’s listing could work both ways. If the cryptocurrency exchange fails to inspire investors in a meaningful way, the falling price of the exchange could drag a cryptocurrency market that’s already suffered from some levels of volatility over February and March down significantly.

The cryptocurrency market has often used Coinbase as a great springboard for generating larger market caps and reaching higher asset values. Now, with the leading exchange set to go public, the entire landscape will be hoping that Coinbase can leverage an almighty boost for the entire market.

What Impact Will a Direct Listing Have?

Although many had anticipated Coinbase going public with a formal initial public offering, the exchange chose the option of a direct listing rather than an IPO.

The reason behind this could have involved the fact that companies that offer IPOs traditionally create brand new shares for investors to buy. Though the SEC lifted these restrictions, Coinbase opted to go public without creating new shares and diluting its existing equity. This form of listing will also mean that Coinbase can sidestep the costly requirements of utilizing underwriters to launch its IPO.

The move could be seen as a welcome one for investors. This is because Coinbase’s direct listing looks set to enable anybody to buy and trade shares at the same time in the company. This has the potential to open the door to retail investors who are curious about the world in which the exchange operates.

Although IPOs have the power to create a buzz surrounding a company set to go public, the world of initial public offerings are typically more exclusive and restricted more to institutional investors who have the power to buy large volumes of shares in one transaction, as opposed to retail traders who would likely only buy single shares at a time.

Despite IPOs generally being restrictive to typical retail investors, there are a number of platforms that allow the general public to take part, including the Nasdaq-listed Freedom Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: FRHC) enables retail investors to participate in IPOs, however, in order to take part a threshold of $2,000 is required and there’s an application process attached, too.

There are also more traditional brokerages that offer participation in IPOs. One such company is Fidelity, where investors can buy into initial offerings provided they have between $100,000 and $500,000 in household assets, while TD Ameritrade also offers this service to anyone as long as they have an account value of over $250,000.

Although retail traders can access initial public offerings, Coinbase’s choice of a direct listing has ensured that, just like with its exchange, the company is open to everyone – regardless of whether they’re institutional investors or members of the general public. Furthermore, this is likely to come across as appealing to the cryptocurrency purists, who revel in the decentralized level playing field that the market stands for.

In choosing a direct listing, Coinbase is looking to uphold the values that the crypto marketplace is built on. If its approach can open the door for new widespread investment in the industry, then the company’s approach may be fully vindicated.

During a hearing in the SEC’s case against Ripple in which the regulatory agency accuses the digital payments firm of illegally selling unauthorized securities in the form of XRP, legal counsel Jorge Tenreiro argues that XRP is dissimilar to the two large-cap crypto assets which have already been cleared by the SEC.

U.Today reports that within his case against Ripple, Tenreiro notes that XRP, unlike BTC and ETH, is backed by a knowable and singular body.

“Mr. Solomon (Ripple’s general counsel) tries to say that ‘we are no different than Bitcoin and Ether.’ As Ripple’s own lawyers told them, you are not like Bitcoin because you are one entity that has created these assets. That is fundamentally different.”

The lawyer also asserts that even though the company has attempted to find a use case for its XRP token, the firm has been unable to demonstrate that its token has any utility.

“We dispute whether this utility actually exists, your honor. But the point is: even if it did exist, Ripple and the defendants’ efforts to develop a use for XRP is what makes XRP a security.”

Judge Sarah Netburn, the presiding official in the case, attempts to clarify the difference between XRP and the first and second-largest crypto assets.

“My understanding of XRP is that not only does it have a currency value but it also has a utility and that utility distinguishes it from Bitcoin and Ether.”

Ripple’s general counsel replies that, while XRP’s utility is different from that of ETH and BTC, it does in fact have a use case.

“Bitcoin and Ether also have utility… Bitcoin does have use cases that it has developed. So does Ether. They have smart contracts for example that can be done over the Ethereum blockchain. XRP also has developed a number of use cases and these started very early in the process which is why its so baffling that the SEC has charged this long-running scheme from 2013 to the present because XRP for example has a product called On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) that is used to assist financial institutions in having seamless and less costly transactions in key corridors…

XRP as a digital asset is helpful because it means that banks don’t have to have their own fiat accounts on either end and can deploy that money more effectively elsewhere and XRP can be used as a bridge currency and Mr. Garlinghouse (Ripple CEO) has been brought to Ripple to help develop these additional use cases.”

Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) ascent to record highs came to a halt on Sunday as the cryptocurrency's price fell more than 6% to $56,306 (£40,596). It made several attempts to soar past the all-time high price, peaking at $59,400 on Saturday.

It comes after, the cryptocurrency climbed more than 5% last week to a high of $60,322.60, according to Coindesk, continuing a stellar rally this year. The move passed the previous all-time record of around $58,330 set on 21 February.

So far, Bitcoin has surged more than 65% last month alone, and over 100% this year.

In late February, it saw a retreat to as low as $43,000 amid uncertainty in the traditional markets over stimulus expectations and their positive effects on US bond yields.

Analysts have said that they expect ""higher volatility in the stock market"" in the coming weeks after US president Joe Biden signed a long-awaited $1.9trn COVID relief package, which gives individual American's their third stimulus checks worth $1,400. This is expected to bolstered optimism in financial markets.

The market value of all bitcoin in circulation hit $1tn for the first time last month, data website CoinMarketCap revealed.

The cryptocurrency has been fuelled of late by acceptance from mainstream investors and companies, such as Tesla (TSLA) and Mastercard (MA).

Tesla invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, in February, and said it may even start accepting it as payment for its products.

In December, it soared past Visa (V) making it the world’s largest financial service.

Bitcoin started 2020 at about $7,000 per coin. Despite its rise in the last year, the cryptocurrency remains extremely volatile and experts continue to remain sceptical about using it as an investment.

According to industry data, about 13% of all bitcoin in the world, some $80bn out of $600bn, belongs to just over 100 individual accounts, the Telegraph reported. The top 40% of all bitcoin, roughly $240bn, is held by just under 2,500 known accounts out of roughly 100 million overall.

Story continues

Bitcoin started 2020 at around $7,000 per coin. Despite its rise in the last year, the cryptocurrency remains extremely volatile and experts continue to remain sceptical about using it as an investment.

However, a survey published last month showed almost two-thirds of UK investors intend to buy bitcoin in 2021.

According to a Trading Platforms report, the number of Bitcoin ATMs around the world increased by 70% in the last six months, hitting 16,500 in March. A bitcoin ATM is a kiosk that allows a person to purchase bitcoin by using cash or debit card. Some offer both the purchase of bitcoin as well as the sale of bitcoin for cash.

WATCH: What is bitcoin?"
2021-03-22,"The two leading crypto assets are currently stalled at major resistance levels and seem unable to break through. Bitcoin itself reached $60k per coin twice in the last week, only to quickly correct both times

Fundamental analysis: Great expectations

Bitcoin has been a topic of a lot of positive predictions over the past few weeks, and less than seven days ago, a report by Deutsche Bank openly claimed that Bitcoin was too important to ignore. However, just a few days later, the bank also noted that BTC will remain ‘ultra-volatile’ due to its limited tradability, noting that its illiquidity is an obstacle to greater adoption.

The bank’s report recognised that Bitcoin is now the 3rd-largest currency in the world, with a market cap of around $1.07 trillion. Another big development regarding the coin includes the new Bitcoin IRA program, which is a digital IRA that allows users to buy, sell, or swap cryptos for their retirement accounts. According to a recent press release, the program has seen more than $100 million invested into it, meaning that interest in BTC is continuing to skyrocket.

With interest growing, the popular brokerage app, Robinhood, decided to boost its crypto team and make a huge investment into the field, as its CEO, Vlad Tenev, said in a recent video Q&A.

Another prediction came from CoinGecko’s COO, Bobby Ong. He noted that the coin has the potential to hit $100,000 per coin in 2021, although he also warned that there are dangers ahead, and that BTC risks loom on the horizon.

Lastly, it is also worth noting that the Atlanta-based BTC ATM provider launched more than 100 new machines across the US, installing them in over 24 states. This is one of the biggest indicators that the crypto industry is, indeed, seeing greater levels of adoption across the US. Bitcoin ATMs have yet to be officially regulated, and as such, they only appear where there is a perceived demand.

Ethereum has seen a lot fewer mentions, as most of the community currently focuses on its different segments, instead of the project, in general. Its DeFi sector, of course, continues to thrive. In the meantime, the NFT craze has also been taking over the industry.

However, the few mentions of Ethereum were mostly positive. One example is a hint from a Messari analyst, Ryan Watkins, who said that Ethereum could overtake BTC once Ethereum 2.0 rolls out in full.

His logic is that Bitcoin is currently considered safer and that its monetary policy is highly predictable. Ethereum could end up dominating regarding both these things once ETH 2.0 launches, and so Ethereum might simply pick up BTC users who want the same benefits on a better blockchain.

Finally, a survey for US residents by Mizuho Securities revealed that over 10% of the 235 participants plan to use their incoming stimulus checks for buying BTC. If this sample is true, then more people are looking to invest into BTC than in stocks. This could end up bringing 430% to the coin, but that Ethereum could still outperform it, simply due to the benefits and interest that ETH 2.0 will bring.

Bitcoin and Ethereum held down by the resistances

According to CEX.IO data, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have run into strong resistances over the past few weeks, and can’t seem to break them. For Bitcoin, this immovable obstacle seems to be the $60k mark, which BTC reached twice over the past seven days, only to be rejected both times.

The first rejection came on 18th March, when the coin actually managed to reach $60,300, only to crash to $57k. After reaching the level again on 20th March, it was rejected even more strongly, to $55,550. Bitcoin has recovered slightly since then, currently sitting at $58,670.

As for Ethereum, it saw a similar journey, only its major resistance level is currently set at $1,850. The coin has been trying to breach this level for weeks, and over the past week or so managed to reach it twice. The first time, it was a result of a surge from $1,744 to $1,835, but the coin got rejected to $1,735.

The second one was a result of a somewhat slower climb between early March 19th and late March 20th, resulting in the coin hitting $1866, only to be strongly rejected to $1,750.

With the end of the Q1 now being only a little more than a week away, it would seem that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will indeed outperform my past prediction. We expected BTC to hit $50k by the end of March, but the coin is already $10,000 higher than that.

Our next prediction is that it will reach $80k by the end of Q2, which would mean that it has to go $20k higher than where it is right now over the next few months.

As for Ethereum, we expect it to reach the end of the second quarter at $2,200, since it will clearly outperform our forecast for the end of Q1 thanks to its correlation with Bitcoin.","This article is the first in a two-part series on cryptocurrency and climate change.

Are you thinking of investing in Bitcoin? The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged in value since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by furloughed millennials and high-profile investors like Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla. The car manufacturer revealed in February that it had invested USD 1.5 billion in Bitcoin.

With investments rocketing five-fold since October, many are wondering, “How do I get into Bitcoin?” But, given that climate change is forecasted to reduce average global incomes roughly 23 percent by 2100, we should be asking a more fundamental question: “What impact do cryptocurrencies have on the environment?”

In this first article of our two-part series on cryptocurrency and climate change, Landscape News went to the experts and put Bitcoin under the microscope.

How bad is Bitcoin for the environment?

Short answer: terrible and getting worse

In How Bad Are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything, professor Berners-Lee describes cryptocurrencies as “one of the most fundamentally pointless ways of using energy.” It’s a forthright statement, but the data would seem to support Berners-Lee.

A 2019 study from two sustainability researchers at Aalborg University, Susanne Köhler and Massimo Pizzol, estimated that the Bitcoin mining network in 2018 had an annual footprint of 17.29 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. That is roughly the same as driving from San Francisco to New York 15,000 times, or the amount of carbon hypothetically sequestered by a forest the size of Portugal.

But Köhler and Pizzol were using data from 2018, when the market value of Bitcoin was a seventh of its value today. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Bitcoin currently uses more electricity than the entire countries of Austria and Greece combined. Since the most recent surge in market price, which began in November 2020, the energy demands of the Bitcoin network have doubled.

In order to understand why this has happened, we must first understand how cryptocurrencies work.

Why does Bitcoin use so much electricity?

Short answer: because “proof of work” blockchains demand huge computer power

Fundamentally, currencies only have value because a group of people believe that they have value. The only reason that we can exchange goods and services with the tap of a credit card is because everybody trusts the system. As anthropologist David Graeber wrote in Debt: The First 5,000 Years, “the value of a unit of currency is not the measure of the value of an object, but the measure of one’s trust in other human beings.”

With conventional currencies, that trust is backed up by a national or federal central bank, the government, the police and, ultimately, the military. As a result, most people have a lot of faith in the system and, most of the time, the system works. Bitcoin, in contrast, is backed by absolutely nothing: no central bank, no government and certainly no military. So why do so many people trust it?

The answer is blockchain technology, invented in 2008 by a still-anonymous creator called Satoshi Nakamoto. In cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the blockchain serves as a “distributed ledger,” a public record of transactions that is virtually impossible to defraud. Over the years, the Bitcoin blockchain has proved itself trustworthy again and again: to the point where a company like Tesla has trusted the cryptocurrency more than the US dollar for its latest investment.

The problem for the environment is that the Bitcoin blockchain is founded on something called “proof of work.” In proof of work blockchains, computers around the world (called “miners”) compete to add new blocks of currency transactions to the ledger by solving extremely hard mathematical puzzles. The first computers to solve these puzzles are rewarded in Bitcoin. The difficulty of these puzzles also helps keep financial transactions in the blockchain secure: it is simply too expensive to defraud the network.

The problem for the environment is that the Bitcoin blockchain is founded on something called “proof of work.”

The issue is that Bitcoin is designed to be scarce, like gold. Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that one block would be added to the blockchain roughly every 10 minutes. This 10-minute rule is regulated by the difficulty of the mathematical puzzles and, as computing power has increased since 2008, the difficulty of the mining puzzles has also increased exponentially.

In January 2009, the difficulty of the puzzles was 1.0. In March 2021, the difficulty of the puzzles is 20 trillion. Because the puzzles are harder, the mining computers need to work harder, using more and more electricity. In 2018, Bitcoin miners in Kosovo drained enough power from the grid to make digital clocks all over Europe lose time.

Unfortunately, as more and more investors pile in, the price of Bitcoin is rising faster than the electricity bills of the mining companies.

Is there any way of using Bitcoin without having a negative impact on the environment?

Short answer: no

“I don’t think you can participate [in Bitcoin] and have zero impact,” says Susanne Köhler, a sustainable blockchain researcher at Aalborg University. “Firstly, one could attribute to your transactions the related share of the system’s impacts. Secondly, using Bitcoin adds to the miners’ revenues and likely impacts the market price, so you are perpetuating a system that has a negative impact, whether that’s you buying USD .05 Bitcoin or Elon Musk buying 1.5 billion.”

You don’t have to search hard to find arguments defending the vast energy use of Bitcoin, many of them extremely convincing, but the resounding message from researchers looking at its environmental impacts is to beware the true believers. “Having these conversations can be extremely frustrating because there are so many people that believe in Bitcoin and don’t want to look at the negative sides,” says Köhler.

Next we’ll examine some of the arguments that Bitcoin believers use to defend the cryptocurrency’s high energy cost.

What if Bitcoin only used renewable energy?

Using survey data from May 2020, Cambridge University’s 3rd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study found that 39 percent of global proof of work mining was powered by renewable energy. For miners based in Europe and North America, that proportion goes up to 70 percent and 66 percent respectively.

“There are some Bitcoin mining operations that are projected to positively impact the world of renewable energy, but on a large scale, that is likely not the case,” Köhler says.

Because of low energy prices, including from renewables, around half the world’s Bitcoin mining takes place in China. However, the enormous environmental cost is already putting the industry on a collision course with President Xi Jinping’s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, and the Chinese government recently announced that all Bitcoin mining operations in Inner Mongolia will be shut down by the end of April because they were preventing the region from meeting its carbon reduction goals.

Ultimately, the question of whether the power used to mine Bitcoin is environmentally-friendly or not is somewhat irrelevant. Renewables only supply 28 percent of the world’s electricity, so the Bitcoin network’s use of green energy simply means that other areas of the economy cannot decarbonize.

“There have been multiple cases where Bitcoin mining facilities have displaced other electricity consumption,” Köhler says. “So, if they use the renewable electricity, others may not have access to [renewables] anymore.”

What if Bitcoin only used “stranded” or “curtailed” energy?

Some Bitcoin mining sites around the world are powered by “stranded” or “curtailed” energy – energy that, for whatever reason, cannot be connected to the grid and would otherwise be wasted.

This argument has been used to defend Bitcoin mining in places like Sichuan, China, where, during the rainy season, hydroelectric dams generate a huge excess of power. By only using curtailed power, Bitcoin is in effect preserving surplus energy in the same way that Iceland captures its surplus renewable power by smelting aluminum.

But, according to Köhler, this defense is no longer valid. “We’re not at the scale where that is possible any longer,” she says. “The Bitcoin network is increasing and cannot be covered by curtailed power alone.”

There are two further arguments against the idea of using curtailed electricity, even if it were able to cover the energy demands of Bitcoin. Firstly, as Köhler says, it “disincentivizes power plants from being integrated into international grids” and, secondly, it also disincentivizes research and development into grid-scale batteries that could store and transport the energy off-site.

In the grand scheme of planetary challenges, just how bad is Bitcoin?

Christian Stoll, co-author of another paper that estimates the carbon footprint of Bitcoin, points out that Bitcoin is currently responsible for less than 1 percent of global carbon emissions. Although Stoll agrees that proof of work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are “not climate conscious investments,” he also suggests that “there are bigger levers to meet the Paris Agreement goals”.

For comparison, the entire Bitcoin network currently uses about half as much power every year as all the electronic devices that citizens of the U.S. leave plugged in when they are not using them.

The entire Bitcoin network currently uses about half as much power every year as all the electronic devices that citizens of the U.S. leave plugged in when they are not using them.

Nevertheless, because the mathematical puzzles underpinning the cryptocurrency are getting harder and harder to solve, there is no doubt that Bitcoin is environmentally harmful and getting worse, despite a 96 percent increase in mining machine efficiency over the past seven years. That puts a hole in the argument that Bitcoin mining technology might somehow reduce its impact through efficiency gains.

If proof of work is the problem, the question is: are there any greener alternatives? Finally, here’s some good news.

Is there a greener alternative to Bitcoin and “proof of work”?

Short answer: yes, but the problem is convincing everyone to switch

Stephen Reid, selected as the Green Party candidate for Totnes, U.K. at the last General Election, is one of the teachers of Tools for the Regenerative Renaissance, a course that combines technology and blockchain education with climate consciousness.

“Bitcoin was the very earliest instantiation of this technology, and it is incredibly energy inefficient,” says Reid, who holds a master’s degree in physics and another in complexity sciences. “But, nevertheless, it was a stroke of absolute genius. It is changing the world as much as Einstein’s 1905 papers on quantum mechanics and special relativity.”

“Satoshi Nakamoto pieced together three or four different concepts to produce the first decentralized form of money, in a way that no one had thought before. Bitcoin is incredibly energy inefficient and cannot be defended over the long term, but, happily, people have come up with vastly more energy efficient consensus schemes.”

The most promising alternative to proof of work is called proof of stake. In proof of stake blockchains, the blocks are “forged” rather than “mined” and, instead of solving hard puzzles, the creator of the next block in the chain is chosen using a combination of randomization and how much of the cryptocurrency they hold – that’s the stake.

Don’t worry. You don’t necessarily have to understand the finer details to get the point that proof of stake is better for the environment than proof of work. If you do want to learn more, Coindesk has a great explainer.

What is the environmental impact of proof of stake blockchains?

Proof of work blockchains are designed to need computers running all day, every day. Proof of stake blockchains only need computers to run for milliseconds at a time. Because it doesn’t require hard computing work, proof of stake has the potential to massively reduce the energy needed to add blocks to a cryptocurrency’s blockchain.

“Not using proof of work would reduce the calculated footprint to zero and the overall footprint by approximately 99 percent,” Köhler says.

It is worth emphasizing that the overall energy use of a proof of stake cryptocurrency is not zero: it still needs a peer-to-peer computer network to verify transactions and secure the system. “The numbers that we calculated are 100 percent the mining process,” Köhler explains. “They don’t include the servers that host the blockchain nodes.”

Nevertheless, proof of stake still represents a huge improvement in energy efficiency over proof of work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. There are already proof of stake cryptocurrencies out in the world: Avalanche, Cardano and Harmony to name three of the largest – but they are all small fry compared to Bitcoin. However, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum, is midway through a complicated transition from proof of work to proof of stake.

According to Ethereum’s website, the transition to proof of stake has three phases, the first of which is already live and the third due sometime in 2022. “Everybody’s been waiting for Ethereum’s move to proof of stake for years, but it’s a slow, step-by-step process,” says Köhler.

The good news is that, should it be successful, the carbon-saving benefits of the transition will not only effect those who hold the Ethereum cryptocurrency. “Ethereum is fundamentally different to Bitcoin,” Köhler explains. “It is a cryptocurrency, but it also hosts tons and tons of applications.”

Whereas Bitcoin aims to become the world currency, Ethereum aims to become the world computer: it is a blockchain that supports a programming language. In theory, anything that can be imagined and programmed can be hosted on the Ethereum network.

Applications on the Ethereum network include numerous other cryptocurrencies and financial services including venture capital and insurance, but also smart contracts, social media and even, perhaps controversially, carbon credits. To cap it all, on 11 March, British auction house Christie’s, founded in 1766, sold a crypto-artwork hosted on the Ethereum network for USD 69.3 million. Christie’s, of course, accepted payment in cryptocurrency.

“If Ethereum manages to move to proof of stake, then, by association, all these projects using Ethereum will also be working with a more environmentally friendly blockchain,” Köhler says.

Why can’t all cryptocurrencies move to proof of stake?

“In principle, Bitcoin could do the same,” Stephen Reid says of Ethereum’s shift to proof of stake. So why don’t they?

The problem is that the majority of Bitcoin’s miners and stakeholders, everyone from Elon Musk to the miners of Sichuan, would have to come together and agree to change the underlying design of the blockchain. That would be an almost incredible feat of decentralized democracy.

But this question also assumes that the Bitcoin community even wants to move away from proof of work. “The miners are not interested in moving to proof of stake,” Köhler says. “They make tons of money with the current system and are highly invested in it, so why would they want to move to a different one?”

The problem is that, when the price of Bitcoin rises, miners can use their higher revenues to reinvest in more mining machines, increasing both their profits and their overall carbon emissions. “This relationship needs to be studied further,” Köhler says, “but it seems to be a vicious cycle.”

Bitcoin whales are known for their large transfers. But in the last few months, BTC whales have reduced the selling of BTC significantly, and that has contributed a lot towards the recent surge in the price of Bitcoin. BTC investors are holding their cryptocurrency assets for larger gains in the future.

“In bull markets, old coins tend to move more. This increases the relative supply of younger coins in the network. In previous BTC tops, around 50% of the Bitcoin supply was younger than 6 months. We are currently significantly below this level (36%),” Glassnode mentioned in a tweet.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency touched an all-time high of $61,500 on 14 March. As of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $58,000 with a market cap of more than $1.07 trillion.

$1 Trillion Bitcoin Support

Willy Woo, an on-chain market analyst, recently published the data of Glassnode and mentioned that the $1 trillion market cap is strong support for Bitcoin as nearly 7.3% of Bitcoins last moved at prices above the $1 trillion market cap level.

“This is a pretty solid price validation, $1 trillion is already strongly supported by investors. I’d say there’s a fair chance we’ll never see Bitcoin below $1 trillion again,” Woo said.

BTC is not the only cryptocurrency suffering from the supply crisis. According to the data published by Santiment, Ethereum’s token supply on leading digital exchanges has hit the lowest level in 28 months. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is now trading near $1,800 with a market cap of over $200 billion.","Coinbase has agreed to pay $6.5 million to settle charges that it misrepresented the volume and liquidity of digital assets including bitcoin on its GDAX cryptocurrency exchange platform.

In an administrative order, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission faulted Coinbase’s reporting of transaction information from January 2015 to September 2018.

According to the commission, Coinbase improperly reported transactions between accounts it owned, potentially resulting in “a perceived volume and level of liquidity of digital assets, including bitcoin, that was false, misleading, or inaccurate.”

The settlement announced on Friday covers the reporting of those transactions as well as an allegation that a former Coinbase employee engaged in “wash trading” in August through September 2016 to create “the misleading appearance of liquidity and trading interest” in the Litecoin digital currency.

“Reporting false, misleading, or inaccurate transaction information undermines the integrity of digital asset pricing,” Vincent McGonagle, the CFTC’s acting director of enforcement, said in a news release.

Coinbase has been preparing to go public through a direct listing that is now scheduled for next month. The CFTC’s action “supports claims made by cryptocurrency skeptics that wash trading and similar practices give an artificially inflated appearance of interest or activity in a given digital asset,” Benzinga said.

Wash trading refers to entering into transactions to give the appearance that purchases and sales have been made, without incurring market risk or changing the trader’s market position.

According to the CFTC, the Coinbase employee’s wash trades sometimes made up a substantial percentage of daily trading volume in the contract, ranging from as little as 0.62% to as much as 99.0%.

A Coinbase spokesman said the settlement “does not include any finding of harm to any Coinbase customer” and stressed that the exchange “has always aimed to create a reliable and secure trading environment for the benefit of our customers.”

The CFTC alleged that two Coinbase trading platforms, Hedger and Replicator, matched orders with one another in certain trading pairs but failed to disclose in its reporting of the transactions that it was operating more than one trading program and through multiple accounts.","Despite his professed commitment to sustainability, Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently invested heavily in a commodity whose extreme energy demands and unsavory associations have made it a planetary scourge. Tesla sank $1.5 billion into Bitcoin, the world’s dominant cryptocurrency. Amid a developing climate crisis, Bitcoin is devouring more electricity than all of Argentina. Thousands of high-powered custom computers, wired together in makeshift warehouses throughout the world, are consuming staggering amounts of energy -- more than 60% of which comes from fossil fuels — in pursuit of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These Bitcoin “miners” compete continuously to earn rewards for recording transactions in Bitcoin’s global ledger. The design of Bitcoin ensures that miners must incur a computational cost — and thereby a monetary expense — to participate in the maintenance of the ledger. The result from a mining computation is nothing more than a number that demonstrates to the rest of the network that electricity was consumed. This expenditure of computational effort is the metric that enables miners to reach a consensus on the correct state of the ledger. The digital cash reward for mining — and the amount of electricity that mining eats up -- increase as the price of Bitcoin climbs.

[T]he Bitcoin price surge that followed Tesla’s recent investment will likely cause a jump in Xinjiang’s electricity consumption.

Enthusiasts are quick to defend Bitcoin, claiming that mining uses energy that is renewable or would otherwise go to waste. There’s a bit of truth in that. Mining operations are very mobile, and they gravitate to where there’s an excess of inexpensive power. A favorite example of Bitcoin proponents is China’s Sichuan province, home of the enormous Three Gorges Dam. In the rainy season, the dam’s power output far outstrips demand, so there is ample clean energy for mining at a low price. But more typical is Xinjiang province, a global center for Bitcoin mining due to the availability of ultra-cheap coal-powered electricity. According to Bloomberg, the Bitcoin price surge that followed Tesla’s recent investment will likely cause a jump in Xinjiang’s electricity consumption. Advocates counter that Bitcoin’s benefits merit its consumption of energy. They say there’s inherent value in a system that binds a digital currency to a payment platform, separate from any nation-state or central bank. They tout it being decentralized, discreet and immune from inflation. Indeed, Bitcoin has proven useful in developing countries with shaky banking systems and unstable currencies. A small business in Kenya or Nigeria, for example, can import cell phones from Malaysia without banking fees and cumbersome currency exchanges. International commerce is an area where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have flourished.

Bitcoin still commands strong support in libertarian circles, and that’s significant because right-wing ideologies are historically disdainful of government action to address climate change.

But other justifications of Bitcoin’s carbon footprint are dubious. You may put a high value on anonymity if you want to buy illegal drugs on the dark web or if you’re planning a ransomware attack, but for most of us, it’s not particularly advantageous. The claim about immunity from inflation has been disputed by mainstream economists, and it doesn’t mean much for developed economies that have seen meager inflation for decades. It’s the often-cited rationale of independence from any national currency where Bitcoin’s ideological roots show through. The importance attached to Bitcoin not being bound to a central bank stems from its origins in the cypherpunk movement, a 1990’s Bay Area group focused on using cryptography to political ends. They experimented with cutting-edge concepts like anonymized digital cash that ultimately found their way into the seminal white paper that launched Bitcoin in 2008. Bitcoin still commands strong support in libertarian circles, and that’s significant because right-wing ideologies are historically disdainful of government action to address climate change. David Golumbia’s ""The Politics of Bitcoin"" illuminates the deep connections between crypto-anarchist Bitcoin pioneers and the free-market fundamentalism that still pervades a substantial segment of the Bitcoin community. The Bitcoin universe has expanded far beyond the cypherpunk world, mainly because it has become more of a speculative asset than a medium of exchange. Its market capitalization topped $1 trillion this past February. Risk-tolerant investors are undeterred by Bitcoin’s extreme price volatility.

If you prefer your cryptocurrency without the heaping side of greenhouse gas, you have other choices.","Cryptocurrency ETFs have been the topic of considerable debate in the United States for several years now, with the SEC continuing to claim that the crypto market is too volatile for a fund, lacks sufficient surveillance, and is too easily manipulated.

Yet, the Securities and Exchange Commission is now considering ETF applications from a number of major companies, including WisdomTree, NYDIG, VanEck, and Valkyrie Digital Assets. Grayscale has filed to launch an ETF in the past, but it does not currently have an active filing with the SEC for a Bitcoin- or crypto-related ETF. However, the company says it could push its $35 billion Bitcoin Trust, the largest of its kind, into an ETF.

“We’re not able to provide further detail aside from the fact that we are continuously exploring new opportunities, such as an ETF, in response to customer demand,” Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale’s CEO and managing director, told Bloomberg. “We were the first to provide exposure to a digital asset through a regulated wrapper, and our goal is to ensure that we lead the market in whatever future product we bring forward as well.”

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell seems to agree with the SEC, saying Monday that cryptocurrencies remain an unstable store of value and that the central bank is unlikely to introduce a competitor anytime soon.

“They’re highly volatile and therefore not really useful stores of value and they’re not backed by anything,” Powell said during a virtual panel discussion on digital banking hosted by the Bank for International Settlements. “It’s more a speculative asset that’s essentially a substitute for gold rather than for the dollar.”

Fed Working On Its Own Payment System

In recent years, the Fed has been designing its own payments system that facilitates a more rapid transfer of money, with the unveiling of the final product likely to happen over the next couple of years.","MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor thinks his tweets to Elon Musk deserve some credit for inspiring Tesla’s blockbuster investment in bitcoin.

Saylor became a corporate crypto pioneer last year when his business-intelligence firm started buying up bitcoin with its cash reserves. Tesla followed his lead in February — less than two months after Saylor floated the idea to Musk on Twitter.

In a recent interview with Time magazine, Saylor said his online exchange with the world’s second-richest man may have gotten the ball rolling on Tesla’s decision to buy $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, which he called an “inflection point” for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency.

“All of a sudden, the narrative goes from ‘Those crazy people, what are they thinking, speculating in Bitcoin?’ to ‘Maybe this is a real thing. This is probably not going away. Let’s try to figure out how to think about it,'” Saylor told Time in the interview published Sunday.

The fateful exchange started with a risqué meme Musk posted depicting bitcoin as a female seductress trying to lure a robed man averting his eyes to avoid temptation.

In response, Saylor said Musk should “do your shareholders a $100 billion favor” and convert his electric-car maker’s balance sheet from dollars into bitcoin.

Musk asked if such big transactions were even possible, prompting Saylor to offer to “share my playbook with you offline – from one rocket scientist to another.” Saylor studied aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Musk is also CEO of the rocket-builder SpaceX.

When Time asked whether he thought the exchange had an impact on Tesla’s decision to buy bitcoin, Saylor simply replied, “Yes.” But he declined to say whether he spoke further with Musk because revealing such a discussion would be “against business etiquette.”

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

Bitcoin climbed to a record high after Tesla revealed its investment in early February and has continued to rise despite Musk suggesting its price appeared too high. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency was trading at $57,976.40 as of 7:23 a.m. Monday, up about 3 percent from a day earlier, according to CoinDesk.

In Saylor’s view, the handful of public companies that have invested in bitcoin since last year are just “the tip of the iceberg” for the digital coin’s institutional adoption. Other financial institutions such as Mastercard, BNY Mellon and Morgan Stanley have reportedly embraced cryptocurrency in recent months.

“Bitcoin is not speculation, OK?” Saylor told Time. “Bitcoin is a unique new technology, it’s like the Facebook of money or the Google of money.”","Bitcoin could soar as high as $300,000 in the current bull market based on its historical patterns, according to Bobby Lee, co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BTCC.

However, he warned that the bubble will burst after peaking and the cryptocurrency could see declines for years.

""Bitcoin bull market cycles come every four years and this is a big one,"" said Lee, who is currently the chief executive of crypto wallet Ballet. ""I think it could really go up to over $100,000 this summer.""

Two of these ""mega bull market cycles"" have occurred over the last eight years, he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday, pointing out that the last one was in 2017, when the price of bitcoin surged to nearly $20,000 by the year end from about $1,000 earlier that year.","Bitcoin has been trading relatively sideways this past weekend, holding above a key support level.

Ethereum price has also defended a critical moving average and aims for a breakout soon.

Ripple has outperformed the market as concerns over the SEC’s lawsuit have dissipated slightly.

The cryptocurrency market remained quite flat during the past weekend, but most indicators show top cryptos are on the verge of significant breakouts. Bitcoin is looking to take the lead again despite a drop in dominance toward 60%.

Bitcoin price faces no strong resistance ahead of all-time highs

Bitcoin is trading at $58,130 at the time of writing and is holding above the 26 EMA support level on the daily chart. This moving average is a crucial support point for the bulls.

BTC/USD daily chart

A breakout above the previous all-time high of $61,844 should swiftly drive the Bitcoin price toward $76,199 at the 127.2% Fibonacci level. The In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) chart shows practically no resistance ahead.

The strongest barrier is located between $58,578 and $59,000, with a total volume of 124,000 BTC. On the other hand, losing the 26 EMA support level, currently located at $54,300, would push the Bitcoin price down to the psychological level of $50,000, which coincides with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level.

Ethereum price trades between two key levels

On the 4-hour chart, the Ethereum price has established a descending triangle pattern with its resistance trend line formed at $1,830 and support at $1,740.

ETH/USD 4-hour chart

For a breakout, Ethereum also has to conquer the 50 SMA resistance level at $1,808 and then beat $1,830, which should drive the Ethereum price up to $2,000 in the short term.

On the other hand, losing the 100 SMA at $1,780 would quickly push ETH down to the lower trend line at $1,740. A breakdown below this point has a price target of $1,567, which is a 10% move calculated using the height of the pattern as a reference point.

Ripple price sees another 7% breakout after SEC lawsuit concerns fade

The SEC sued Ripple for allegedly selling illegal securities in the form of XRP tokens. However, the SEC's lawyer, Jeremy Hogan, stated that although Ripple might have sold XRP illegally, investors did not, which means that exchanges should be safe to list XRP again.

Finally, XRP managed to climb above a critical resistance level at $0.495 with a price target of $0.57, which was almost hit as the digital asset trades at $0.55 at the time of writing. The next target is located at the psychological level of $0.60."

After analyzing the history of the growth Bitcoin, cryptocurrency expert Bobby Lee has projected that the digital currency could reach $300,000 per unit (about 6 million Mexican pesos at the current exchange rate). However, he warned that, after reaching its maximum peak, it will suffer a brutal fall, the damage of which will be impactful for years.

The co-founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BTCC predicted that the Bitcoin ""bubble"" will burst, causing a long-term decline.

""Cycles of rise in the Bitcoin market happen every four years and this is a big one,"" explained Lee, who is currently the CEO of Ballet, an app that works as a cryptocurrency wallet. ""I think it could really go up to more than $100,000 this summer,"" added the expert, in an interview with CNBC .

In the last eight years, there have been two of these ""bull cycles,"" and the last one was in 2017. On that occasion, Bitcoin started the year with a price close to $1,000, and closed at almost $20,000.

Is ""Bitcoin winter"" coming?

Bobby Lee explained that Bitcoin ""could go down a lot and that's when the bubble bursts."" He explained that ,in the crypto asset industry, it is known as ""Bitcoin winter"" and that it ""can last two to three years.""

Taking into account that Bitcoin started 2021 trading at around $30,000 per unit, the specialist predicts that it could reach ""even a value 10 times greater than that."" That is, the most popular cryptocurrency would reach $300,000, but he clarified that he is not sure that history repeats itself.

In the first quarter of 2021 alone, Bitcoin has broken its own records several times. At the beginning of March, it reached an all-time high, exceeding $60,000 per unit.

Currently, the price of Bitcoin is around $55,000 (about 1,144,602 Mexican pesos), according to data from CoinDesk and CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin may be entering the second half or later stages of a bull market, crypto analysts at Glassnode said on Monday, as nervousness grows in some quarters about a plunge in the price.

Glassnode's weekly analysis found that there had been a pickup in ""wealth transfers"" from long-term bitcoin holders to newer speculators, which the company said was reminiscent of market peaks.

The report said bitcoin bull markets eventually reach a ""euphoric top"" that materializes as big holders increasingly spending their coins to realize profits.

Glassnode estimated that long-term bitcoin holders had reactivated about 9% of supply so far in 2021 by spending coins, though this was below the 17% reactivation before the market's crash in 2017.

""These studies suggest conditions are similar to the second half or later stages of a bull market,"" Glassnode said.

The bitcoin price was down 6% on Tuesday, to $54,294, well off a high of $62,000 earlier in March but still up by about 700% from a year ago.

Glassnode also said on Tuesday that the biggest players - wallets with 1,000 to 10,000 bitcoins - had cut their holdings by 307,000 bitcoins since December.

Timothy Peterson, an investment manager, tweeted that falls in big holdings ""are often but not always associated with bear markets.""

On Monday, Bobby Lee, the founder of the crypto exchange BTCC, told CNBC that 2021 would be a bull market for bitcoin, of the sort that comes around every three or four years. He said the bitcoin price could go as high as $300,000 this year.

But Lee said that the ""bubble"" was likely to pop. ""People should be aware that it could fall as much as 80% to 90% of its value from the all-time peak,"" he said.

However, many bitcoin advocates have pointed to growing institutional interest as a reason bitcoin is unlikely to crash as it has in the past. Visa, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan are some of the latest big names to get involved.","If somebody mentioned Bitcoin some years back, nobody would've cared to know what it is. Even the term cryptocurrency was foreign to some individuals a few years back.

Although many people have heard about cryptocurrencies, others think about it as a form of underworld banking or currency with crooks doing shady deals behind computer monitors.

But that's far from the truth. Bitcoin is an electronic currency that people use the same way they spend fiat money. You can also read about Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency online. Many financial publications, websites, and blogs feature loads of articles about Bitcoin. Essentially, you can quickly learn about this cryptocurrency over the internet.

What is Bitcoin?

People use different terminologies to define Bitcoin. Some people call it a cryptocurrency, while others use digital currency. Some individuals refer to Bitcoin as a virtual currency. But, all these terms are correct. That's because Bitcoin is digital money. It's a form of electronic cash or money. That means you can't have physical Bitcoins in your pocket. Ideally, Bitcoin resides in computers and mobile devices only.

But regardless of how you define Bitcoin, does it deserve the attention it is getting? Why is Bitcoin so important? These questions may linger in your mind on realizing how much attention people are giving this cryptocurrency.

Why Bitcoin is So Important

As hinted, Bitcoin is a virtual or digital currency. Like other cryptocurrencies, blockchain is the basis of Bitcoin. That means it is entirely decentralized. Essentially, no central bank, government, or authority can control or regulate Bitcoin. A peer-to-peer community comprising networked computers maintains the Bitcoin network. Each user is considered a node and has equal rights in the network.

Using blockchain creates an effective digital database or a distributed public ledger. And this ledger runs through cryptography, and it records all Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin mining is a process via which miners confirm every transaction manually. And this makes Bitcoin transactions secure.

Through the mining process, all information that enters the Bitcoin blockchain undergoes mathematical checking. The Bitcoin network confirms and verifies all entries into a public ledger. Miners also check any change in the database.

Bitcoin is one of the pioneer cryptocurrencies to use blockchain technology. Since the introduction of this cryptocurrency in 2009, no hacker has managed to infiltrate it. And this has proven to most investors that it's a safe investment.

What's more, the meteoric rise of Bitcoin's value has captured many investors' attention. Today, people are trading this cryptocurrency on platforms like Bitcoin Loophole. These are known as crypto exchanges that facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies. Perhaps, you can visit this trading app

Bitcoin has also proven to be a valuable value storage asset. That's why some people compare it with gold. During an economic crisis, Bitcoin has proven its ability to withstand challenges better than fiat money. Thus, you can use this cryptocurrency to store value during a financial crisis.

Why You Should Care

Many people are looking for opportunities to invest in Bitcoin. Even large corporations are collaborating with existing crypto clients. More stores, both online and local, are gradually accepting Bitcoin payments. The crypto market is growing with more people buying and selling Bitcoin for profit. What's more, the number of people using Bitcoin to store value is increasing by the day.

These are valid reasons to care about Bitcoin. If you've not thought about investing in or trading Bitcoin, you probably should. If you run a store or provide services, you might want to start accepting Bitcoin payment. That's because if you don't do that, you will lag behind your competitors.

Nevertheless, take your time to understand Bitcoin, how it works, and how to trade or invest in it. That way, you can decide from an informed viewpoint when dealing with this cryptocurrency.","LONDON (Reuters) - Most wealth managers and financial advisors are still in “education mode” on cryptocurrencies but demand for the emerging asset class among larger investors has grown, the boss of Fidelity Investments’ institutional arm said on Tuesday.

While some advisors and investment firms managing the fortunes of wealthy people have grown “sophisticated” and “comfortable” with cryptocurrencies, most are still getting to grips with the technology, Mike Durbin said.

“They know what they are doing, and more importantly their end investor base also knows what they are doing - but the vast majority are still in the education mode,” he added in an interview at Reuters Digital Assets Week.

Durbin’s comments give a snapshot of interest in cryptocurrencies at Boston-based Fidelity, whose $9.8 trillion in customer assets as of Dec. 31 make it one of the world’s biggest investment managers, amid heightened interest in digital assets.

BOOMING BITCOIN

Bitcoin powered to an all-time high of nearly $62,000 this month, the latest in a meteoric rise fuelled by bigger U.S. investors.

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency has soared eight-fold in the last year, sparking wider interest in digital assets from investors seeking yield in a world of ultra-low interest rates.

Mainstream companies and financial firms from Tesla Inc to Bank of New York Mellon Corp have embraced the emerging asset, sparking predictions that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will become a regular part of investment portfolios.

In 2018, Fidelity became one of the first mainstream investment firms to embrace cryptocurrencies, setting up a unit that offers cryptocurrency custody and other services for financial firms and corporations.

Interest in bitcoin and other digital assets would likely grow as “alternative investments” - which often includes real estate, private equity and hedge funds - increase in popularity, Durbin said.

“I think that the growth rate of bitcoin or digital assets will follow in that wake of broader alternative investments.

“There’s still work to be done there to help advisors understand portfolio construction with these kinds of expressions.”","The unimaginable highs that Bitcoin has soared to could very well be followed by long spells of decline in the cryptocurrency’s value, co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BTCC Bobby Lee has said.

Based on the cryptocurrency’s historical patterns, the expert said that Bitcoin could soar to even $3,00,000 in the current bull market. Lee, however, was also quick to add that once the Bitcoin bubble bursts, it could see a decline for many years.

Explaining that the Bitcoin market had a pattern of operating in four-year bull cycles, he said, “I think it could go up to over $1,00,000 this summer”. The previous jumps in Bitcoin value were seen in 2013 and 2017. In 2017, the price of Bitcoin surged to nearly $20,000 by the end of the year, from nearly $1,000 at the start of the year.

With the cryptocurrency hitting $30,000 at the beginning of 2021, Lee noted that “even just a 10x value” would elevate the value of Bitcoin to $3,00,000.

Clarifying that he was not sure if history would repeat itself, he added that if this bull-market pattern has held, it is likely that a repeat of the 2009 lull would also occur.

“Bull-market cycles come and go. And after a bull-market peak, it can inevitably go down and that’s when the bubble bursts,” he said. “It (Bitcoin) could go down by quite a bit and that’s when the bubble bursts”.

Describing the fallout with the term “Bitcoin winter”, he said, “In the bitcoin crypto industry, we call it ‘Bitcoin winter’ and it can last from two to three years,”, adding, “Bitcoin is very volatile, but the rewards are risk-adjusted, I think”.","Norway is ahead of the game when it comes to things like work-life balance and raising children. You can add to that commerce: Norway is the world's most cashless country, according to its central bank, with just 4% of their payments made with cash and the majority made with contactless cards or digital wallets.

But even with this forward-thinking behavior, the country's central bank is not recommending bitcoin as an alternative to fiat, or government-backed currency, because it's ""far too resource-intensive, far too costly and most importantly, it doesn't preserve stability,"" Oystein Olsen, the governor of Norges Bank, told Bloomberg.

Those who argue in favor of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, often say that it's a hedge against inflation and the U.S. dollar – some bitcoin bulls even think it will eventually overtake the dollar as the world's reserve currency.

However, Olsen does not agree.

""[T]he basic property and task for a central bank and central bank currency is to provide stability in the value of money and in the system, and that is not done by bitcoin,"" Olsen told Bloomberg.

But because of the growing interest in cryptocurrency globally and the low level of cash use in Norway, Norges Bank deputy governor Ida Wolden Bache did acknowledge questions raised surrounding the creation of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, in November.

A CBDC would differ from a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, in many ways, but importantly because a CBDC would be issued and backed by a country's central bank to compliment physical cash, rather than replace it entirely, and offer a more stable alternative.

Although Norway's central bank is assessing the need for a CBDC, ""[t]he prospective introduction of a CBDC is still some way off,"" Wolden Bache said in November. ""The lack of urgency reflects our view so far that there is no acute need to introduce a CBDC.""

While some, like the central banks of Sweden, China, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, have started projects introducing CBDCs, others, like Norway and the U.S., are more hesitant. There are upsides to a CBDC, but there are also privacy and surveillance risks attached, for example.

In fact, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said during a virtual panel discussion on digital banking on Monday that the U.S. is in no rush to introduce a CBDC – ""you can expect us to move with great care and transparency,"" Powell said.

Like Olsen, Powell has a similar opinion of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

""They're highly volatile and therefore not really useful stores of value and they're not backed by anything,"" Powell said on Monday. ""It's more a speculative asset that's essentially a substitute for gold rather than for the dollar.""

Bitcoin's price has fluctuated, but as of 2:08 p.m. EST on Tuesday, it's priced at $55,642.38 with a market cap of over $1 trillion, according to Coin Metrics.

All in all, it's fair to say that for most countries, the creation of a CBDC is a ""likely"" scenario, James Ledbetter, editor of fintech newsletter FIN and CNBC contributor, previously told CNBC Make It, as ""the vast majority of central banks in the world have already been doing research on this.""

""Digital currencies more generally are the new wine, in many respects,"" Olsen told Bloomberg, with ""central banks entering the scene.""

He added, ""I don't think at the end of the day [bitcoin] will be a threat to central banks, although some people talk about that.""

As of writing, the world’s 10th largest cryptocurrency is trading near $11.15 billion with a market cap of around $11.2 billion. The recent boom in altcoins has contributed a lot towards the jump in the price of Theta. The cryptocurrency assets like IOTA, Filecoin, TRON, Kusama and BTT have also posted strong gains in the last 7 days. The surge in altcoins is causing a drop in the market dominance of Bitcoin.

The Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged yet another bitcoin ETF proposal last week, this one from VanEck. It's the latest of more than a dozen tried-and-failed proposals from numerous firms over the years, and VanEck's second.

The SEC now has 45 days to approve, deny or prolong its review of the proposal. But with the Biden administration appointing officials to the SEC who have expertise in cryptocurrency markets, approval may be closer than ever, said John Davi, CEO and chief investment officer at Astoria Portfolio Advisors.

""It's just a matter of time,"" he told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" on Monday. ""I think the time has come and there is a place in people's portfolio for digital assets.""

Though Davi recommended investors put no more than 5% of their portfolios toward crypto assets, ""it's better to have a listed, pooled vehicle as opposed to going on an exchange and paying tons,"" he said.

""There's plenty of other ETFs in the ecosystem which are much more obscure, triple-levered — you know, natural gas ... and VIX futures — so, I just think it's the time for it,"" Davi said.

Bitcoin, which doubled in price this year to an all-time high above $61,000 earlier this month, has failed several times to push ever higher.

One blockchain data point known as “reserve risk” offers hints as to where bitcoin is in its market cycle. It’s a picture of an asset price that has room to run before making a final push to a new market top. But that leg up might not be far away.

The reserve risk, a metric was created by the blockchain data firm Glassnode, used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of bitcoin. Currently, it sits at about 0.008, far below the peak zone of the three past bull markets.

The market previously topped when the reserve risk went above 0.02, shown in the red zone in the chart below:

Jean-Baptiste Pavageau, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha, said Monday’s correction may have partly been caused by traders squaring positions ahead of a major options-market expiration date expected on Friday. Once that’s out of the way, some short-term selling pressure might abate.

Data from Bybt shows that bitcoin options strike prices are clustered between $40,000 and $52,000. Many of those contracts are likely so far out of the money that an unwinding of positions ahead of the expiration looks unlikely.

Pavageau sees bitcoin prices consolidating in the $50,000 to $60,000 range after leaving behind a support level around $45,0000.

Bitcoin’s “overall upward trend” remains “intact,” he said.

Rishi Ramchandani, director of business development at crypto lending platform BlockFi, noted that trading volumes have been “quieter” during the market’s latest move down.

Ramchandani says prices are likely to “hover around $55,000 to $60,000 unless we see a news catalyst.”

Bitcoin rose 5% after Elon Musk said a Tesla car can now be purchased using the world's most popular cryptocurrency.

The ""Technoking"" said in a tweet early Wednesday the EV-maker has added bitcoin as a payment option. The choice is currently available to customers in the US, but will be made available elsewhere later this year, Musk said.

""Tesla is using only internal & open source software & operates Bitcoin nodes directly,"" he said. ""Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.""

Nodes are computers that validate bitcoin transactions.

Musk published his tweet soon after Twitter users noticed the updated bitcoin support for all models of Tesla's cars across online US stores. ""Elon,"" ""Tesla,"" and ""#Bitcoin,"" quickly became trending hashtags on the social media platform.

Hopping on this trend, one Philly company has decided to go all in with its commitment to cryptocurrency.

RushOrderTees is investing $1 million of its cash reserves in Bitcoin, Ethereum and a number of other cryptocurrencies within the next two months. With this move, the custom t-shirt printing company based in Northeast Philadelphia joins the likes of Elon Musk’s Tesla and Virginia-based MicroStrategy, which have made headlines in recent weeks for purchasing $1.5 billion and around $1.27 billion in Bitcoin, respectively.

RushOrderTees CEO and cofounder Mike Nemeroff already has experience investing in cryptocurrency and said the low risk and high reward of investing in bitcoin made his company’s decision to invest a simple one.

“I’ve been investing in crypto personally for three or four years,” he told Technical.ly. “It’s more than Bitcoin. It’s Ethereum and other currencies I’ve gotten used to over the last few years.”

Nemeroff explained that in the worst-case scenario, the investment would turn over a zero sum of investment. But in a more positive scenario, it would multiply the $1 million in bitcoin five times, bringing its value to $5 million in bitcoin.

Within the next two years, Nemeroff predicts that more companies will begin selling and accepting cryptocurrency. Payments company PayPal already allows users to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency. Once more companies start participating and cryptocurrency becomes more widely accepted, his company’s investment will seem more commonplace, he said.

For Nemeroff and his colleagues, the decision also affirms RushOrderTees’ status as a technology company: Just as Tesla is a tech company that happens to sell cars, he said, RushOrderTees is a tech company that happens to sell t-shirts.

Nemeroff has some tips for other companies hoping to also invest in bitcoin. It’s not something that can happen instantly and requires planning before one can begin making transactions, he said.

“It’s really easy to buy personally, but it takes more time to buy under your company properly,” he said. “Set up a Coinbase Prime account as soon as possible, because it takes a few weeks to get authenticated.”

It remains to be seen how much RushOrderTees’ investment in cryptocurrency will pay off, but the decision to start investing now shows how bitcoin is steadily becoming involved in the way leaders at companies think about the future.

Pros are also casting a wide net when it comes to forecasting the cryptocurrency’s price.

Supply of Bitcoin is dwindling because institutional investors are piling into the market, and many retail investors are holding onto the cryptocurrency for longer periods of time.

“From March 8 to March 15, CNBC International conducted a survey of 20 investing strategists to get their take on bitcoin, which began moving higher in the fourth quarter of last year and has skyrocketed about 85% so far this year,” reports Tanvir Gill for CNBC. “CNBC offered the strategists anonymity in exchange for their views. They shared their unofficial price targets for bitcoin over the next 12 months.”

Momentum plays an important role in when to buy Bitcoin, but what may be surprising is that buying the cryptocurrency after it has experienced big rallies can be a winning strategy. Some crypto market observers believe the long-term outlook remains encouraging for the largest digital currency.

Scattered Bitcoin Bets

“A slim majority of respondents reported they still are not professionally investing in bitcoin, with 12 of 20 strategists saying they are neither buying the cryptocurrency nor advising clients to do so,” according to CNBC.

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has been invariably linked with talk of a Bitcoin ETF. These conversations are prompting some market observers to speculate on how such a fund, assuming it comes to life, will affect prices of the largest digital currency.

Predictably, Bitcoin bulls largely favor an ETF linked to the king of cryptocurrencies, a sentiment largely rooted in the notion that the fund would stoke higher prices and wider acceptance of digital currencies.

Key Takeaways Tesla has reworded its Bitcoin payments policy, and some have interpreted this to mean it is considering other cryptocurrencies.

An recent exchange between MEGA's Kit Dotcom and Tesla's Elon Musk discussed the merits of Bitcoin Cash.

Tesla has made no definitive statement on the matter, meaning it is unlikely that it will accept altcoins any time soon.

Share this article

Rumors are circulating that Tesla is considering accepting cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, due to statements by CEO Elon Musk and changes to wording on the firm’s website.

Tesla Changes Poilcy Wording

Tesla announced yesterday that customers can purchase the company’s electric vehicles with Bitcoin, a feature that has been underway since the firm made a crypto investment last month.

The company attracted further attention when it changed the wording on its Bitcoin policy earlier today. Initially, Tesla’s policy stated: “Bitcoin is the only digital asset that we accept… at this time. You may not make purchases with us using any other digital asset, including Bitcoin fork products, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.”

That section now simply reads: “Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency Tesla accepts” and “We will not receive the transaction and it will likely result in a loss of funds for you.”

While some see this change as a reaffirmation that Tesla is not interested in other cryptocurrencies, others see the fact that Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV are no longer explicitly excluded as a sign that Tesla is relatively open to those cryptocurrencies.

Elon Musk Acknowledges BCH

Without any formal statement from Tesla, it is hard to say what it plans to do next. However, Musk incidentally commented on Bitcoin Cash at about the same time the policy was reworded.

The comment was prompted by an exchange with MEGA founder Kitcom Dotcom, who noted that Bitcoin Cash has lower average fees than Bitcoin. Musk responded that Dotcom had a “fair point,” implying that he is personally open to other cryptocurrencies.

Fair point — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 25, 2021

Prices Affected By Events

The controversy appears to have had a modest effect on the value of Bitcoin Cash. The coin’s price suddenly dropped from $506 to $461 shortly after Musk’s tweet, representing a 8.89% loss.

It is possible that other factors are at play, given that the events had no decisive outcome. Nevertheless, discussions on social media and other news sites likely influenced investor behavior.

Prices have largely recovered since the event: Bitcoin Cash’s price is down just 6.6% over the past 24 hours, a change roughly in line with Bitcoin’s 5.6% loss over the same period of time.

Purchasing one of the electric cars with bitcoin could end up being more expensive than buying in cash or on credit, depending on when a customer first acquired their share of the cryptocurrency. That's because the Internal Revenue Services sees spending bitcoin — or even converting it back to US dollars — as a realization of investment gains, and therefore subject to the capital gains tax. It's not unlike selling a stock or bond.

The amount of tax a person will have to pay on a transaction involving bitcoin depends on how long they've had the cryptocurrency and how much it gained in value since it was bought.

IRS rates for capital gains taxes on assets that have been owned less than a year are taxed in the same brackets as a person's other income, while long-term capital gains are taxed at 15% for individuals who earn between $40,000 and $441,000 — and 20% for individuals that make more than that amount.

For investors that bought into bitcoin early, using the digital currency to buy a Tesla car could be very expensive. Even those who bought bitcoin a year ago — when it was valued at about $6,500, or almost one-tenth of today's prices — would be paying almost as much as their initial bitcoin investment in taxes just from buying one of Tesla's cheapest vehicles. That's on top of any additional sales taxes in the purchaser's state.

On the other hand, the bitcoin purchase could present a tax break for more recent bitcoin investors. If an investor bought bitcoin this year at a higher price than its current value, the individual could report a loss and receive a tax deduction for the following year.

Tesla car prices range from $39,000 for the Model 3 to over $80,000 for the Model X, according to Tesla's site.

In Tesla's bitcoin terms and conditions, the company highlights several risk factors associated with using bitcoin as a mode of purchasing its electric cars.

The purchases are not set at static bitcoin prices, but rather a bitcoin equivalent to the price of the car in US dollars given by Tesla at a certain time and only valid within a time period set by Tesla. Due to the volatility of bitcoin, any Tesla returns would be a gamble, as the company would return the payment in the form of bitcoin — a risk Tesla highlights in its terms and conditions.

""The price of Bitcoin can be volatile and subject to upward and downward movements,"" the statement reads. ""If we refund you in Bitcoin, the value of such amount of Bitcoin relative to U.S. dollars might be significantly less than the value of such amount of Bitcoin relative to U.S. dollars at the time of purchase.""

Bitcoin purchases are irreversible, so any error in the initial transaction would be at the customer's own loss. The buyer will also be subject to bitcoin network fees which have spiked to as much as $60 in the past.","Ethereum has long been called the “second cryptocurrency,” but its potential is much more serious than BTC, according to Brian Kelly.

Brian Kelly is the founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, a cryptocurrency fund. While the world's attention is focused on Bitcoin (BTC), he highlights Ethereum as a more reliable and promising investment asset.

""The fact that BTC is now the fastest growing and most expensive cryptocurrency does not mean that it will not be overtaken by another, more interesting competitor in the next 10 or15 years,"" says Kelly.

So why Ethereum? Kelly identifies 3 main reasons why you should pay attention to the ""second cryptocurrency"" instead of the market leader.

1. ""Ethereum futures are just around the corner""

Even considering that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decreed that Ethereum is not a stock, the introduction of ETH futures is quite possible, because there is already an Ethereum index, Kelly said.

""After the introduction of the ETH index, the value of the cryptocurrency soared by 30% in just a week. It is possible that if the futures are approved, the cryptocurrency will repeat or even surpass this growth,"" he explains.

2. Cryptocurrency mining software

One of the main reasons why Bitcoin is worse than ETH is the terrible harm to the environment from “mining” of the first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is mined using graphics cards, which, in the process, emit a huge carbon footprint, comparable in scale to a country like New Zealand.

At the same time, ETH is much more environmentally friendly, which is especially important in view of the upcoming UN meeting regarding the ecology, believes Kelly.

3. Ethereum is not just a currency

The third and perhaps the main feature of Ethereum is that it is not only an asset for saving or speculation, it is a whole ""decentralized prediction market!"".

The decentralized and unregulated prediction platform Augur has been in development for about 3 years, the exact time is unknown. Its task is to analyze a huge amount of information (news, support and resistance levels, crowd behavior and a million more different factors) in order to produce unmistakable forecasts and signals for trading in the cryptocurrency market.

Although the platform is not ready yet, you can already find an unofficial project on the net that uses the Augur technology. Officially, the partnership between CryptoTrader and the Augur platform has not been confirmed, but the huge number of profit publications speaks for itself.

Here are some examples:

“Ethereum-linked platform gives recommendations on the purchase or sale of its own cryptocurrency. It sounds absurd, but it's true!”, says Kelly.

“So far, the platform successfully predicts the movement of other currencies, as well. You can see for yourself”, says the investor.

“You can make money on speculation, but this is a big risk, you need to have knowledge and skills to predict cryptocurrency movements. I remain loyal to Ethereum cryptocurrency, so much so that 20% of my assets are invested in ETH. But now there is a more interesting and reliable option – CryptoTrader. I will continue to follow the development of this platform and its results. I can afford not to stretch for yield,” concluded Kelly.

Canadians have many options to bet on Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and many other cryptocurrencies that have been red-hot of late. The whole process of setting up a crypto wallet and securing your keys can be daunting for everyone.

There has been no shortage of ads promoting Bitcoin these days. However, I ultimately believe that the best way to own cryptocurrencies is not through a wallet, but through various other means, which are far more secure. We’ve heard the stories of Bitcoin millionaires losing access to their fortunes through innocent, trivial mistakes. It’s easy to lose the keys to your wallet. Like hoarding gold bullion, you need to think about security and protect your investment from theft or loss.

Tempted by Bitcoin? Opt for a TSX-traded security

I’m a huge advocate of owning precious commodities, whether it be metals like gold, silver, or palladium, or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, through a security.

These days, there are a growing amount of securities that can provide you Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exposure for a very low cost, with security thrown in. That’s the type of peace of mind that money can buy. And investors should be more than willing to pay-up for trusted custodians securing their valuable assets.

In this piece, we’ll look at three tops ways for Canadians to bet on Bitcoin and the like. But be warned, I wouldn’t allocate more than 3-5% of a portfolio in any cryptocurrency, even if you’re a raging bull. If you’re bullish, keen, and are willing to ride a 50-80% drop in cryptocurrency prices, only then do you have my blessing to buy into the following Bitcoin and crypto securities. With that warning out of the way, let’s have a look at three top crypto securities:

A cryptocurrency miner

First up, we have the miners, which should be viewed as a leveraged way to play the price of underlying cryptocurrencies. They can maximize your gains if you’re a raging bull. At the same time, they can suffer from amplified damage if cryptocurrencies were to collapse in price.

Story continues

If you’re comfortable with losing 80-90% of your investment for a shot at amplified gains, only then would I bet on a crypto miner. In Canada, HIVE Blockchain Technologies (TSXV:HIVE) is a great way to expose yourself to a diversified mix of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ethereum classic.

For hungry upside-seeking investors looking for crypto exposure beyond Bitcoin, HIVE stock is the way to go. Just because the folks at HIVE won’t lose their tokens doesn’t mean you can’t lose your shirt, however. So, only invest what you’re comfortable with losing! Bitcoin and Ethereum are already volatile on their own. HIVE stock adds another layer of volatility on top. In late 2017 and early 2018, the last time the crypto trade went up in smoke, and HIVE stock lost over 90% of its value.

Bitcoin ETFs

If you seek more direct exposure to Bitcoin, Canada’s lineup of Bitcoin ETFs is probably more your cup of tea. Canada’s first Bitcoin ETF, Purpose Bitcoin ETF, is a great way to play the cryptocurrency. The ETF holds Bitcoin safely and soundly in cold storage, with zero wallets required. Better yet, the ETF is pretty liquid and is both TFSA and RRSP eligible. The major downside of the ETF is its hefty management fee, which is pinned at 1%. That’s steep.

The CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, Canada’s third Bitcoin ETF, is the lowest cost solution in the galaxy, or at least on the TSX Index so far. CI’s offering shares many of the same features of Purpose’s ETF but with a far lower management fee of 0.4%. That’s as good as it gets as far as low cost Bitcoin ETFs are concerned.

Foolish takeaway

As a cautious investor, I prefer the CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF for the low fees. But if you’re getting into the crypto world for a shot at big gains and not just for diversification, it’s tough to beat HIVE stock. And if you go the cryptocurrency miner route, make sure you’ve got a strong stomach because you’re going to need one!

Motley Fool Canada 2021","Cryptocurrency exchanges aren’t seeing a much-anticipated surge in bitcoin (BTC) purchases by retail customers using the $1,400 stimulus checks they received from the U.S. government as part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill.

The news might come as a disappointment to bitcoin bulls who speculated the latest round of “stimmy checks” might push up bitcoin prices past $60,000 or beyond. The cryptocurrency is down 11% this week after slipping 2.8% last week. It is changing hands at press time around $51,300.

The checks are still being distributed, so it might be too early to call the hyped-up episode a dud. But that’s what it looks like so far. The Japanese brokerage firm Mizuho relied on a survey to estimate earlier this month that some $40 billion of the latest round of direct stimulus checks could be spent on bitcoin and stocks.

“While it is too early to comment on the amount of money coming to our platform from the recent stimulus, we’d note that during the previous stimulus fundings, we saw significant deposits with like amounts to the individual stimulus checks,” Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager, a U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, told CoinDesk in an email sent by a spokesperson.

An earlier round of stimulus resulted in a spike in deposits that were exactly the same amount as the $1,200 stimulus check at the time, according to an April 2020 tweet by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S.

The tweet has since been deleted, and Coinbase declined to comment on the latest round of stimulus due to the regulatory “quiet period” leading up to its public market debut. Fortunately, the tweet was preserved as a screenshot:

So the question is: Why aren’t the exchanges seeing the flow?

It could be that retail traders are taking a pause after bidding up high-flying tech stocks and cryptocurrencies over the past few months. Trading volumes in call options of stocks favored by members of Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum are down, according to Bloomberg.

The retail trader retreat could also be driven by macro-economic factors. Consumers are more comfortable with spending cash as the U.S. economy recovers from a pandemic-induced recession. Credit card spending among millennials spiked over the past month, according to data from JPMorgan. And that cash hasn’t made its way to cryptocurrency exchanges.

It’s also possible that bitcoin’s doubling in prices has made the cryptocurrency look more expensive to prospective buyers.

There’s still a chance a bitcoin-buying bonanza could materialize: The U.S. Internal Revenue Service expects the next batch of stimulus payments to be issued this week.

But so far? Not much to report.

Kraken, a U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange, also told CoinDesk it hasn’t seen a significant uptick in $1,400 purchases.","A growing number of companies are becoming interested in bitcoin Cesc Maymo/Getty Images

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood says bitcoin investors shouldn't transact with the coin until the tax code is changed.

At the moment, investors need to pay capital gains taxes when they transact with bitcoin or convert it to fiat money.

Wood's comments come just days after Elon Musk announced it's possible to buy a Tesla using bitcoin.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Despite major companies like Tesla now allowing customers to pay in bitcoin, Cathie Wood has advised cryptocurrency investors against using the cryptocurrency as a payment.

During a Thursday webcast hosted by Cboe, the Ark Invest founder cautioned investors who've made profits from bitcoin's rally against transacting with their coin, as they may have to face massive taxes.

""The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your bitcoin, I don't think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front,"" Wood said.

At the moment, the IRS treats bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as ""property,"" like stocks and bonds - not a currency. When investors sell bitcoin for fiat money or use it to purchase a good, they face capital gains taxes. The amount of a tax a person will have to pay on a transaction involving bitcoin depends on how long they've had the coin and how much they've returned on their investment.

Wood's comments come just two days after Elon Musk announced that it's possible to buy a Tesla vehicle in the US with bitcoin. While bitcoin was originally conceived by its founder as a ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system,"" some crypto enthusiasts-like Wood-view bitcoin as more of a store of value asset, akin to ""digital gold.""

Bitcoin fell on Thursday by as much as 6.7%, to $50,440.17, as retail-investor interest slipped and the options market triggered volatility. The coin is still up roughly 672% over the past year.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Key Takeaways Bitcoin has endured an 18% correction over the past two weeks and now sits on top of stable support.

Ethereum whales are slowly reentering the network as a number of new buy signals pop up in the market.

Despite the significant losses incurred recently, it seems that both cryptocurrencies are poised to rebound.

Sidelined investors appear to be taking advantage of a recent downswing to reenter the crypto market. The sudden spike in buying pressure could help Bitcoin and Ethereum prices recover.

Bitcoin Holds Above Crucial Support

Bitcoin suffered a significant correction after rising to a new all-time high of $61,800 on Mar. 13. Its price dropped by more than 18% to hit a low of $50,300 recently. The downswing appears to have been contained by the 50-day moving average on BTC’s daily chart.

That indicator has played a vital role in Bitcoin’s price performance ever since it became came into play on Oct. 9, 2020. It has held through one of Bitcoin’s most significant retracements since that date, serving as a rebound point that drove prices to record highs.

Now that BTC is once again testing the 50-day moving average, a similar market reaction could occur. Bouncing off this support level could push the market value of Bitcoin toward a new all-time high above $70,000. But to do so, Bitcoin would have to slice through a massive supply barrier that lies ahead.

IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model reveals that the $54,800 level represents a significant area of resistance. Over 1.20 million addresses previously purchased more than 752,000 BTC around this price point.

As such, only a daily candlestick close above this price hurdle will help confirm the optimistic outlook.

It is worth noting that further price appreciation may prove challenging from an on-chain metrics perspective.

Market participants do not seem to be attracted to the current price action, as the number of new daily addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain is plummeting. Roughly 530,000 new addresses joined the network today, representing an 11.80% decline in the past week.

This is a negative sign: network growth is often regarded as one of the most accurate predictors of price. Usually, when the network shrinks for a prolonged period, prices tend to tumble.

If Bitcoin fails to hold above the 50-day moving average, a steeper pullback is likely imminent.

The IOMAP cohorts show that the two most critical support areas underneath this cryptocurrency sit at $49,000 and $46,200. Given the amount of interest around these price points, they may have the ability to prevent BTC from going through a steeper correction.

Ethereum Screams Buy

Ethereum has also incurred losses, falling by 20% since Mar. 13 and dropping to a low of $1,540. This could represent a market bottom as multiple buy signals are popping up across the board.

For instance, the TD Sequential indicator presented a buy signal in the form of a red nine candlestick on ETH’s 12-hour chart. The bullish formation suggests that a spike in demand for Ethereum may see prices rise for one to four candlesticks. But if the upward pressure is strong enough, Ethereum might start a new upward countdown.

The buy signal will be confirmed when a green two candlestick starts trending above a preceding green one candle.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) index also favors bullish sentiment. This fundamental index measures the average profit or loss of addresses that acquired Ether in the past month. Each time the 30-day MVRV moves below 0%, a bullish impulse tends to follow.

The 30-day MVRV ratio is now hovering at -3.93%, indicating ETH is currently undervalued. The lower the MVRV ratio becomes, the higher the buying pressure behind Ethereum.

While these technical and fundamental indicators turn bullish, large investors appear to be rushing to add more Ether to their portfolios.

Santiment’s holder distribution chart shows that over the past 48 hours, buy orders behind Ethereum have been filled.

The analytics firm recorded a significant spike in the number of addresses with millions of dollars in ETH, colloquially known as “whales.” Addresses holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH have shot up by nearly 0.60%, and roughly six new whales have joined the network.

The increasing presence of large ETH holders may seem insignificant at first glance. However, when considering that these whales hold between $16 million and $160 million in ETH, the sudden spike in buying pressure can translate into millions of dollars.

If the buying spree continues, ETH may have the ability to advance further and reach a new all-time high of $2,500.

FD Funds Management, a subsidiary of Fidelity, on Wednesday submitted an S-1 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) outlining its intention to financially back the ETF. In the past year, the price of Bitcoin has jumped 687% to about $52,790.

The ETF, called Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, will track the cryptocurrency through the Fidelity Bitcoin Index, which takes spot prices from various Bitcoin markets, including popular exchanges.

This is the latest move by Fidelity to bring cryptocurrencies to mainstream finance. The money manager previously experimented with mining cryptocurrency, allowed clients to donate digital assets to charities, and launched plans to store and trade Bitcoin for professional investors.

However, the ETF still needs to be approved by the SEC, which previously rejected applications for nine Bitcoin ETFs in 2018. The regulator previously argued that the market was not ready for a Bitcoin ETF yet. But last week, the SEC acknowledged a Bitcoin ETF proposal from VanEck."
