2019-11-21,"Bitcoin.com, the firm backed by cryptocurrency investor Roger Ver, is planning to set up a $200 million investment fund to boost bitcoin cash (BCH) adoption.

The fund, dubbed “BCH Ecosystem Investment Fund,” will invest in and incubate payment-related startups that utilize the BCH blockchain and BCH, the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency at present. The fund is targeting businesses like payment gateways, remittance processors and wallets, according to an announcement Wednesday.

“Bitcoin.com receives between 6 to 8 business plans every day from software entrepreneurs leveraging the unique features and capabilities of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Bitcoin.com now has the resources and team to support these BCH entrepreneurs, grow the value of their businesses and spread bitcoin cash adoption,” said Bitcoin.com CEO Stefan Rust, who took over the role in August from Roger Ver, who then moved on to the role of executive chairman.



No concrete details yet

The firm is yet to finalize details of the fund but said it will allow other institutional investors to join it. Projects, looking to get investment via the fund, will “very soon” be able to submit their business plans to Bitcoin.com via a “dedicated landing page.”

Rust has identified up to 20 institutional investors who satisfy “stringent” due diligence requirements, per the announcement. Bitcoin.com said it would charge a fee to help institutional investors manage the fund, on top of the fees to access the underlying payment businesses.

“There is so much great infrastructure and businesses being built in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem every day. Bitcoin.com is going to accelerate the development with our million-dollar ecosystem investment fund,” said Ver.



Several initiatives

Bitcoin.com has recently taken a number of initiatives to grow the BCH ecosystem. Last month, the firm acquired Japanese blockchain development startup O3 Labs to build financial services mobile apps using the BCH network.

Rust said at the time that Bitcoin.com aims to give users ""the ability to manage, grow, and spend [money] ... without the need for traditional banks or financial intermediaries” via these apps.

Bitcoin.com also recently launched a cryptocurrency exchange and was also preparing to launch futures contracts for BCH on a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-regulated exchange.

In Wednesday’s announcement, the firm said the BCH futures contract could launch by the first quarter of 2020.","Dan Schulman, CEO of payment processor PayPal, revealed during an interview that he does indeed own Bitcoin (BTC).

On Nov. 20, Fortune reported that PayPal CEO Dan Schulman stopped by its offices where he discussed a variety of topics, including the reason for PayPal’s withdrawal from the Libra Association and whether he is the proud owner of any cryptocurrencies.

PayPal was the first to leave Libra

Schulman explained that PayPal withdrew from Libra because the company decided to put its attention elsewhere. According to the CEO it was a question of “where do we want to put our attention, and what do we want to do today to advance our mission?” He added:

“You know, we think if we focus on our own roadmap, we’d be able to advance financial inclusion faster than if we put all these resources against Libra.”

Schulman added that Libra will start going down a road that his company remains “very interested in looking at,” and once Libra starts to figure things out, “we’ll take another look at where they are.”

At the beginning of October, a PayPal spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the company had officially left the association, adding that they remain supportive of Libra’s aspirations and continue to look forward to dialogue on ways to work together in the future.

A lot of promise to blockchain technology

PayPal’s CFO John Rainey said in May that the firm has teams that are working on blockchain and cryptocurrency, and that they wish to participate in that technology in whatever form it takes in the future.

In the Fortune interview, Schulman was reluctant to share any significant details as to what exactly PayPal is working on in the sphere, although he was quick to point out that it is not “necessarily competitive with Libra,” adding:

“We think there’s a lot of promise to blockchain technology. It’s intriguing to us, but it really needs to do something that the traditional rails can’t do. Most people think that blockchain is about efficiency, but the system today is pretty efficient.”

Regarding cryptocurrencies, the CEO said that it is still very volatile, and that they do not have much demand for it by merchants because merchants operate on very small margins. He said:

“Until it becomes less volatile, it won’t be a currency that is widely accepted by merchants on the web — not the dark web, but the web.”

As to whether he owns any cryptocurrencies himself, Schulman’s answer was short and straightforward:","Binance has acquired the well-known Indian crypto exchange WazirX, bringing easier cryptocurrency access to a population of over one billion.

According to an announcement published on Nov. 21, users will be able to use Indian rupees (INR) to buy and sell crypto via the Binance Fiat Gateway as early as Nov. 25.

Major morale boost for the Indian community

During the first quarter of 2020, WazirX’s auto-matching engine will be integrated into the Binance Fiat Gateway so that Binance.com users will be able to directly place orders on the flagship exchange to purchase Tether (USDT) against INR. With this integration, any crypto tradeable on Binance.com will become accessible for those who purchase USDT via WazirX.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Kashif Raza — co-founder of the Indian crypto regulatory news and analysis platform “Crypto Kanoon” — welcomed the development, suggesting that the acquisition will provide a major morale boost to the Indian startup space at a time of deep regulatory uncertainty.

This uncertainty is highly likely to have played a role in WazirX’s decision to join forces with a major industry incumbent like Binance, he added.

Back in July 2018 — in the aftermath of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) controversial ban on banks' dealings with crypto-related firms — WazirX had transformed its business model into a P2P platform so as to avoid in-house crypto-fiat conversion.

Other exchanges, like Coindelta, have since been forced to terminate services altogether in light of the adverse operating climate for crypto businesses in the country

“Another step forward in achieving the freedom of money”

In a statement, Binance Chief Financial Officer Wei Zhou remarked that “building fiat-to-crypto bridges remain a key mission for Binance,” adding that the acquisition of WazirX will help Binance in this mission “by providing a simple and cohesive way to purchase cryptocurrencies in a country which is home to more than a billion people.""

Binance’s chief executive Changpeng Zhao has said the move represents “another step forward in achieving the freedom of money.”

As reported, the Indian government recently revealed it has opted not to introduce a draft bill on a potential cryptocurrency ban to parliament in the coming winter session.

The draft bill — entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currencies” — reportedly intends not only to impose a complete ban on the use of crypto in India but also to pave the way for a “Digital Rupee” issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

In late October, Binance launched support for deposits in Nigerian Naira (NGN), announcing that they would add support for fiat trading earlier that month, starting with the Russian ruble.

In mid-October, it launched p2p trading for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and USDT against the Chinese yuan and this month added support for the Turkish lira on its flagship exchange.

To date, Binance has also launched four international crypto-fiat exchanges, including Binance Uganda, European trading platform Binance Jersey, Binance Singapore and Binance US.","When the Bitcoin bubble burst at the end of 2017, the cryptocurrency’s value dropped from over $17,000 to less than $7,000 in just a few days. Global news coverage suggested that the currency boom appeared to have ended abruptly.

But as Bitcoin’s value dropped, something strange happened. The rate at which bitcoins were being created—or mined—increased dramatically. The reason? Despite the fall in value, bitcoin mining was still extremely profitable. In other words, the cost of mining—the price of the hardware plus the energy to run it—was still less than the value of the coins it produced.

This mining boom continued for almost a year. Then in November 2018, Bitcoin’s value dropped dramatically again, this time from about $6,500 to less than $3,500.

This pulled the rug from under many miners. Suddenly bitcoins were no longer valuable enough to cover their energy costs and the mines were shuttered. For the first time in the cryptocurrency’s history, the rate of mining collapsed, falling from 60 exa-hashes per second to just 35.

The impact was significant. Before this, mining had been geographically diverse, preventing one country or region from exerting undue influence. Now mining was possible only where energy was cheap enough to allow a profit—mainly in western China. And China was increasing its scrutiny of cryptocurrencies, shutting exchanges and banning various activities.

This posed an existential threat to Bitcoin. And ever since, cryptocurrency experts have been desperately looking for a fix.

The fundamental issue is that bitcoin mining is computationally expensive. This is a deliberate ploy to make the cryptocurrency secure. But computation is energy intensive. And as interest in the cryptocurrency has increased, so has the amount of energy it uses up.

By some estimates, bitcoin mining currently consumes over 75 terawatt-hours per year, more than the entire electricity consumption of Austria. That’s not sustainable, particularly if Bitcoin continues to grow exponentially, as the cryptocurrency community hopes. So a new way to mine the currency is desperately needed.

Enter Michael Dubrovsky at the nonprofit PoWx, Marshall Ball at Columbia University in New York, and Bogdan Penkovsky at the University of Paris-Saclay in France. These guys have come up with a new way to secure Bitcoin that is computationally expensive but much more energy efficient. Crucially, they say it is also compatible with the current encryption systems and so should be relatively straightforward to include in future iterations of Bitcoin.

Their secret sauce is simple. Instead of relying on conventional computers to do the number crunching, Dubrovksy and co want to use optical computers. They say these devices use significantly less energy and so will fundamentally change the calculus behind bitcoin mining. But are they right?

First some background. Bitcoin is based on a decentralized ledger that records all transactions associated with the currency. This ensures that no single entity controls the currency.

A key idea is that the ledger must be secure so that everyone can trust its contents. This security is achieved by regularly encrypting the ledger so that its content cannot be changed.

The encryption process must have special properties, however. The ledger must be extremely hard to encrypt, but once encrypted, it must be easy to check.

It turns out that there are a set of mathematical objects called trapdoor functions that have exactly this property. Indeed, they are already widely used for encrypting everything from personal messages to credit card transactions.

This form of encryption is computationally expensive—it requires powerful computers that are costly to run. So Bitcoin has another feature that has been key to its success. Anybody who performs the encryption process—the proof of work—is rewarded with newly created bitcoins.

That’s why the process is called mining. As the value of Bitcoin has increased, the popularity of mining has increased too.

But this has a downside. Computation is energy intensive. So miners have looked for various ways of reducing their costs. One development was the introduction of application-specific integrated circuits—ASIC chips—that are optimized for the single purpose of Bitcoin mining. Another was to find cheap sources of energy.

Dubrovksy and co say optical computing changes this calculus. They are inspired by the rapid development in recent years of photonic chips that can compute with much greater efficiency than silicon. “The promise of the technology, is to offer 2-3 orders of magnitude better energy efficiency over electronic processors,” say the team.

To that end, Dubrovksy and co have come up with a revised encryption protocol, called HeavyHash, that is optimized for photonic computers. This means the best results can be achieved only by employing a photonic processor to do the number crunching.

This “optical proof of work” should encourage the adoption of photonic chips and so dramatically reduce Bitcoin’s power budget. “The implementation of optical Proof of Work will help accelerate the development of energy-efficient photonic co-processors,” say the researchers.

When the cost of energy is no longer the main consideration, Dubrovsky and co say, the cost of hardware will dominate the calculations. And that will ensure that miners can work profitably in locations all over the globe rather than only in regions where energy is cheap.

At least, that’s the theory. The problem is that the power efficiency of photonic chips has yet to be clearly established. For example, optical switches work by changing their refractive index, and this is currently done with tiny heaters. Silicon photonic circuits also vary in small ways that must be compensated for with microheaters.

These heaters significantly increase the power budget of the chips in ways that are hard to anticipate. Indeed, Dubrovksy and co do not clearly predict the power savings that may (or may not) be possible as Bitcoin scales. That makes it hard to assess the efficacy of optical proof of work.

Neither do the researchers show how optical proof of work will solve the problem associated with regional differences in the cost of power. In future the hardware costs will be similar for all miners, as they are now. So, in the long term, the best way to maximize profits will still be to find cheap sources of energy.

That’s no different from the problem Bitcoin is currently facing. Which is why it’s hard to escape the conclusion that this form of energy-efficient computing merely postpones the inevitable.

The investment firm, which manages over $700 billion in assets, recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to track shares of its new government money market fund on the Stellar network. The firm will adopt Curv's multi-party computation (MPC) protocols to secure these tokens, while retaining the ability to access them instantly, according to a company statement.

""Curv understood our demanding security requirements and our plans requiring a large scale,” said Franklin Templeton executive vice president Roger Bayston in the statement.

“In comparison to traditional tech stacks evaluated, Curv’s cryptography changes what is possible in digital asset custody, delivering to our clients instant availability and total autonomy over their investments.”

Curv's cryptocurrency wallet solution allows users to take custody of their own digital assets while eliminating the need for private keys. Founded in 2018, the firm counts firms such as cryptocurrency trading shop Genesis Global Trading and digital asset trading platform iTrust Capital as its clients.","Many cryptocurrencies have been launched in the past few years, often to great fanfare and celebration, only to fade and fail as the public and investors shun them. According to Coinopsy, which tracks such failures, there are some 1,085 dead coins at the time of writing. That’s a substantial number, even next to the approximately 3,000 still in existence, and senior industry figures expect many of those to fail, too.

Why do so many of these projects unravel? You expect many initiatives to come and go in a fledgling market, of course – the 1990s dotcom bubble is the perfect example. But at the same time, cryptocurrency developers have traditionally spent too little time designing the business-use case for their coins and tokens, then only realising after the launch that their idea is yesterday’s news.

Time and again, we see launches that copy a previously successful coin – “coin x is the new Bitcoin”, for example. Yet the market already has Bitcoin, and it continues to be in demand – as evidenced by the 18 millionth Bitcoin being mined only last month. We tend to overlook this problem with developers, even while we rightly criticise regulators for not being able to keep up with the fast evolution of the crypto market – despite efforts such as Howey Coin by US regulator the SEC, which was a fake new coin offering designed to teach investors about the risks of putting money into crypto.

No doubt these kinds of developer errors will continue. Here are several other themes that we think will have a bearing on future crypto failures:

1. Big Finance has arrived

Eleven years ago, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto quietly revolutionised money with the release of his or her now famous white paper that outlined Bitcoin. In the early years after this vision took off, many of those who launched altcoins and tokens were small teams of developers and leftfield entrepreneurs. They had a clear mission to bring the world of traditional finance and central banks to its knees with decentralised units of exchange that were beyond anyone’s control.

A few years on, these bank killers have largely been assimilated by the big financial institutions they once sought to challenge. Wall Street is steadily taking charge of the crypto action, professionalising trading with the likes of derivatives and futures products.

We may now be entering a phase where only large institutions will be able to generate profit from cryptocurrency design. It seems increasingly likely that the next revolutionary white paper will be generated by a global multi-billion-dollar firm – an ironic full turn of events, to say the least.

Many other cryptocurrencies from more humble beginnings will fail in future, simply because they don’t have the resources to compete with these huge institutions. They will be driven by sunk costs and the crypto dream to dominate the future of money, but in many cases it won’t be enough.

2. The future is stable

For a cryptocurrency to be successful, two things need to happen: there has to be a reason why people want to use it, and they have to trust it. People will generally trust a coin or token thanks to the underpinning blockchain technology, the decentralised cryptographic ledger systems on which this industry is built.

This means that the basis upon which the market judges if a new launch will stand or fall is mainly its use case. There are now altcoins in existence offering everything from new ways to fund web advertising to units of exchange in the gaming world. But more generally, in a world in which it is no longer enough to simply claim to have launched a better Bitcoin, the market’s attention has pivoted towards stablecoins.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to avoid the wild volatility of cousins like Bitcoin by being pegged or backed by assets like traditional currencies or precious metals. They are designed to encourage people to use cryptocurrency for everyday buying and selling, while also offering a stable store of value for traders on the many crypto exchanges that don’t deal in traditional currencies.

Examples include USD Coin and Tether, both of which are equivalent to US$1. The fact that it takes considerable financial resources and infrastructure to make such coins operational is again likely to favour large institutions – witness Facebook’s attempt to launch the Libra stablecoin, for instance.

3. Losses more foul than fair

Many investors have lost money through scams in the crypto world. One recent notorious example is the alleged OneCoin ponzi scam, in which investors were promised guaranteed 300% returns for investing Bitcoin or US dollars with a Nevada-based outfit.

The money was supposed to be ploughed into foreign exchange options and altcoins, but was allegedly instead used to pay off other investors in the scheme. Fortune magazine recently speculated that OneCoin may have generated losses in excess of the US$19.4 billion (£15 billion) racked up by Bernie Maddoff’s ponzi victims in 2008.

Somewhat different was Bitconnect, an exchange in which investors could swap Bitcoin for Bitconnect coins, which would be lent out with claimed returns of up to 120% per year. After longstanding ponzi accusations, the US authorities stepped in last year and the exchange abruptly closed. Bitconnect coins plunged 96% in value, creating huge losses, though they still exist and trade today.

An alternative problem is hackers raiding exchanges. The most infamous example is the Mt Gox attack of 2014, in which over 850,000 bitcoins were stolen and never recovered. More recently the Binance exchange, one of the world’s largest, has been hacked several times, costing investors tens of millions of dollars.

One other alarming case was that of Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga, who died a year ago. Because nobody had access to his passwords, the investments of 115,000 customers worth US$137m were unrecoverable. When a court-appointed auditor was eventually able to access his account, it turned out the assets had all been sold months before Cotten died.

We fully expect these sorts of problems to continue – and this shouldn’t be surprising. We are talking about a toxic combination of anonymous technology that is largely unregulated, poorly understood, and cheap and easy to move around the world – and many people willing to kiss frogs in their search for a lucrative prince.","It says the receiver’s report to the court found that the Einstein Group has less than $45,000 in cash and cryptocurrency.

2019-11-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin slumped to a six-month low on Friday after China’s central bank launched a fresh crackdown on cryptocurrencies, warning of the risks entailed in issuing or trading them.

Bitcoin BTC=BTSP, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, fell 9% to $6,929, its lowest since May, and was last down 7% at $7,107.

The People’s Bank of China’s Shanghai headquarters said it would tackle growing cases of illegality involving virtual currencies. It also cautioned investors not to confuse crypto with blockchain technology, the digital ledger that underpins many cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

The move came a day after regulators in Shenzhen launched a similar campaign, and came as the PBOC prepares to launch its own digital currency.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month that the world’s second-biggest economy should accelerate the development of blockchain technology.

Bitcoin, known for its wild price swings, soared over 40% in two days after Xi’s remarks, with investors betting that Beijing’s backing of blockchain and plans for a digital renminbi would accelerate the mainstream embrace of cryptocurrencies.

But since late October bitcoin has slumped by nearly a third.

Jamie Farquhar, portfolio manager at London-based crypto firm NKB Group, said the PBOC statement crystallized a growing sense among crypto investors that China’s embrace of blockchain would be unlikely to include cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

“It’s the realization that the positivity over Xi’s blockchain announcement was exaggerated,” he said. “It may not include bitcoin at this point.”","The price of bitcoin and several other major cryptocurrencies have dropped dramatically over the last 24 hours, wiping billions from their value.

Bitcoin fell by more than 10 per cent to take its price below $7,400 (£5,700) for the first time since May, with no sign of the current crash slowing down.

Ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and ripple all saw losses of between 5 and 15 per cent over the last day.

Cryptocurrency analysts struggled to explain the sudden crash but said further losses should not be ruled out.

The market movement comes in stark contrast to bitcoin's generally positive year-to-date, which has seen it rise from below $4,000 in January 2019.

Recent positive developments in the cryptocurrency space had some investors hoping that bitcoin would continue to see gains, especially after both China and the EU appeared to endorse the notion of blockchain-backed digital currency.

Last month Chinese president Xi Jinping described it as an ""important breakthrough"", prompting a state-run newspaper to publish a front-page story about the success of bitcoin.

It came after years of China taking a hardline stance towards the industry and comes amid rumours that the country is preparing to launch its own cryptocurrency next year.

Recommended EU considers launching its own version of bitcoin

One possible explanation for bitcoin's mysterious crash could be further developments in China that saw a fresh crackdown on illegal exchanges.

The country's public endorsement of cryptocurrency seemed to fuel an increase in trading activity on illicit platforms, resulting in a response from the People's Bank of China.

""Once it is discovered, it will be stopped immediately,"" the bank stated.","Shanghai headquarters of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the country’s central bank, has officially announced that it will crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges in the city.

According to an official announcement Friday, the regulator said it will “adopt monitoring measures such as interviews, inspections, and bans on the monitored entities involved in virtual currency activities to resolve related risks in a timely manner.”

Cryptocurrency speculation is rising amidst recent promotion of blockchain technology in China, said the central bank, adding that investors should not mix blockchain technology with cryptocurrencies.

“There are multiple risks in virtual currency issuance financing and trading, including false asset risk, business failure risk, investment speculation risk, etc. Investors should enhance their risk prevention awareness and beware of being fooled. Being cheated,” said the regulator.



The official announcement comes after the Shanghai government, including the PBoC's Shanghai unit, inspected cryptocurrency exchanges in the city this week. The target of this investigation was businesses that conduct cryptocurrency trading, token sales, and distributions of tokens from overseas initial coin offerings.

Earlier today, the government of another Chinese city - Shenzhen - also started investigating cryptocurrency exchanges for illegal activities. The finance bureau of Shenzhen municipality has identified 39 undisclosed cryptocurrency exchanges for the initiative.","Friday, Nov. 22 — Cryptocurrency prices are bleeding heavily, with some of the top-20 coins showing losses of close to 10% on the day.

Cryptocurrency market daily overview. Source: Coin360

Bitcoin (BTC) started the day just above the $7,600 price mark, when it suddenly started on another sell-off towards the $7,000 price level. The coin bounced off a local low of $6,800 in recent hours, before moving up to its current trading price at $7,300, showing a loss of close to 4% on the day.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency is down around 15% from the weekly open of $8,500 and has dragged the entire crypto market into red territory.

BTC could be testing below the $7,000 price mark

Popular crypto analyst and regular Cointelegraph contributor Filb Filb recently said that after looking at the daily chart, “it is clear that Bitcoin has hit the bottom of the downward channel in which it has been trading since July.”

However, Filb Filb pointed out that the price point of $7,600 will be a key level for the bulls to reclaim, which might turn out to be a challenge, especially in the short term. He said:

“Probability would suggest BTC/USD will need to spend a little more time testing below $7,000 before there is a significant bullish reversal.”

Previously Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin tanked due to the multiple rumors currently going around about a crackdown on legitimate Chinese outposts of cryptocurrency businesses. The news appeared to rattle the crypto markets, which slipped into a downwards spiral ever since.

Ether (ETH), meanwhile, saw a painful drop in sync with BTC earlier today. The number one altcoin bounced of its daily low at $141, showing double-digit losses of more than 10% on the day, before moving up to its current trading price of $154 per coin.

All of the top 20 coins are showing red candlesticks, with NEO taking the title of biggest loser, seeing a loss of nearly 10% on the day. Huobi Token (HT) follows closely with a loss of 9% at press time.

The overall cryptocurrency market cap dropped below the 200 billion mark. It currently sits around $198.7 billion, with Bitcoin making up 66.3% of the total.","Bitcoin.com Accelerates Cryptocurrency Adoption With Racer Endorsement

Luke Vanna and the Bitcoin.com car are competing for top honors in the Australian Toyota 86 Racing Series. Sports partnerships like this can introduce cryptocurrency to new audiences as well as attract more businesses to join the ranks of the many merchants already accepting bitcoin cash across the country.

Bitcoin.com in Australian Toyota 86 Racing Series

This weekend, Luke Vanna will be competing in a car exclusively branded with Bitcoin.com’s logo and colors in the final round of the Australian Toyota 86 Racing Series at Newcastle. The Australian racer currently sits fifth in the championship rankings, and could potentially move into the top three this weekend with 300 points up for grabs. He continually places high in Australian racing ranks, and maintains a steady social media following. These factors present him as a great ambassador for Bitcoin.com’s effort to advertise to new markets.

Over the course of 2019, Luke has been helping build the Bitcoin.com brand across Australia at various race events on the Gold Coast and in Melbourne. He has participated in on the ground promotions where he meets people at public events, and promotes Bitcoin.com through his 16,000+ Instagram fanbase. Additionally, the racer has recently secured the services of the Norwell motorplex to offer attendees the chance to win a prize of a day’s training session at the world class motorway, with Luke being the trainer for the session.

“What a privilege it is to be partnered with a global brand like Bitcoin.com. I am looking forward to helping reach the brand across the millions of motorsport race fans here in Australia and throughout Asia,” said Luke Vanna.

The Australian racer has organized events where he interacts with racing fans and introduces them to the world of crypto. At these events, Luke helps fans install the Bitcoin.com Wallet app, and shows them how to add bitcoin cash and begin using it. He has also worked with Bitcoin.com marketing officials to promote BCH to the vendors at the track, encouraging them to accept the cryptocurrency as payment. He’s helped introduce the company to hundreds of thousands of television viewers who watched him during the races with his Bitcoin.com branded car.

Bitcoin Cash Is Skyrocketing in the Land Down Under

Australia is one of the top global hotspots in terms of bitcoin cash adoption. A recent report showed that the number of BCH Australian retail transactions throughout the months of September and October 2019 outpaced every other digital asset by a wide margin. One reason for that is the high concentration of businesses accepting bitcoin cash payments compared to most places around the world. Another cause for the successful BCH adoption rate is the strong and active local community, as evident by hosting what was probably the world’s biggest Bitcoin Cash conference yet in Townsville, North Queensland in September.

“Bitcoin.com is excited to expand our marketing in Australia in this partnership with Luke Vanna. Seeing the interest among new customers we are looking to innovative means to reach them, and meeting them wherever they are,” explained Bitcoin.com CEO Stefan Rust. “Bitcoin cash adoption is skyrocketing in Australia, with 92% of all cryptocurrency retail transactions. Bitcoin.com is committed to expanding the vendor reach for bitcoin cash, and partnerships like this one with athletes and racers in non-traditional locations will only attract new merchants to join the existing 200 BCH accepting merchants across Australia, not to mention users looking to spend their BCH with those merchants seeing value in this trustworthy, reputable payment source.”

The cash-settled contracts will be settled against prices of Bakkt’s physically delivered bitcoin futures contracts, launched in the U.S. in late September. The contracts are sized at one bitcoin and settled in U.S. dollars.

“Our new cash settled futures contract will offer investors in Asia and around the world a convenient, capital efficient way to gain or hedge exposure in bitcoin markets,” said Lucas Schmeddes, president and COO of ICE Futures and Clear Singapore.

Bakkt said as recently as CoinDesk’s Invest: NY event earlier this month that it planned to offer cash-settled futures in Singapore.

The ICE subsidiary also revealed on Oct. 24 that it would “launch the first regulated options contract for bitcoin futures,” also on Dec. 9, and expanded its bitcoin custody offering beyond futures clients to wider institutional clients on Nov. 11. Galaxy Digital became one of the first clients this week, tapping Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Assets to store the bitcoin for two new funds.","A majority of bitcoin holders are making money on their investments despite the cryptocurrency’s drop to six-month lows.

The top cryptocurrency fell to $6,968 during European trading hours Friday – the lowest level in six months, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Currently, the cryptocurrency is changing hands around $7,100, a 48 percent drop from highs above $13,800 seen in June.

Despite the sharp drop, 15.31 million or 54 percent of bitcoin addresses are still “in the money,” according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.

An address is said to be “in the money” if the current price of bitcoin is higher than the average price at which coins were acquired or sent to an address.

The on-chain metric, therefore, indicates the majority of holders have acquired coins below the current price of $7,100.

A closer look at the chart above shared by IntoTheBlock’s CTO Jesus Rodriguez shows most of the in-the-money addresses have purchased bitcoins in the range of $900 to $4,180. A significant number of addresses appear to have purchased at an average cost in the $4,180-$6,631 range.

After all, BTC has traded above $10,000 for only nine months in its lifetime. Further, the cryptocurrency broke above $6,600 in October 2017 – eight years after its creation.

Hence, it’s no surprise that the majority of addresses are still able to sell at a gain. A few of them may have acquired coins during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 when the cryptocurrency was trading in the range of $4,180-$6,631.

The chart also shows that 1.03 million addresses have acquired bitcoins in the range of $6,631 to $7,354. With prices trading near $7,000, a few of them are already out of the money, meaning they would take a loss if they sold now. If the sell-off continues, these addresses may panic and attempt to liquidate their bitcoins, leading to a deeper drop.

That said, BTC is currently far from capitulation – the point of time when investors attempt to exit an investment or market so quickly that they are willing to surrender any and all gains to do so. The panic selling ends up exaggerating the price drop and is widely considered the final stage of a bear market.","After Shanghai, the government of another Chinese city - Shenzhen - is now investigating cryptocurrency exchanges.

The finance bureau of Shenzhen municipality has identified 39 undisclosed cryptocurrency exchanges for inspection, the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily, affiliated with the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shenzhen Committee, reported Friday.

The Shenzhen branch of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), the country’s central bank, will also join the finance bureau for investigation, among other local authorities, per the report.

The authorities will inspect cryptocurrency exchanges for illegal activities, such as money laundering, as cryptocurrency speculation has risen in China among the recent promotion of blockchain tech by the country’s president Xi Jinping.

“The operation will focus on three activities: first, providing virtual currency trading services or opening virtual currency trading places in China; second, providing service channels for overseas virtual currency trading places, including services such as drainage and agency trading; In the name of the sale of tokens, raise funds for investors or virtual currency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum,” per the report (a rough translation from Chinese).

The authorities have been asked to complete the inspection by Nov. 25. If any exchanges are found to be violating rules, they will be required to shut down their businesses.

Just last week, the Shanghai government inspected cryptocurrency exchanges in the city. The target of this investigation was businesses that conduct cryptocurrency trading, token sales, and distributions of tokens from overseas initial coin offerings.

China appears to be taking fresh steps to crack down on the cryptocurrency sector. Earlier this month, Chinese social media site Weibo banned the official accounts of cryptocurrency exchange Binance and blockchain project Tron Foundation, citing ""violations of laws and regulations and the relevant provisions of the Weibo Community Convention."" However, the Weibo accounts of cryptocurrency exchanges Huobi and OKEx are still intact.","“THE MERCY OF THE WAVES”

The smiling boy visited Sunnybrook Yachts in the summer of 2017, after the value of Bitcoin had reached an all-time high, having tripled in five months. Sunnybrook is the largest yacht brokerage on Canada’s east coast. Its clients tended to be surgeons and litigators and C-suiters who travel from Toronto and Paris and Hawaii to summer in Nova Scotia; their wives wear silks and Manolos and perfect fingernails that cost $300 yesterday at the salon. The smiling boy stood out. He wore a wrinkled golf shirt, cargo shorts, and beat-up Birkenstocks, and he was obscenely young, with sandy hair and pale skin that appeared not to have seen sunlight since puberty. He was accompanied by a girlfriend who drove her own Jeep. They struck the yacht salesman as a couple you’d less likely see at Scaramouche than in a Walmart parking lot. Most conspicuous was the odd way that the young man always seemed to be smiling. It was a gentle, unflappable smile. It put strangers at ease; it made him seem lighthearted. It was difficult to imagine that this particular trait was contrived, but later, after it was revealed that nearly everything about him was a work of pure contrivance, you had to wonder whether the incessant smiling was just another part of the act.

This summer day, however, he was dead serious. The smiling boy wanted a big boat.

“What’s your goal?” replied the yacht salesman, in the delicate manner of his trade. A yacht salesman never asked what customers were “looking to spend,” or whether they had ever been on a yacht, let alone knew how to operate one. He summoned a future in which the customer was already a proud captain astride a luxury pleasure vessel dividing a turquoise sea.

“I’d like a boat that I can cruise locally,” said the smiling boy, “and then take south.” He wanted to reach the Caribbean without having to stop in Canada or the United States.

That would require an extra fuel tank, the salesman explained, and a desalination system for drinking water. They settled on a customized Jeanneau 51 with a pink and cream interior: three cabins, a dining area for six, a dishwasher, a gas stove, a washer and dryer, an en suite bathroom with standing shower, and a swim platform with teak battens. When offered an electric motor for the life raft, the smiling boy gestured to his Tesla in the marina’s parking lot. “Sure,” he said. “I love electric.” The whole thing would cost $600,000, but expense never came up—only safety. He named his boat the Gulliver, after the traveler who trusted himself to the mercy of the waves and swam as fortune directed him.

Over several dozen hours of sailing lessons, the yacht dealer learned a few things about his customer. His name was Gerald Cotten, and he went by Gerry; his girlfriend was a property manager named Jennifer Robertson, or Jen; her two Chihuahuas, who liked to sun themselves on the deck as the Gulliver negotiated the islands and shoals of Mahone Bay, were Nitro and Gully. One of those bay islands—four acres of pine encircled by black sand—Cotten purchased that summer. He cleared trees and built a house, though he had no apparent plans to move in. The couple lived in a three-bedroom in Fall River, north of Halifax, a rich suburb only recently carved out of a forest near a long dark lake; Cotten owned a third home in Kelowna, in British Columbia’s wine country; a fourth in Calgary; and 14 rental properties in Nova Scotia, including, in Bedford, every house on a dead-end street. There were also the Lexus and the zippy single-engine airplane, a Cessna 400, which he’d never tried to fly. The couple traveled abroad constantly, and they planned to sponsor a home for 12 children at an orphanage in India. In India, Cotten remarked, the Canadian dollar went a long way.

Cotten rarely brought up his work, but details emerged. He was a founder and the CEO of Quadriga, Canada’s dominant Bitcoin exchange—something like TD Ameritrade for cryptocurrency. He ran the business from his MacBook Pro, which he always carried with him. Once he left it behind on the Gulliver, which caused a momentary hysteria as the yacht had already departed the dock. He had Crohn’s disease and seemed to subsist on hummus; when others drank beer, he produced bottles of hard cider. He loved to fly: planes, helicopters, drones. He seemed like the kind of guy who might retire early to an island somewhere.

OFFICE SPACE

Cotten returned for lessons the following summer, though not as often. He was busy. Then, in December, Robertson called Sunnybrook to explain that Gerry, while on their honeymoon in Jaipur, had died suddenly. She wanted to sell the Gulliver. When national news articles began to appear a month later, they emphasized another detail: Cotten was the only person with the passwords to the accounts holding Quadriga’s funds—cryptocurrency and cash—worth approximately a quarter billion U.S. dollars. Nobody knew how to find the money."
2019-11-23,"A Few Benefits for Bitcoin Beginners to Appreciate

If you are considering entering the crypto universe or if you’ve only recently made your first investment, you might still be exploring the benefits of bitcoin as opposed to your credit card, online bank account or digital wallet you are used to. In an abstract sense, cryptocurrencies represent financial evolution which manifests itself in unique and tangible ways compared to fiat money.

Also read: Here Are Some Fun Things to Do With Bitcoin Cash

Fast and Easy Payments

If there’s one thing cryptocurrency deserves credit for, besides that it makes you a true owner of your money, it’s the ease it brings to electronic payments and transfers. Bitcoin has been around for over a decade now and it is not a tool only for the tech savvy anymore. A myriad of crypto platforms have made it simple to keep and send digital coins. It takes just a few steps to purchase your first cryptos and start spending.

All you need to have initially is a bitcoin wallet and plenty of free options are available. For beginners, a software wallet is probably the best choice and you can download and install a number of mobile applications or desktop programs. If you don’t plan to spend coins on a daily basis and in case you need a higher level of security for your crypto holdings, you’ll be better off with a hardware wallet – getting one is easy too.

With cryptocurrencies, sending money is quick, easy and inexpensive. You just need to have the recipient’s address, which you can either copy and paste in your wallet, making sure the first and the last few digits are the same, or obtain it through a simple QR scan as most wallet apps allow you to do so. After entering an amount, hitting the ‘Send’ button initiates an irreversible transaction; it’s a good idea to set up a spending PIN on your wallet as well.

Low Cost Transactions

Generally, crypto transactions are fast and cheap but the speed and the cost depend on various factors such as the number of transactions a network has to process at a given time and the fee you are willing to pay to the miners. Bear in mind that not all cryptocurrencies are made equal, so to speak. In the case with coins such as bitcoin cash (BCH), transfers are almost instant and often cost less than a penny. That’s regardless of the amount sent or distance covered. With crypto, payments, transactions, and international transfers are faster, easier and safer and you don’t have to worry about progressive fees or bank holidays.

People sending remittances home and companies working with remote contractors abroad often take advantage of that. Besides, bitcoin has another useful feature – you can always check if and when the money has arrived. You can do so with a block explorer. Small businesses should also appreciate the lack of chargebacks with crypto transactions, in contrast with traditional payment methods.

Profitable Saving, Accessible Credit

If you join the crypto space in search of a better store of value than what the fiat system offers for your money, it’s worth noting that by design cryptocurrencies don’t suffer from significant inflation. Digital assets based on the original principles of Bitcoin have a limited supply, setting them apart from fiat currencies, which can be constantly inflated when governments create more money through quantitative easing or by manipulating benchmark interest rates. Historically, long term investments in many major cryptos have appreciated.

Using peer-to-peer digital cash does not require involvement of third parties, which is another strong point. Everyone is free to transact directly with anybody else. But if you need specialized financial services, a thriving ecosystem growing around cryptocurrencies can provide you with such. Platforms like Cred, for instance, let you earn up to 10% interest on your BTC and BCH holdings, much more than any regular savings account these days, or get a sub-10% APR crypto-backed loan without the credit checks and hidden fees employed by banks and credit card companies.

In a tweet published on Nov. 22, Hoskinson urged the cryptocurrency community that Bitcoin is more than speculation, putting the blame on the latest drop in price on news media “FUD” — or fear, uncertainty and doubt — and market manipulation.

A global movement

Because there’s more to Bitcoin than just price movements, he expects the world’s biggest cryptocurrency to see more gains in the future. He said:

“Bitcoin's price is going down? Remember everyone, after the FUD, news trading and manipulation clears out, we still have a global movement that's going to change the world. We will see 10k btc again and welcome 100k. Crypto is unstoppable. Crypto is the future.”

Bitcoin’s recent price action

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin and altcoins have seen a notable price decrease yesterday. More precisely, Bitcoin briefly dipped below $7,000 before settling slightly higher.

Still, as Cointelegraph’s market analysis pointed out, Bitcoin dominance is up for the week at 69%, meaning that BTC has once again outperformed other cryptocurrencies during the despite its decline this week.

Shortly after the price drop, Bitcoin futures daily volumes on digital asset platform Bakkt have hit a new all-time high, showing an increased interest in capitalizing on the renewed volatility.

In October, Hoskinson also expressed the idea that if Bitcoin fails, the entire cryptocurrency industry could fail.","This week saw personal data and passwords of GateHub wallet users leaked online, as well as discussions about 80,000 Bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox. We learned that BTC may dip below USD 7K before the halving (and it did), and miners may or may not be capitulating. Meanwhile, Ethereum managed an ‘insane’ number of transfers on its network and the real dapp transaction volume might be several times bigger than thought, several hundred XRP accounts have been linked to ""dirty"" USD 400 million, BCH was shortly the only top 10 coin in green likely boosted by the launch of a USD 200 million fund, Grin crashed on arguments over Mimblewimble’s privacy model, and multi-collateral Dai went live.

While we’re discussing what regulators may bring next year and in the next decade, now there are more than 6,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the world and the taxman is paying attention. As major exchanges drop on the ‘most trusted’ list, Binance ignored the talk of crypto ban in India and acquired WazirX, the Royal Bank of Canada has no plans to launch a crypto exchange, and Japan won’t be launching a digital yen soon. Meanwhile, Canaan failed to raise USD 100 million, China registered 60% of the world’s blockchain patents, South Korea’s biggest businesses continue to dominate the nation’s blockchain industry, thieves robbed a BTC ATM, and as a solution to all traditional-banking issues, the Cryptoworld votes ‘BTC’.

And now, here is your weekly dose of crypto jokes. Enjoy!

And you can think about your next move.","Chinese authorities shut down local cryptocurrency exchange BISS and arrested 10 people suspected of being involved in its operations.

Local media Sohu reported on the actions undertaken by Chinese authorities on Nov. 22. However, the date at which the event itself took place is unclear.

The same day, founding partner of blockchain-based investment company Primitive Ventures Dovey Wan said on Twitter that the local cryptocurrency community had known of the development for two weeks. However, the news was published much later. She also claimed that the Beijing-based exchange in question is noteworthy:

“It’s a relatively known up-and-rising exchange.”

In a blog post published on Nov. 18, the exchange addressed user withdrawal issues. The firm also confirmed that Chinese authorities have halted operations:

“According to market sources, it is understood that BISS’ operations have been halted following an enquiry by China’s regulatory authorities around its services offered to users, which may not be aligned with capital controls regulations in China.”

The company claimed in the announcement that operations had halted while the authorities looked into the case to safeguard user interests. Lastly, the exchange also noted that it intends to cooperate fully with Chinese law enforcement.

China’s crackdown on local crypto exchanges

As Cointelegraph reported last week, Shenzhen authorities identified a total of 39 exchanges falling afoul of China’s cryptocurrency trading ban.

Furthermore, the Chinese technology capital of Shenzhen recently issued a warning against illegal activities involving cryptocurrencies, including cryptocurrency exchanges.","What’s an effective way to diversify a crypto portfolio? Are crypto assets able to be diversified at all? These are the questions that many “Hodlers” have been asking. The slow bleed of Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies prices has been challenging investors and their holding powers. Despite BTC still able to maintain its 112% year-to-date gains so far — thanks to the massive bull run in the second quarter and the recent China-inspired rally — the recent price correction could pressure some of the latecomers. In this article, we will study some possible diversification options for crypto portfolios from a Hodler’s perspective — i.e., diversifying investment by allocating capital into various crypto assets using long-only strategies. We will also explore how altcoins and stablecoins could balance a portfolio.

Why diversify?

In the traditional world of finance, the performance of different assets could vary under different market conditions. For example, real estate investment trusts could outperform general equities in a turbulence market, and defensive stocks could disappoint investors when the appetite for risk is heightened. That’s when diversification comes in. The main purpose of exposure to different asset classes is to balance risk and return in a portfolio.

In the cryptocurrency space, diversification could also be one of the ways to manage risk exposure. However, some would argue that it is impossible to diversify a crypto portfolio due to the fact that major altcoins are highly correlated with Bitcoin. However, with a carefully selected basket of altcoins — in conjunction with stablecoins — investors could able to navigate the market more effectively with manageable risk.

Concentration vs. diversification

There has always been a debate about putting all your eggs in one basket. While in some cases concentrating on only one asset could maximize profitability, this also maximizes the risk exposure. On top of that, a heavy-concentration strategy gives investors no room for any errors in analysis, and it overexposes the investor to unnecessary risks.

However, over-diversification could also hurt investment returns. Some investors believe that the more assets they own, the better return they can have — and that’s not the right concept. It could increase investment cost, add unnecessary due-diligence efforts and lead to below-average risk-adjusted returns.

Market performance overview

Before getting into portfolio diversification, let’s have a quick recap on the performance of major cryptocurrencies. The figure below shows that OKB and BTC were among some of the YTD gainers, while XMR and XRP have been underperforming compared to their peers. Once again, this shows various crypto assets could perform very differently, highlighting the importance of balancing risk and return.

Asset allocation

A portfolio with a balanced selection of coins and tokens could help Hodlers balance risk and returns. Here are some sample portfolios using BTC alongside other leading altcoins as well as the Fundstrat Crypto 40 Index — a weighted index tracks the top 11 to 50 cryptocurrencies by market value and liquidity. The results could make Hodlers think again about putting all their eggs in one basket.

Many BTC-based portfolios have remained solidly in the green, due in part to Bitcoin holding on to its 112% gain so far this year. As shown above, however, the portfolio containing only BTC and Ether (ETH) has been underperformed compared to portfolios that have both BTC and exposure to mid-cap altcoins. To see this, compare the 50/50 portfolio (with a yearly gain of 67%) to the one consisting of Bitcoin and the top-40 index (gaining 77% on the year).

Meanwhile, the hedging nature of stablecoins like Tether (USDT) has been reflected in the sample portfolio based on BTC and the index with a hedge (76%). In this diversification example, the exposure to altcoins is reduced, the BTC holdings are slightly increased and USDT was added. Still, the gain of this portfolio was very close to the one without USDT. In general, a portfolio that includes stablecoins can reduce the risk ratio more than one that is unhedged, but as the examples above show, it is still possible to achieve similar results.

Stablecoins are especially important in portfolios that include highly volatile coins and tokens, as can be seen in the example of the hedged basket. The group comprises XLM and OKB, which have plummeted over 46% and surged over 290% respectively. Still, this combination was able to achieve almost 80% YTD gains, and the USDT holdings were part of the reason behind that performance. In contrast, the mixture of BTC and certain altcoins without a stablecoin in the basket could underperform the other sample portfolios provided.

Advanced setup

Additionally, experienced traders and Hodlers are able to fine-tune their portfolios by adding derivatives on top of a long-only portfolio. For example, if a Hodler is being short-term bullish on an individual coin, he can increase his leverage on that specific coin by adding futures or perpetual swap positions on top of the holdings. Structured products can also be used as a hedge in a downturning market.

Crypto asset diversification has been one of the most debated topics in the industry. Some would argue that a 100% Bitcoin allocation setup could probably still able to generate a decent return this year. However, a BTC-only portfolio will never able to capture the distinctive opportunities in the altcoin world, which could potentially generate higher returns — and, of course, putting all your eggs in one basket comes with higher risk. A carefully designed portfolio with balanced asset allocation could maximize the risk-adjusted return. As the year-end approaches, investors and Hodlers can review their risk profiles and adjust their strategies for next year.

This week, Crypto Capital analyst Fred Marion shares three reasons why cryptos could go from the fringes of society into the mainstream in 2020. Steve is cautious when it comes to cryptos, but he's always looking for moneymaking opportunities to share with DailyWealth readers. So if you're interested in crypto investing, you must read this essay...

The first time I bought bitcoin, it took a week...

I spent two days setting up the necessary software on my computer. Then, after filling out all the required forms, I had to take the printouts to a nearby drugstore. At the store, I called a number in California from a red, ancient-looking MoneyGram phone.

The woman on the other end read me a code over the crackly line. I took that code to the cash register, along with my paperwork and cash... Finally, a few anxiety-filled days later, the money transfer cleared my bank and a tiny bit of bitcoin showed up in my crypto wallet.

Looking back, I wish I bought more... Bitcoin is up roughly 32 times since my first purchase.

Meanwhile, since that day in 2013, the crypto landscape has transformed dramatically...

Now, you can buy bitcoin in about five minutes with resources like Square's Cash App and Coinbase's debit card purchases. You don't even need to leave your own home.

And of course, the crypto industry has evolved to include many more options... Bitcoin is one of more than 6,000 cryptos you can actively buy and sell with the right tools today.

Also, ""blockchain developer"" is one of the fastest-growing job categories on the planet...

In February, a report from job-search website Hired showed that demand for software engineers with blockchain-development skills grew by more than 500% over the past year. And as the website noted in its report, this demand isn't going to disappear anytime soon...

There was an explosion of demand in the past 12 months for developers with blockchain skills and we expect demand to continue growing as businesses begin implementing its countless use cases, from digital identity and smart contracts to workforce management and distributed data storage.

But even though we've seen such incredible growth in the crypto space over the past several years, we've only laid the groundwork for what's to come. And as I'll explain today, 2020 could make the past decade of blockchain development look like child's play...

""Can you buy anything with it?""

That's one of the first questions most people ask me about bitcoin. I point to a few websites that accept it – like Overstock.com, for example – but that doesn't impress anyone.

Even though it's easier than ever to trade cryptos, they still haven't gone mainstream. I'm sure a lot of DailyWealth readers have heard of bitcoin... But how many of you actually own any?

That could soon change in a big way...

You see, in the first half of next year, Bakkt – a digital-assets startup that's backed by Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange – plans to test a bitcoin merchant network. Coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX) will be its first launch partner.

In other words, if everything plays out as expected, many folks in the U.S. should be able to walk into the nearest Starbucks just months from now and buy an espresso with bitcoin.

While we don't know all the details yet, we know around 75 million customers visit Starbucks each month. Exposing so many folks to bitcoin as a payment option would be the biggest public relations boon in crypto's history. It could change perceptions of bitcoin overnight.

The act of training Starbucks' more than 180,000 U.S. employees on processing bitcoin transactions is big in and of itself. I look at it like a mandatory bitcoin education program... one that will generate countless coffee-shop conversations.

I expect bitcoin payments to become popular at Starbucks, especially among millennials...

Millennials are digital natives, after all – a generation that came of age with the Internet. They trust bits and bytes in a way that older generations struggle to comprehend.

Consider this... According to a survey published earlier this year by investment platform eToro, 43% of millennial online traders trust cryptocurrency exchanges more than they do the U.S. stock market.

Based on an online survey conducted this spring, meanwhile, Americans ages 18 to 34 are four times more likely to own bitcoin than those ages 45 to 64, and 10 times more likely than folks 65 and older. Younger folks view money through a different lens...

For them, it's not something you entrust to the government. It's something you entrust to the inalienable laws of mathematics and computer code. And nearly 30% of them would rather hold bitcoin than bonds or stocks.

Some millennials trust bitcoin so much more than the U.S. dollar that they've given the dollar a nickname... ""boomer bucks."" The idea of carrying around cash is just quaint to many millennials.

But in 2020, we could see something bigger than Starbucks' entrance into the crypto world...

As I explained in the November 15 DailyWealth, social media giant Facebook (FB) officially unveiled its own crypto – called ""libra"" – earlier this year. It's not a bitcoin clone...

Instead, Facebook and its roughly 20 partners in the so-called Libra Association seek to create a form of money with a stable value – what's known in the crypto industry as a ""stablecoin.""

Today, most stablecoins are pegged to national currencies...

For example, crypto token Tether – which trades in the crypto universe under the symbol ""USDT"" – launched in 2014 with the goal of maintaining a 1-to-1 ratio with the U.S. dollar. That means 1 USDT should always be worth $1. To maintain that peg, Tether Limited – the token's creator – aims to back every USDT it issues with a fiat dollar in a bank account.

That's where libra will be different... Rather than being backed by the U.S. dollar alone, libra will be backed by several countries' currencies, as well as sovereign bonds.

Since its launch in 2014, Tether has grown into a behemoth. Its trading volumes often exceed even bitcoin's. Some $20 billion of Tether change hands every day, much of it moving capital between China – with its strict capital controls – and the rest of the world.

While I was attending Vegas Blockchain Week last month, libra came up in conversation...

A prominent entrepreneur in the space described libra as ""crypto's punching bag.""

It's the first high-profile project to take the full brunt of the U.S. government's anger over the birth of cryptocurrencies. Essentially – and I'm paraphrasing here – the entrepreneur said this about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the U.S. government...

He didn't just poke the bear. He stripped off all his clothes, slathered honey all over his body, climbed into the cave, and grabbed the bear's newborn cubs.

From almost the moment libra was announced, you got the sense that regulators and lawmakers smelled blood...

First, they called David Marcus, Facebook's crypto chief, before U.S. congressional committees. They wanted the company's commitment that it wouldn't release libra before new regulations were put in place.

""I committed to waiting for us to have all the appropriate regulatory approvals and have addressed all concerns before moving forward,"" Marcus responded.

That wasn't good enough... So government officials summoned Zuckerberg to Capitol Hill for six hours of excruciating hearings.

This wasn't testimony so much as verbal abuse. And it sets a dangerous precedent... the idea that entrepreneurs must go to Washington and beg for permission to innovate.

There's a reason why Washington is nervous, though...

Facebook's user base is staggering. Between the company's four products – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger – it has 2.8 billion monthly users worldwide.

To put that in perspective, only around 356 million people – everyone living in the U.S. and a handful of other territories and countries, including Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Ecuador, and Zimbabwe – use the U.S. dollar as at least one of their official currencies.

If libra launches next year, it could become one of the world's largest currencies overnight.

And even if it doesn't happen in 2020, I believe libra will launch at some point.

Despite the regulatory outcry – and the departure of some of the Libra Association's high-profile partners, including financial-services companies Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), and PayPal (PYPL) – the opportunity is too big for it not to happen... even if it takes until 2021.

And another wild card could make an even bigger impact than libra in 2020...

I'm talking about the world's most populated country – China.

You see, while Facebook's potential entrance into the crypto industry continues to meet opposition both here in the U.S. and abroad, China is taking things into its own hands...

In a speech in late October, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country intends to ""take the leading position in the emerging field of blockchain."" And he noted that the country will increase investments to make it happen. Bitcoin prices rocketed 40% higher on the news.

But Xi wasn't endorsing bitcoin so much as setting the table for the release of China's own digital currency. And it could be coming sooner rather than later...

The Chinese government has been working on a digital currency since 2014. And it's ""almost ready,"" a senior official at the country's central bank said in August.

China is playing 3D chess while the rest of the world is playing checkers...

""They already have all the systems and the network ready,"" Jack Lee, managing partner of HCM Capital, told financial news network CNBC earlier this month. ""I think you will see it very soon, in the next maybe two to three months.""

Today, the dollar reigns supreme as the global reserve currency. It's an exorbitant privilege for the U.S... one that has allowed us to run massive trade deficits for decades with few to no repercussions. But if the Chinese yuan is suddenly cheaper, faster, and easier to use thanks to nearly instantaneous settlements, nothing will stop the world from switching.

Old habits die hard... But they die quickly if it means more money in people's pockets.

Facebook's libra and China's looming digital currency both share a major problem, though...

As far as we know, they'll both be backed by the same fiat currencies we use today. That means they will also ultimately inherit the biggest problem with fiat money... inflation.

Meanwhile, bitcoin was designed to be the hardest form of money in history...

Eventually, the world will have 21 million bitcoin... and no more. That's the way bitcoin's founder – an individual (or group) known as Satoshi Nakamoto – programmed the network when bitcoin was first released in 2009. There will never be a 21,000,001st bitcoin.

It's such a finitely scarce asset that it's hard to even conceptualize what it means...

If everyone in the world got an equal number of bitcoin, we would each have less than 0.003 bitcoin (about $22 worth at today's prices). If we only gave out bitcoin to millionaires, the 14 million of them in the world today would each get roughly 1.5 bitcoin (about $11,000 worth).

That radical scarcity is one of the reasons many people refer to bitcoin as ""digital gold."" It's a place for investors to store their wealth where it can't be watered down by bureaucrats.

So what does all this mean?

In 2020, we'll finally see people spending bitcoin to buy coffee. And we'll see corporations and governments embracing cryptos – from Facebook's libra to China's digital currency.

Bitcoin will finally go from the fringes of society into the mainstream.

In June, a survey from Statista showed just how far we have to go... The market-research firm polled roughly 1,000 people in each participating country to find out how global consumers think. The following chart shows respondents' familiarity with cryptocurrencies...

As you can see, Turkey leads the way with about one in five of the poll participants from the country saying they own crypto. The depreciation of the country's fiat currency – the lira – has resulted in the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies over the past several years.

But here in the U.S., only 5% of the Statista survey's respondents – all Internet users between ages 18 and 64 – said they have owned cryptocurrencies. That's a lot of potential market share before you even leave our country.

Bitcoin's market cap remains small... It's still only about $150 billion today. Many U.S.-listed stocks are bigger than that.

And bitcoin's supply is limited... We'll never have more than 21 million, as we said. So if a lot of people from just one country start pouring money into the space, its price could rocket higher.

In fact, it could go much higher than almost anyone can imagine today...

Though it likely won't be a straight move up, bitcoin is becoming more accepted every day.

You no longer need to spend a week jumping through hoops – installing hard-to-understand software, talking to someone on a beat-up phone while standing in the corner of a drugstore, and then waiting impatiently for days – just to buy a small number of bitcoin.

We're seeing it with Starbucks... We're seeing it with libra... And we're seeing it with China.

My colleague and Crypto Capital editor Eric Wade believes bitcoin will soar to $1 million in our lifetimes. That's more than 13,000% higher than today's price (about $7,500).

While I'm excited about bitcoin's prospects, it isn't the biggest opportunity in the crypto space right now...

Earlier this week, Dr. Ron Paul – the 12-term U.S. congressman and three-time presidential candidate – joined Eric for a special crypto-focused event.

They gave attendees a behind-the-scenes look at what's happening in the crypto space right now. And more important, Eric revealed all the details about the ""next bitcoin""...

This tiny crypto currently trades for less than one penny. Yet Eric believes it will ultimately change the way you – and millions of Americans – do business in dozens of different ways.

It could be even bigger than buying bitcoin for $0.05 back in 2010... If you invest just $100 in this crypto at today's prices, you'll be up more than $500,000 if it climbs to $50.

If you missed the event, that's OK. The good news is, it's not too late to get all the details...

You see, for the next few days, we're offering a free replay of the event. We want to make sure as many folks as possible have the opportunity to hear from Eric and Dr. Paul. Watch the replay right here.

Good investing,

Fred Marion

Editor's note: During this week's event, Eric shared all the details about an incredible buying opportunity in the crypto space. He said it's like ""going back in time and buying bitcoin for a nickel back in 2010."" Eric believes this crypto will be on the tips of everyone's tongues in 2020... yet it trades for less than a penny today. Get all the details right here.","Localethereum Becomes Localcryptos and Adds BTC Trading

P2P trading site Localethereum has rebranded to Localcryptos, allowing users to buy and sell both ETH and BTC without KYC. The platform has been providing peer to peer trading services for ethereum since 2017, but in a surprise announcement this week, the website revealed its new home, localcryptos.com and rolled out its P2P trading service and fiat onramp to bitcoin users. Visitors to Localethereum will now find themselves redirected to the new multi-currency site, in a move which will give rival P2P exchange Localbitcoins (LBC) pause for thought.

Bitcoin Traders Can Avoid KYC On Former Ethereum-Only Market

Localcryptos is painting a target on the back of Localbitcoins, placing itself in direct competition not only by offering BTC trades, but by making it possible for users to import their reputation score from one site to the other. The platform announced: “When you join LocalCryptos, you can bring your profile reputation from LocalBitcoins. That way, you can keep your hard-earned reputation — you don’t need to start over.”

By making it as simple as possible for LBC users to carry over their positive reputation, Localcryptos has fired the first shots in a new battlefront for the P2P exchange marketplace. Localcryptos also elaborated on what it considers to be a number of issues with the long running BTC onramp, of which security was at the top of the list. Localcryptos did not hold back on its criticisms of the longstanding exchange, writing: “LocalBitcoins looks the same today as it did in 2012, and there’s plenty wrong with it. Platforms like LocalBitcoins are centralized, custodial, and a far cry from private.”

By comparison, Localcryptos is a non-custodial service where users retain their private keys, an advantage which will be welcomed by traders who are well aware of the fairly regular hacks and security breaches that centralized services fall foul of. The system in place on Localcryptos is similar to P2P bitcoin cash marketplace local.Bitcoin.com which launched earlier this year.

The escrow feature on Localcryptos is noncustodial, using ethereum smart contracts for ETH trades and P2WSH for bitcoin, so whatever crypto you’re trading, the funds are never held on a centralized server at any point. For anyone interested in exactly how the decentralized bitcoin escrow service is achieved, Localcryptos goes into the nuts and bolts here.

Bitcoin and Beyond

As well as rolling out its service to bitcoiners, Localcryptos intends to extend its P2P trading service to other ERC20 tokens over time, and eventually plans to tackle non-fungible ERC721 tokens as well. P2P exchanges have often labored with low trade volumes and liquidity, an issue which news.Bitcoin.com recently covered in a report on decentralized exchange Bisq. If Localcryptos spreads itself too thin across too many tokens, there’s the potential for liquidity issues to surface.

At present, however, with 100,000 users worldwide and 1,000 active users on any given day completing 200 trades, Localcryptos looks set to create another valuable decentralized gateway for BTC with minimal or no KYC. Coupled with the BCH marketplace available at local.Bitcoin.com, and bitcoiners bemoaning the loss of LBC have new platforms to turn to at last.

2019-11-24,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of the most divisive cryptocurrencies in the market, with supporters claiming it is about to stage a comeback and critics arguing the asset will be dead within a couple of years.

Apart from one spectacular surge during April 2018, Bitcoin Cash’s performance has been pretty lacklustre since its creation in the summer of 2017.

Some analysts think we’re in line for more of the same next year, whereas others suggest its winning features could propel the price to as high as $6,000 – up from just $265 today.

What is Bitcoin Cash?

Before we explore the arguments for and against a Bitcoin Cash bull run, it’s worth taking a brief look back at its history. Although Bitcoin Cash was created just two-and-a-half years ago, it has managed to achieve a market cap of $4.8 billion, making it the fourth-biggest cryptocurrency in the market today.

The coin is a fork of Bitcoin and was created in response to the challenges surrounding Bitcoin’s scalability and high transaction fees. Bitcoin Cash’s creators essentially wanted to create a cryptocurrency that was as close as possible to a digital version of cash.

Bitcoin Cash itself forked in August 2018 as a result of infighting among the development team. This resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision and Bitcoin ABC. The latter continues to be recognised as Bitcoin Cash.

Price history

Bitcoin Cash achieved its all-time high in December 2017 when it soared to $4,356 in parallel with the Bitcoin boom. Since then, it has generally been on a downward spiral, apart from one surge in April-May 2018 when it rose from $643 to $1,766.

Its 2019 peak came at the end of June when it reached $486, but it has subsequently dropped by 45% to $265.

The case for a Bitcoin Cash bull run

Optimists believe Bitcoin Cash has such appealing characteristics that a bull run is inevitable. The main advantage of Bitcoin Cash is it enables cheap and fast transactions. Online businesses can integrate it into their systems relatively easily, which means many retailers around the world now accept it.

Bitcoin Cash can process a higher number of transactions per second than Bitcoin, and its transaction fee is around $0.125 compared with Bitcoin’s $1.31. Bitcoin Cash is more lucrative for miners than Bitcoin is, which some experts suggest could encourage more miners to switch to Bitcoin Cash and fuel its growth.

There are lots of positive developments when it comes to Bitcoin Cash’s adoption. AT&T, one of the world’s largest telecoms giants and a top-10 Fortune 500 company, now lets users pay in Bitcoin Cash for their bills through BitPay.

The brewery Brewdog is offering shares in its company in exchange for cryptocurrency including Bitcoin Cash, while BCH is now accepted by more shops and businesses in Venezuela than the original Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

There have also been positive moves in the wider financial market. Bitcoin.com announced in September that it is seeking to launch a Bitcoin Cash futures product on a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated exchange as part of an attempt to ramp up interest in the asset.

In the same week, fintech company Amun announced the listing of a Bitcoin Cash exchange-traded product on the Switzerland-based stock exchange Six.

The case against a Bitcoin Cash bull run

Critics argue that Bitcoin Cash is essentially redundant. The coin has neither reduced Bitcoin’s prominence nor created a secondary market for which it is uniquely suited. Bitcoin itself has become fast and affordable, which undermines Bitcoin Cash’s USP.

RT anchor Max Keiser wrote a tweet in August in which he described Bitcoin Cash as “a wounded, volatile animal”, adding: “A year from now it will struggle to stay above $100. The project was DOA from day one. 90% of its market cap is the product of manipulation that will be impossible to meaningfully sustain.”

On top of all this, it’s impossible to shy away from the fact that despite the many positive Bitcoin Cash developments we’ve witnessed, not one has managed to make a long-lasting impact on its price.

Conclusion

Bitcoin Cash is certainly making headway when it comes to adoption, but its weak performance in comparison with Bitcoin can’t be ignored.

If you’re a pessimist, 2020 is likely to bring more of the same. If you’re an optimist, Bitcoin Cash has lots of room for recovery, and it’s possible that its wider adoption could spur a much-needed rally. All we can say for now is: watch this space.","Why did this happen?

From a potential Bitcoin roadblock to a new milestone on the Ethereum network, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin

A veteran technical trader who became a crypto legend for calling Bitcoin’s epic crash in January of 2018 says he remains convinced that BTC will smash through its all-time high and hit $50,000.

But before the next big surge, Peter Brandt says he’s looking for an extinction – “when no [Bitcoin] bulls can be found on Twitter.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Once the bulls have lost their enthusiasm and all weak hands have sold their BTC, Brandt believes the leading cryptocurrency can begin a true turnaround.

Brandt says he’s already a buyer in the current crypto market. He thinks BTC will likely hit a bottom at around $5,500 with BTC’s long-term parabolic trajectory in peril if BTC touches $2,800.

“I will only be a buyer from this point forward. It would take a break of 2800 for me to capitulate.

My target of $5,500 is not far below today’s low. But I think the surprise might be in the duration and nature of market. I am thinking about a low in July 2020. That will wear out bulls quicker than a price correction.”

Ethereum

The decentralized finance (DeFi) movement just hit a new milestone.

DeFi is designed to replace traditional financial instruments with a decentralized alternative that’s not controlled by corporations or governments.

ADVERTISEMENT

A new all-time high of over 2.63 million ETH worth $394.2 million is now locked in Ethereum-based DeFi contracts, according to the data tracker DeFi Pulse.

The majority is stored in the collateralized loan platform Maker, which has 2.0 million worth $301 million ETH locked up.

Ripple and XRP

Ripple is expanding its operation in Dubai.

The company is looking to hire a technical services engineer who will “analyze and resolve challenging technical issues, and investigate and identify root causes at the product, data, or network level, all the while keeping key stakeholders informed and up to date on the situation.”

Ripple currently has 52 open positions, including five engineers who will work on Ripple’s Xpring, which recently released an SDK designed to help developers build on the XRP Ledger.

Litecoin

Litecoin Foundation director Franklyn Richards says plans to add confidential transactions to LTC are more about fungibility than privacy.

ADVERTISEMENT

In a new rebuttal to a takedown on privacy protocol Mimblewimble, Richards says the Foundation’s focus is on ensuring that the transaction history of a particular Litecoin does not affect its value.

“The main appeal of MW and the reason the Litecoin Core team are looking to implement support for it, has primarily been its ability to provide network fungibility, future scalability and ‘greater’ (not complete) privacy.

Fungibility is derived from the inclusion of confidential transactions (CT) whereby the value sent over the network is hidden yet verifiable. This means when interacting with other people on the network they won’t be able to look back and know how much Litecoin you own.”

A cryptocurrency whale has just moved a ball-busting 44,000 BTC (worth more than $310 million) — and they paid a minuscule $0.32 in Bitcoin transaction fees to do so.

The hefty movement was detected by Twitter-based transaction monitor @whale_alert this afternoon. Bitcoin’s miners included it in block #605230.

🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 44,000 #BTC (310,280,282 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet Tx: https://t.co/GgIfMr9eMy — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 24, 2019

According to Blockchain.com’s Bitcoin explorer, the fee paid was just 0.00004551 BTC ($0.32). This is incredibly low, especially when compared to large movements previously detected.

It’s even more impressive when you consider that whoever sent the Bitcoin had no need to request permission from any bank, financial regulator, or world government to send hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital cash.

Unlike the traditional banking system, Bitcoin users are afforded the freedom to choose their own transaction fees.

Transactions with higher fees attached are generally processed quicker than those with smaller ones.

In July, one Bitcoin whale moved $450 million multiple times, paying roughly $400 in fees for each transaction.

As well, Hard Fork reported that another big player had shifted $1 billion worth of Bitcoin in September. They paid $700 in fees to the network.

Have the whales figured out they’ve been overpaying?","Cryptocurrency institutional investors overwhelmingly keep their wealth on exchanges despite the inherent security risks, new data claims.

Compiled by cryptocurrency exchange Binance on Nov. 22, a survey asked 76 institutional investors who used its platform about their trading habits.

Exchange storage “most popular choice”

The survey was part of Binance’s Institutional Market Insights research, which is now in its second edition.

Among the most surprising results was that 92% of participants chose to keep their crypto — Bitcoin (BTC), stablecoins and others — with trusted third parties, and not under their own control.

The figure dwarfs much safer alternatives such as hardware wallets and other cold wallets.

“Exchanges remain as the most popular choice for cryptoasset storage amongst our institutional and VIP clients at 92.1%,” Binance summarized. Researchers added:

“When moving to self-storage, cold wallets are the second most favored choice, given their improved safety and control. Third-party custody services were the least popular option at 2.6%.”

The 76 investors cannot be said to have significant exposure in terms of capital — over 50% had total crypto holdings of under 10 units of a coin. 10 BTC currently equals around $72,000.

Demands to take back control of crypto

As Cointelegraph reported, investors face significantly increased risk of loss and theft of coins if they remain in wallets to which they do not control the private keys.

Exchanges, including Binance, continue to see hacks this year, while regulatory scrutiny can also see funds locked up without notice until an account owner provides personal identity data.

Efforts to make investors aware of the need to control their money are mounting. On Jan. 3, the second annual Proof of Keys event will challenge all Bitcoin holders to remove their funds from third-party wallets.

The brainchild of advocate Trace Mayer, preparations for the move, which coincides with the anniversary of the Bitcoin genesis block, are already a common sight on social media.","It seems like it's almost every month that a new exchange launches in the cryptocurrency market.

Over the last year, a number of new crypto marketplaces have come online including derivatives players like CoinFLEX and institutional-aimed venues like AAX in the United Kingdom. In the last few months, The Block data shows that legitimate trading volumes on spot crypto exchanges is down more than 50% since June.

The increase in competition and decline in volumes might seem like the perfect recipe for consolidation, but Max Boonen, the chief executive officer of over-the-counter trading firm B2C2 says that is not the case.

""I used to think they would consolidate, but I don't think so,"" he said on a recent episode of The Scoop.

He noted two reasons. First, he said the 2017 boom provided many exchanges with a solid war chest to stay in business and compete. At the same time, captive user-bases keep clients trading on various platform.

""I mean, Kraken and Coinbase all of those guys are doing healthy volumes and some of them managed to have a somewhat captive user-base.""

Boonen added that newcomers that offer a new kind of user experience have also seen a significant growth:

""And you see that with a lot of the newcomers, right? Binance. Incredible success story. How long did it take for Binance to really take off? Less than six months. There's a few new exchanges, CoinFlex, FTX, those guys in a few months have really taken market share.""

He thinks that the market structure of crypto will look like FX in which there will be many brokers to choose from.

""You know, you have dozens of FX Brokers that you can pick from, obviously some bigger than others. But it's possible that we're just never going to have consolidation or it's going to be at the margin. It's not necessarily going to be, you know, exchanges dying left and right.""","Coming every Sunday, Hodler’s Digest will help you track every single important news story that happened this week.

Top Stories This Week

Heads were turned this week when reports suggested that Binance and Bithumb, two major crypto exchanges, have closed their offices in Shanghai following raids by Chinese police. However, not everything is as it seems, with both companies claiming that the rumors aren’t true. Binance has said such a police operation would actually be impossible because it doesn’t have offices in the city, while Bithumb insisted that its Shanghai team is continuing to operate “steadily without pause.” A spokesperson for Binance told Cointelegraph that the company has been subject to a spate of negative articles in the Chinese media — and urged journalists to check whether their sources are telling the truth. On Saturday, CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ for short) went one further and vowed to sue The Block, accusing the industry media outlet of false reporting.

Despite the robust denials from Binance and Bithumb, China is keeping a watchful eye on crypto exchanges that are operating illegally in the city of Shenzhen. Authorities there have reportedly identified 39 platforms that have fallen afoul of the country’s trading ban — however, it’s unclear what consequences these businesses would face. Some analysts have claimed this crackdown will mainly focus on Ponzi schemes and crypto frauds, with PrimitiveCrypto founding partner Dovey Wan claiming that Shenzhen has become a “hub” for such companies. Indeed, CZ has actually welcomed China’s stance, telling Wan: “This is actually a very good thing to happen, cleaning up the industry of scammers and fraudsters.”

After facing a slow grind down to $8,000 in recent days, BTC/USD finally succumbed to bearish pressure and fell into the low $7,000s — the levels seen prior to Bitcoin’s 42% price rise on Oct. 25. It is believed that the rumored Binance raid in China was a contributing factor towards the precipitous drop. Altcoins weren’t immune from the bloodbath in the crypto markets either, with some showing losses close to 10% on Friday. In response to BTC’s lackluster performance, crypto analyst and Cointelegraph contributor Flib Flib said: “Probability would suggest BTC/USD will need to spend a little more time testing below $7,000 before there is a significant bullish reversal.” The week’s turbulence had another painful consequence: the overall cryptocurrency market cap fell below $200 billion for a time.

In happier news, Binance has announced that it has acquired the well-known Indian exchange WazirX. It is hoped that the move will make access to crypto easier for a population of more than one billion people. The takeover means users will be able to use rupees to buy and sell digital currencies — and it’s likely to prove a much-needed morale boost for the Indian crypto community given the government’s hardline approach. Local journalist Kashif Raza told Cointelegraph that WazirX’s decision to join forces with the industry giant was likely driven by the ongoing regulatory uncertainty, which has seen several exchanges shut their doors. For now, a proposed law that would result in a 10-year jail term for those who deal in cryptocurrencies has been put on ice, as the draft bill has not been introduced to parliament for the coming winter session.

Aaaand some slightly less happy news. The Bitcoin mining giant Canaan Creative only managed to raise $90 million in its initial public offering — over 75% less than what was expected. The company had failed to secure an IPO in Hong Kong last year, and subsequently shifted its attention to the U.S. as it pushed for a funding target of $400 million. Alas, Canaan suffered a major blow last week when it lost its banking partner Credit Suisse. The financial institution was reportedly concerned about whether the offering could secure sufficient orders, and the size of the IPO was subsequently slashed to $100 million. Despite the setback, this is the first Bitcoin mining giant to successfully navigate the choppy waters of an IPO — beating fellow rival Bitmain to the punch.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $7,256.72, Ether at $150.61 and XRP at $0.23. The total market cap is at $198,321,776,780.

The top three altcoin gainers of the week are EXMR, MMOCoin and Storeum. The top three altcoin losers of the week are MEXC Token, TRONCLASSIC and wys Token.

Most Memorable Quotations

“I think what they did was ridiculously stupid. The way they rolled it out… Yeah, you know it was just so… It was just so in your face.” David Rutter, R3 CEO

“The layoffs are a preemptive measure, meant to stave off the unexpected, including the possibility of an economic downturn [...] We think that acting now is best for the long-term health of the business.” Maddie Kennedy, Chainalysis director of communications

“Binance has no fixed offices in Shanghai or China, so it makes no sense that police raided on any offices and shut them down.” Binance, crypto exchange

“People from all over the world were buying Kings jerseys, tickets, different Kings gear. They were super excited that this team was accepting Bitcoin [...] We even put a Bitcoin ATM in the arena. Then the Bitcoin price went up to $1,200 and they quit spending the Bitcoin.” Ryan Montoya, Sacramento Kings chief technology officer

“We think there’s a lot of promise to blockchain technology. It’s intriguing to us, but it really needs to do something that the traditional rails can’t do.” Dan Schulman, PayPal CEO

“Bitcoin’s supply schedule initially hooked me, but Lightning was the force that was pulling me in [...] a store-of-value asset exhibiting medium-of-exchange currency speed and scale is unprecedented in human history, and worth pursuit.” Nik Bhatia, veteran Wall Street trader

“What we don’t want to do is take a heavy hand and snuff out innovation altogether,” Heath Tarbert, Chair of CFTC on crypto regulation

“When we saw [Facebook] talking about doing a basket of currencies with weighting, in reality when we want to translate that back to real-world currencies it’s not simple.[...] It’s really naïve.” David Rutter, R3 CEO

Prediction of the Week

In light of the Bitcoin beating this week, there’s been no shortage of crypto pundits offering their take on what’s going to happen next. The well-known statistician and crypto analyst Willy Woo thinks that BTC has almost reached rock bottom for 2019 — but warned that markets could yet sink as low as $4,500 before “the halvening” next May. Flib Flib, who we mentioned a little earlier, even said he is “totally back in cash” because the BTC slump is showing no obvious signs of reversal. Another respected analyst, Peter Brandt, also believes that Bitcoin prices will get worse before they get better — and revealed that he believes a floor of $5,500 may be possible. Brandt added: “I think the surprise might be in the duration and nature of the market.”

FUD of the Week

A federal jury in Manhattan has found Mark S. Scott guilty of helping OneCoin co-founder and current fugitive Ruja Ignatova launder $400 million. It is suspected that the lawyer was paid $50 million to help the so-called “cryptoqueen.” His defence lawyers had argued that he had no idea OneCoin was a scam and he was merely attempting to represent Ignatova’s interests, but the jury of six men and six women didn’t buy it. OneCoin is considered to be one of the crypto industry’s most famous exit scams — and despite allegations it raised $4.4 billion in a Ponzi scheme, the Bulgaria-based company remains operational. In other developments this week, it was reported that the brother of former U.S. President George W. Bush was paid $300,000 to attend a meeting involving Ignatova.

As skepticism surrounding Facebook’s Libra stablecoin continues to grow, one blockchain firm has opted to ridicule the embattled social network. R3 said the company’s decision to announce its foray into crypto over the summer was “ridiculously stupid” and “really naive.” Its CEO David Rutter said the tech giant was misguided in believing that it would be able to easily enter the financial systems world when other market participants have been working on such an ambition for years. Speaking in London, Rutter added: “The way they rolled it out… Yeah, you know it was just so... It was just so in your face. There’s a lack of understanding.”

It’s a story we’ve seen time and time again: thieves targeting a Bitcoin ATM. A couple of criminals in Canada decided to do just that this week — targeting the (tasty sounding) Simply Delicious Food Market in British Columbia. They managed to swipe $4,000, but in a rather epic blunder they forgot to check the second canister, where $50,000 was lying inside. Police were on the scene in 15 minutes, but the two men had escaped by then. Nonetheless, investigators appear confident that they will track the perpetrators down. The store owner says their getaway car was caught on camera, including the license plate.

There was a flurry of excitement earlier in November when a number of blockchain media outlets (yes, including us,) reported that Tunisia had become the first country to digitize its national currency on blockchain. But the news wasn’t true — with the central bank denying the claims. Stephen O’Neal dissects the dodgy rumors and explores how they spread.

London may be a prominent financial hub, but the U.K. has been left wanting by the lack of a concrete framework for the regulation of cryptocurrency. But now, the snappily named Jurisdiction Taskforce of the LawTech Delivery Panel has published a statement exploring their legal status. Henry Linver has more.

Cointelegraph has invited former blockchain tech leads at JPMorgan and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to explain the evolution of the financial institution’s blockchain products.

“It is business as usual,” Marius Reitz, head of Luno, told City Press’ sister publication, Rapport.

“We have arrangements with other banks in place, so deposits and withdrawals can still be done on the Luno platform.”

Luno is just one of the virtual currency exchanges that will be affected by FNB’s decision to shut down such accounts.

The bank services of other virtual exchanges, including VALR and ICE3X, and their intermediaries will expire at the end of March 2020.

Reitz said Luno clients with FNB accounts would not be affected until then, adding: “From the second quarter of 2020, FNB clients will still be able to deposit money in our other bank accounts.”

According to Reitz, Luno has established relationships with other banks in South Africa.

FNB has also assured individual clients that its decision will have no effect on them and is only applicable to trading platforms and intermediaries that trade in digital money.

“Our decision was made after we looked at the potential risks associated with these platforms, especially because they are not regulated at present,” said an FNB representative.

The bank did not elaborate on its reference to potential risks, but there is global concern that digital money – which can serve as a substitute for global currencies – can be used to finance terrorism, drug trafficking and assassinations, or for other nefarious purposes such as tax evasion and money laundering.

It is unclear whether other banks will follow FirstRand’s example.

Anna Isaac, head of compliance at Nedbank, said the bank was currently considering its position regarding digital trading platforms.

LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

Standard Bank spokesperson Ross Linstrom said the bank regularly engaged with its customers to understand their business models and policies on preventing terrorism and money laundering, as well as whether they were complying with legal requirements.

“We will continuously monitor these clients and developments in the industry,” he said.

At this point, Absa provides no services to digital exchanges.

“However,” said bank spokesperson Carli Cooke, “Absa’s clients who trade in digital money via their debit and credit cards are free to continue doing so.”

FNB’s decision is part of a wider international tendency to impose stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

The possession of, and trade in, digital currencies has already been banned in countries such as Ecuador, Bolivia, Egypt and Morocco, while Singapore and South Korea have begun to regulate it more strictly.

In Britain, Barclays ended its partnership with the US-based virtual currency exchange Coinbase in August.

And, earlier this year, India’s central bank banned financial institutions from providing banking services to cryptocurrency trading platforms.

In January, the SA Reserve Bank submitted a concept proposal detailing the future regulation of digital currencies. It would involve trading platforms registering with the Financial Intelligence Centre and reporting transactions in excess of R25 000, Netwerk24 reported.

The central bank could not be reached for comment on whether any progress had been made relating to the proposal.

Speaking on Radio 702’s programme, The Money Show, this week, Farzam Ehsani, co-founder and CEO of VALR, called FNB’s decision “a big disappointment”, especially since regulations had become more accommodating.

Ehsani, who was previously head of blockchain at FNB, said he struggled to understand why the bank would want to end services to the “most innovative industry in the last couple of decades”.",
2019-11-25,"What a tough month it has been for bitcoin.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency sank to $6,558.14 on Monday, its lowest level since May, according to industry site CoinDesk. It lost $3,000 in value in just a month as China accelerated a crackdown on businesses involved in cryptocurrency operations, a reversal from President Xi Jinping's previous signal to be more open to the blockchain technology. The coin last traded at $7,150.79.

Bitcoin jumped to above $10,000 briefly last month after Xi sang the praises of blockchain in a speech and called on his country to advance development in the field. However, on Friday, China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, pledged to continue to target exchanges and asked investors to be wary of digital currencies.

Beijing has taken a tough stance on cryptocurrencies, banning a fundraising exercise known as an initial coin offering and forcing local trading platforms to shut down in 2017.

""This was one of the worst weeks in the history of digital assets,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca, told CNBC. ""The market is clearly in contraction, with no new money coming in to soak up the supply.""

Still, bitcoin has doubled in price since the beginning of the year, marking a significant turnaround from last year, when the digital coin tanked to as low as $3,122. It got a boost this summer after Facebook announced its own planned libra cryptocurrency, which analysts say has contributed to positive sentiment around bitcoin and boosted its price.

Bitcoin has a history of strong comebacks from big sell-offs, Dorman noted. The cryptocurrency gained 70% in the four months following a 16% loss in 2016 and similarly an 89% gain in the four months after a 22% sell-off in 2015, Dorman said.

Bitcoin is nowhere near its all-time high, near $20,000 in December 2017.

— CNBC's Kate Rooney and Ryan Browne contributed to this report.","89% of China’s blockchain firms have allegedly tried to create their own cryptocurrency, according to a senior exec at a local blockchain association.

According to the state-run CCTV on Nov. 21, Yedong Zhu, the president of the Beijing Blockchain Technology Application Association (BBAA), revealed that the vast majority of blockchain industry in China is focused on tokens, not blockchain.

In addition to Zhu’s remarks, the report by CCTV covered a new study led by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC).

Co-authored by five local financial and technology authorities, the “Bluebook on Blockchain” report reveals that there are 28,000 blockchain enterprises in China.

The authors of the “bluebook” included the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Payment and Clearing Association of China, the Beijing Blockchain Technology Application Association and Social Sciences Academic Press.

BBAA president: 4,000 out of 28,000 Chinese DLT firms are focused on pure DLT

According to the BBAA president, only 4,000 Chinese blockchain companies are focused on pure blockchain technology, while as many as 25,000 have purportedly tried to issue their own cryptocurrency or token.

The news comes amidst the recently sparked Chinese push into blockchain technology development, which was triggered by President Xi Jinping’s call to embrace blockchain in October.

The push was accompanied by a renewed wave of pressure on local crypto-related businesses. On Nov. 21, the PBoC's Shanghai unit announced it was taking action against entities allegedly involved in trading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC). On Nov. 22, authorities in Shenzhen province claimed that 39 exchanges fell afoul of China’s cryptocurrency trading ban.

State-led publications have emphasized that the country’s blockchain push should be limited purely to blockchain technology, and not include cryptocurrency-related initiatives.

More than 50% of blockchain enterprises are located in Guangdong province

The majority of such companies are located in the Guangdong and Shenzhen provinces.

Additionally, the report claims that the scales of the “black industry” associated with online fraud in China has reached 100 billion Chinese yuan ($15.6 billion.)","Call it a self-defeating prophecy.

When President Xi Jinping praised blockchain technology as an opportunity that China should pounce on last month, many took it as an auspicious sign for the cryptocurrency market in the world’s second-largest economy.

This rosy interpretation led to the return of speculative fever surrounding not just major cryptocurrencies but also alleged crypto pump-and-dump schemes.

But that, in turn, has triggered another crackdown by local regulators, targeting exchanges, projects, media as well as blockchain and crypto-themed events – and dashing hopes for a crypto-friendly China.

After rallying as much as 30 percent within hours of Xi’s speech, the price of bitcoin has fallen back to a level even lower than it was before his remarks and dipped to a six-month low below $7,000 on Monday.

“I’ve called out countless time[s] already the initial pump is totally a[n] over-reaction, so a correction is well expected especially under the known CCP ‘carrot and stick’ strategy.” tweeted Dovey Wan, a founding partner at Primitive Ventures.

In what has become a defining episode of the clampdown, crypto news site The Block reported last week that Binance’s Shanghai office had shut down. The exchange’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, initially denied that it even had an office in Shanghai, and took umbrage at the publication’s claim there had been a “police raid.”

The Block later softened the phrase to “visit by authorities,” but sources told CoinDesk that Binance has indeed had a presence in Shanghai for some time.

Dragon Television, a Shanghai local broadcast station, aired in a program on Monday night China time that Binance’s Shanghai office was closed and added the office was used by outsourced customer service staff and some developers.

'Air coins'

The local community was briefly rejuvenated by the leader’s remarks.

From Nov. 8 to 9, more than 4,000 people attended the World Blockchain Conference in Wuzhen, China, according to the event organizer 8btc. Speakers included representatives from traditional tech firms like Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as well as those working in crypto exchanges, funds, projects and mining businesses.

Further supporting an optimistic outlook, a few days after Xi’s speech, the country’s top economic planning agency scrapped a proposal that would have recommended eliminating crypto mining from China, a global hub for such activity.

But then Beijing began tightening the screws.

On Nov. 14, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) Shanghai Bureau issued a notice to local government agencies in each district in the city to inspect and clear out businesses that offer crypto trading, fundraising, promotion and brokerage services. It later officially published the notice on its website, stating that it plans to nip the growing crypto fever in the bud.

And apparently, this is a nationwide effort. On Thursday, the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau issued a similar notice, vowing to crack down on initial coin offerings and fraudulent schemes that use blockchain as a marketing gimmick without any technological substance.

China Central Television (CCTV), a mouthpiece of the Chinese government, said in an article on Sunday that this is just the beginning as multiple cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou have all started taking similar measures.

To be sure, the crackdown has so far primarily targeted at what the state media called “air coins,” referring to those that are issued out of thin air without any real team or development, as well as smaller exchanges that would pump and dump these coins’ prices.

A Chinese government-backed report last week even claimed that 25,000 out of the 28,000 blockchain firms based in the country issued cryptocurrencies via illegal fundraising channels.

As a result, multiple state-owned media including CCTV, Xinhua, Economic Information Daily, and Securities Times, have all published news coverage over the past week to their nationwide audience about the return of “air coins” and the country’s crackdown efforts.

‘Safety concerns’

Meanwhile, trading services of major exchanges by volume such as Huobi, OKEx and Binance, which still serve Chinese investors, have not been affected by the crackdown so far.

That said, there are signs that these trading platforms have taken a step back, at least for the time being, in terms of their operations, marketing and promotional activities.

For instance, OKEx’s official Chinese-language Weibo account had been regularly posting daily updates of cryptocurrency market analysis, announcements regarding listing certain tokens and its Jumpstart initial exchange offering activities.

Yet since Nov. 14, the firm’s Weibo account has so far been only publishing posts on blockchain 101, and news coverage about blockchain applications.

On the other hand, the official Weibo accounts of Binance and blockchain project Tron, are still suspended, due to user complaints of violating laws, regulations or Weibo’s service terms.

Further, many of the blockchain and crypto-themed events originally scheduled in Shanghai in recent weeks had been either canceled or scaled down, according to two event organizers, who spoke under the condition of anonymity due to safety concerns.

One organizer said the wave of cancelations was due to either safety reasons or venue providers declined to collaborate amid the crackdown news, even though the events were to discuss blockchain tech and crypto-economics in general.

The other organizer said events or meet-ups that did go ahead also tuned down the scale by making it invite-only or nixing panels related to trading.

The crackdown on exchanges and projects that are promoting speculation has also led to WeChat’s ban of several accounts that publish content about crypto trading to subscribers.","A Bitcoin whale has transferred a whopping 44,000 BTC for a measly fee of just $0.32.

When making cross-border payments with traditional fiat currencies, payment processors often charge absurd fees depending on the amount transferred.

Digital currencies seek to remedy this by offering drastically cheaper fees, though it is also common to see some cryptocurrency exchanges charging high fees to cover costs and facilitate the buying and storing of coins.

However, one cunning crypto whale has managed to transfer almost $300 million worth of Bitcoin while paying only a microscopic fee.

The investor sent 44,000 Bitcoin from one unknown wallet to another unknown wallet and was only charged $0.32 for the entire transaction.

The whale’s activity can be monitored on Blokchain.com’s block explorer, which shows how the entire sum was sent in a single transaction for the obscenely low fee of 0.00004551 BTC.

Back in May, Coin Rivet reported that transaction congestion on the Bitcoin network had soared to an 11-month high.

At the time, the average fee for a transaction was roughly $2.50 – up by $0.75 from earlier in the same month.

The average transaction fee is currently approximately 0.000069 BTC according to bitinfocharts – or around $0.45 at the time of writing.

This figure is also calculated against the average transaction of 3.39 Bitcoin.

This shows that despite the whale moving an astronomically large sum, they have still only been charged a tiny fee.

Real Vision’s Raoul Paul hosts an interview with Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, who discuss the foundations of bitcoin and blockchain technology

BTC price outlook remains upbeat despite the recent crypto carnage due to Bitcoin’s long-term viability and overall utility that is not offered by traditional fiat currency

Raoul Paul of Real Vision holds an interview with founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), Barry Silbert, who is a pioneer in the cryptocurrency market and digitalization of financial assets. Despite the series of booms and busts, the narrative around crypto regarding its future place within the global financial system remains unchanged after the price of bitcoin inked a parabolic surge throughout 2017.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general have already changed how investors think about the crypto asset class and not just for speculation, says Barry, but also for its store of value characteristics. Barry tells Raoul Paul his controversial opinion how he believes investors will replace gold in their portfolios with bitcoin over the next couple decades as the utility (i.e. benefits) of crypto trumps that of gold and other precious metals. Yet, others still argue how bullion remains attractive.

The market cap of Bitcoin has ballooned from a few billion dollars back in 2014 to the $130 billion total value of Bitcoin circulating currently. Barry, who was on the forefront of skyrocketing btc prices when the cryptocurrency was trading around $300, argues that the crypto asset class is here to stay in light of the growing financial infrastructure and global acceptance.

Bitcoin trading has become increasingly popular, for example, which has provided liquidity for the digital currency. In fact, cryptocurrency speculators will soon start to trade US regulated bitcoin derivatives such as futures and options contracts. The expanding financial infrastructure could facilitate access for additional traders to enter the crypto market and potentially open up the door to institutional investors.

Yet, Barry points out that the crypto asset class journey is not straightforward. The use case for bitcoin and blockchain is still under development, but there is great potential to be unlocked. As such, the primary use case for bitcoin and crypto is speculation – that is not necessarily a bad thing. In order for bitcoin to reach its potential utility the size of the crypto asset class needs to continue to grow alongside expanding volume and velocity of transactions, which benefits from speculation.

This increases the liquidity of bitcoin as it is exchanged in and out of different currencies. Buying into the hypothesis that bitcoin will replace gold is the belief that there will be a convergence between the $8 trillion gold market and $125 billion bitcoin market. Bitcoin bulls are also betting on the possibility that substantial technological advancements might be made with blockchain technology, which could potentially become intertwined with the underpinnings of the global financial system.

BITCOIN TRADING RESOURCES","Crypto exchange Bitfinex and its sister firm, stablecoin issuer Tether, have again been accused of working to manipulate the bitcoin markets.

A new class-action suit, filed by Eric Young and Adam Kurtz at the district court in the Western District of Washington on Nov. 22, draws heavily from details that emerged in the case brought by the New York attorney general in April against the same two firms.

It’s also the second class action to have been brought in recent months relying on the New York case, which is still ongoing as the defendants appeal over whether they must continue to produce documentation. The attorney general claims, among other things, that that the tether (USDT) stablecoin was not fully backed by U.S. dollars.

In a lengthy list of claims, Young and Kurtz specifically allege that Bitfinex and Tether “monopolized and conspired to monopolize the Bitcoin market,” as well as manipulated the market, manipulated information or made inaccurate claims.

Further, “Defendants’ misconduct caused prices of Bitcoin futures, and the prices of Bitcoin underlying the Bitcoin futures, to be artificial during the Class Period [Oct. 1, 2014 to present],” Young and Kurtz say, adding:

""Defendants' control of USD₮ issuances and Bitfinex permitted Defendants and their co-conspirators to coordinate purchases and sales with rising and falling Bitcoin prices. When Bitcoin prices were falling, Defendants and their co-conspirators printed USD₮s and artificially increased the price of Bitcoin. Once Defendants and their co-conspirators artificially inflated the price of Bitcoin, Defendants and their co-conspirators then converted the Bitcoin back into USD₮s to replenish Tether's reserves.""

Both lawsuits also cite a study authored by professors at the University of Texas at Austin claiming that a single Bitfinex account used USDT to inflate the price of bitcoin in the lead up to its 2017 all-time high of around $20,000.

While the case has been brought at the federal court in Washington State, Young and Kurtz are based in Pennsylvania and New York, respectively. Both say they are bitcoin traders who traded at artificial prices due to the alleged actions of the defendants.

“At all relevant times, Defendants, including the employees that conducted Defendants’ affairs through illegal acts, knowingly and intentionally made false statements to U.S. Bitcoin investors and the public for the purpose of concealing Defendants’ scheme,” the suit states, further alleging that the defendants profited at plaintiffs’ expense.

Bitfinex took to its blog Sunday to call the Washington case “mercenary and baseless,” and suggest that such lawsuits “are a continuing affront to the efforts and dedication of Bitfinex’s customers and all participants in the digital currency ecosystem.”

“As we predicted last month, mercenary lawyers continue to try to use Bitfinex and Tether to obtain a payday. To be clear, there will be no nuisance settlements or settlements of any kind reached. Instead, all claims raised across both actions will be vigorously contested and ultimately disposed of in due course,” the exchange wrote.","Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the country’s financial regulator, plans to amend cryptocurrency rules to boost the growth of digital assets.

""The regulator must be flexible to apply the rules and regulations in line with the market environment,"" Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, secretary-general of the SEC, told Bangkok Post on Monday, adding that Thailand aims to be “competitive” with the global market.

Thailand initially adopted cryptocurrency rules in May 2018 via a royal decree, but the country hasn’t seen many companies coming forward to get authorized and launch their operations yet.

The decree covers four types of cryptocurrency businesses - exchanges, brokers, dealers and initial coin offering (ICO) or token portals. The first three are required to apply for licenses from the Finance Ministry, while ICO portals must be approved by the SEC.

To date, five companies have been awarded digital asset exchange licenses - Bitkub Online, Satang Pro Corporation (both are operating), Bitcoin Co (decided to shut down in August), Bitherb.net and Huobi Thailand (yet to start operations).

For digital asset brokers, Coin TH, Bitherb.net and Bitazza have been authorized, but the latter two are yet to commercially launch their services. While the approved ICO portals are Longroot Thailand, T-BOX Thailand Co and SE Digital Company.

Ruenvadee said since many firms have yet to begin operations, “we need to explore any possible obstacles” to the decree and overcome them.","In the Harry Potter universe, there’s a handy spell for when you need to stop someone from spilling your secret plans or shit-talking during a duel. It’s called Mimblewimble, otherwise known as the tongue-tying curse. It’s also the name of a privacy technology designed for cryptocurrencies—because, well, somebody’s gotta keep crypto weird.

The first coins to use Mimblewimble—distinct efforts called Grin and Beam—both launched in January. But arguments have since erupted over how private that underlying protocol actually is, after an independent researcher demonstrated an attack he says leaves its privacy model fundamentally crippled. Mimblewimble advocates say there are potential fixes. But Mimblewimble’s limitations—as well as vulnerabilities in Zcash and Monero, detailed in recent weeks—are a reminder of just how hard it is to guarantee privacy in the realm of digital money.

Private Lives

Privacy coins are a reaction to the realization that bitcoin isn’t private at all. Popular perception holds bitcoin as clandestine, but both the cops and the robbers are well past that. All bitcoin transaction data is public and open to all for analysis; combine that with some strategic subpoenas to get the personal data cryptocurrency exchanges are required to collect on their customers, and it’s pretty trivial to untangle who’s who. Doing so has become a big business. Federal procurement data indicates agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Department of Homeland Security now spend millions annually on software to help track down the people behind transactions. So the dark web has largely turned to privacy coins in the hopes of staying concealed.

""Keeping things anonymous and private is much, much harder than just getting the cryptographic aspects right."" Florian Tramer, Stanford University

That turns out to be a tall order. Take Mimblewimble, which gets its privacy in part by gathering lots of transactions into a single, inscrutable package. That makes it harder for a snooper to parse which transaction is which. An additional component used by Grin and Beam, called Dandelion, helps ensure this aggregation occurs before the transactions are broadcast to other nodes in the network. (First comes a “stem” of linked nodes, where the transactions are meant to combine, followed by the “flower,” when the transactions actually broadcast, hence Dandelion.) But former Google engineer Ivan Bogatyy says the protocol is flawed because an attacker could set up a node that listens in on all the others. Such a “supernode” would almost always snag transactions before aggregation, stem or no stem, and could be used to uncover who paid whom.

The attack demonstrates a known limitation of Mimblewimble, says Giulia Fanti, a professor at Carnegie Mellon and one of the Dandelion designers: “I think maybe it was more surprising to general users than the people who are actually working with the technology.” Part of the problem, she adds, is that the Harry Potter coins just aren’t used enough yet. Presumably, more transactions would mean faster aggregation, making it more difficult for the supernode to sniff out transactions that remain loose from the herd. That principle is true for a lot of anonymity tech, Fanti points out, which often rely on hiding yourself within a crowd.

The Harry Potter coin developers claim the attack isn’t so dire. Grin’s developer team says it's well aware that Mimblewimble’s privacy model doesn’t cover it, and has been working on solutions. Beam says it already mitigates the problem by using decoy transactions that make aggregation more effective.

But it’s still useful to demonstrate that a theoretical attack is also cheap and practical, notes Andrew Miller, a professor at the University of Illinois who also serves as a board member at Zcash Foundation. “It changes the conversation,"" he says. ""It didn’t even take a huge effort. It showed how widespread the problem is given the current scale of the network.”

Side Channel Blues

As a relatively young protocol, Mimblewimble doesn’t yet offer the same privacy guarantees as the methods used by Zcash and Monero, says Florian Tramer, a cryptography researcher at Stanford. They’ve been around longer, he adds, and rely on battle-tested cryptographic techniques like ring signatures and zero-knowledge proofs.","Nomura’s bid to bring custody and depositary services for cryptocurrencies to institutional investors has been boosted by the receipt of regulatory approval from the Jersey Financial Services Commission.

A notice on the regulator’s website confirmed that Komainu, established by Nomura, Ledger and Global Advisors Partners in May 2018, has been approved as a custodian and depositary.

Nomura, along with the likes of Fidelity and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)-owned Bakkt, are aiming to create a cryptocurrency ecosystem fit for institutional investors with the security and infrastructure they are familiar with when trading traditional assets. A spokesperson from Nomura declined to comment.

From a custody perspective, incumbent players such as State Street, Standard Chartered and Northern Trust, have been open to exploring servicing around digital assets without committing to an offering at this time.

In a joint statement from Nomura last year, the bank said Komainu was set up to “overcome barriers to institutional investment in digital assets with new services, standards and best practice”.

Earlier this month, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) approved Fidelity Digital Asset Services to provide a virtual currency custody and execution platform, on which institutional investors and individuals can securely store, purchase, sell, and transfer Bitcoin.

Earlier this year the EU financial watchdog said divergent definitions of safekeeping between regulations and national authorities should be addressed in order to overcome custody challenges for crypto-assets.

A paper published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) highlighted how there is no harmonised definition of safekeeping and record-keeping of ownership of securities at an EU-level, and would therefore be difficult to apply to a new asset class such as crypto."
2019-11-26,"Production of cryptocurrency units like Bitcoins is often referred to as ‘mining.’ This is a metaphor: the coins are actually secured via computers solving algorithms. But this process has real-world impacts. Each $1 of Bitcoin value created in 2018 was responsible for $0.49 in health and climate damages in the U.S. and $0.37 in China, researchers report in a new study.

The reason is that cryptocurrency mining uses a lot of electricity. Moreover, because of the way most cryptocurrencies are structured, the more coins that have already been produced, the harder the mining algorithms are to solve — so the electricity requirements are constantly increasing, along with the associated damages.

Last year, researchers calculated the electricity use and corresponding carbon emissions for four of the most prominent cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. They found that Bitcoin mining alone used more electricity in 2017 than did all of Ireland or Hong Kong. Between the start of 2016 and mid-2018, the four cryptocurrencies together were responsible for between 3 and 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

The new study builds on those findings. Researchers at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque first collected data on emissions of various pollutants associated with each kilowatt hour of electricity generation in the United States and China, two countries where a lot of cryptocurrency mining occurs. They used this to calculate the health and climate impacts – which they term ‘cryptodamages’ – per coin created.

Their estimate of climate damage is based on carbon dioxide emissions associated with electricity production. The estimate of health damages is based on exposure to fine particulate matter known as PM2.5, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, all of which are known to increase the risk of premature mortality. In some cases they extrapolated from more extensive U.S. data to make estimates for China.

In 2018, “the human health and climate damages caused by Bitcoin represented almost half of the financial value of each U.S. dollar of Bitcoin created,” the researchers write in the journal Energy Research & Social Science.

In China, climate change accounts for about 89% of cryptodamages, while the remaining 11% are due to human health effects. In the United States, about 60% of cryptodamages represent climate impacts and 40% health impacts.

This is because emissions associated with electricity production are higher in China than in the United States, but a measure that represents the economic losses from premature death is much lower (reflecting lower wages in China).

In fact, cryptocurrency mining in China takes a heavy toll in premature mortality. Every 50,000 Bitcoins mined in China are associated with 12 additional deaths due to particulate matter exposure, the researchers calculated.

Over time, the amount of electricity required to produce cryptocurrency coins has increased and the value of those coins has fluctuated. This means that mostly, the net benefit of cryptocurrencies to society has been eroding. In December 2018, damages from Bitcoin mining in the United States amounted to $0.95 for every $1 value of the coins.

It’s well known that, because of the ever-increasing effort required to mine coins, at some point a given cryptocurrency will no longer be profitable to mine. The researchers argue that it’s likely that the cryptocurrency’s social costs will outstrip its value well before that point of unprofitability.

Cryptocurrency miners tend to locate in areas with cheap electricity. But the cheapest electricity isn’t necessarily associated with the lowest environmental and health damages. And it’s hard to regulate and tax cryptocurrency mining in a way that would hold miners accountable for these damages. The development of new systems of cryptocurrency that aren’t so energy intensive could be a way to resolve this problem, the researchers suggest.

Indeed, while there are far more viable options for cryptocurrency custody than there have been at times of previous rejections, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton still raised his concerns regarding crypto custody just weeks before the decision to reject the application was made.

Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao – The Largest Financial B2B Expo

Indeed, Clayton told CNBC reporter Bob Pisani that while the crypto industry has come closer to satisfying the SEC’s concerns regarding custody, “there’s work left to be done.”

“How do we know that we can have custody and have a hold of these crypto assets? That’s a key question,” the Chairman asked.

Custody has always been a pain point for the industry–but are institutional investors using the viable custody options that are increasingly available?

Previously, in July, the SEC and FINRA issued a joint statement delineating their concerns about crypto custody: “the ability of a broker-dealer to comply with aspects of the Customer Protection Rule is greatly facilitated by established laws and practices regarding the loss or theft of a security, that may not be available or effective in the case of certain digital assets,” the statement read.

And indeed, though the situation has improved, a lack of viable crypto custody options has historically been a major pain point for the industry when it comes to institutional adoption. Indeed, a number of analysts have argued that once the right custody solutions are available, a wave of institutional capital could come rushing into the cryptosphere

However, although things have improved since 2018 (the institutional crypto custody space now has well-renowned participants like Fidelity, Coinbase, and ICE’s Bakkt), a recent study conducted by Binance Research found that institutional investors don’t seem to be using these custody services; instead, 92% of the institutional investors that responded to Binance’s survey said that they prefer to keep their crypto exactly where most experts least recommend–on centralized exchanges.

The vast majority of institutional investors keep their crypto on exchanges and hardly use third-party custody services, Binance Research survey says

Binance surveyed “76 participants across our English & Mandarin surveys, primarily composed of firms, funds, and institutions with respective allocations to cryptoassets ranging from $100K to more than $25M.”

And indeed, “exchanges remain as the most popular choice for cryptoasset storage amongst our institutional and VIP clients at 92.1%. When moving to self-storage, cold wallets are the second most favored choice, given their improved safety and control. Third-party custody services were the least popular option at 2.6%.”

The results of the survey are particularly surprising, given the fact that storing funds on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange is widely considered to be the least-safest way to store crypto. Indeed, cryptocurrency that is stored on an exchange is vulnerable to attacks by hackers, technical failures, or–in some circumstances–mishandling by the exchange itself.

There have been many examples of this: to name a few more recent and more extreme examples, Japan-based crypto exchange Coincheck was hacked for $530 million last year; also in 2018, QuadrigaCX CEO Gerald Cotten famously took the private keys to his exchange’s cold wallets with him to the grave. (Then, of course, there’s Mt Gox, BitGrail, Bithumb, and many, many more.)

Additionally, while most legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges have insurance or other kinds of contingency plans for restoring users’ lost funds should disaster strike, some do not–for example, most, if not all, QuadrigaCX users have yet to see a penny of what was lost to them.

So then–why do so many institutional investors seem to be leaving their funds at the mercy of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges?

Crypto’s “best practices” are still being built

Daniel Haudenschild, President of the Board of Directors at the Crypto Valley Association and CEO of SIBEX, a firm that creates new arbitrage opportunities for institutional traders, told Finance Magnates that while the survey’s results present “an impressive statistic,” it’s important to note that the results don’t take certain aspects of institutional crypto investing into account.

“Many companies are getting exposure to crypto through CFDs (contract for differences), tracking products, or ‘on-ledger’ trading solutions,” Haudenschild explained. “These solutions do not see actual on-chain transactions take place, so it is difficult to measure the exact exposure. It is clear, though, that there is significant exposure to centralized counterparties.”

That being said, however, Haudenschild told Finance Magnates that the apparent custodial over-reliance by institutional investors who do use cryptocurrency exchanges directly is simply a sign of the times: a new market that still has yet to truly establish best practices.

“The fact that most institutional investors trust centralized exchanges is indicative of the immaturity of the market,” Haudenschild said. “High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) are pushing their financial institutions for access to crypto against a backdrop of prolonged negative interest rates.”

Therefore, “few institutional investors have had the foresight to invest in the necessary infrastructure and talent to handle the demand. Many are now playing catch-up, using tactical interim steps to do so.”

But the consequences of this interim period could be severe. “Utilising centralized functions for storage is not recommended for crypto as it introduces significant unnecessary counterparty risk,” Haudenschild said. “This behavior shows clearly that many investors do not yet understand this market and struggle to identify the risk vectors and severity associated with digital assets. The learning curve will be steep as loss events take down entire ecosystems.”

”Most traders use cryptocurrency as a tool for profiting off of the price volatility, not for the underly properties of peer-to-peer trading.”

Kiara Bickers, author of Bitcoin Clarity: A Guide to Understanding, told Finance Magnates that the apparent reliance of institutional traders on cryptocurrency exchanges could simply be a marker of the kind of trading that institutions are engaged in within the space.

Indeed, Bickers said that the results of the survey were unsurprising “most traders use cryptocurrency as a tool for profiting off of the price volatility, not for the underly properties of peer-to-peer trading,” she said. “Traders can’t functionally trade if their funds aren’t on the exchange at all times.”

Economist Alex Krüger made a similar point on Twitter following the launch of Van Eck’s “BTC”, a sort of pseudo-crypto ETF that received almost no interest from institutional investors.

And it could very well be that that the kinds of institutional investors who are currently interested in Bitcoin and other kinds of crypto assets are not the type who would necessarily utilize third-party custodial services as long-term solutions: “institutional money already trades lots of bitcoin …. just not the type of institutions who are long term holders,” he wrote.

“They place trust in their wealth and asset managers as they have for generations. Which is ok, until it isn’t.”

Therefore, it’s possible that the longer-term solution to crypto’s custody battle may be to improve custody on cryptocurrency exchanges, or to integrate third-party solutions into them. “I’d like to see exchanges publish more detailed reports on how they’re managing their cold storage….Right now there isn’t much consumer demand pressing for the knowledge on how their funds are being stored, but there should be,” Bickers said.

However, Haudenschild said that the current situation is that although “custody is often provided for ‘free’ with trading accounts,” trading platforms tend to “focus primarily on increasing trading volume, and secondarily on hack-proof custody.”

But the onus to solve crypto’s custody problem cannot be placed completely on cryptocurrency exchanges– at the very least, there are several different points at which various financial cultures must change their behavior.

“Now that investment into digital assets has grown beyond the early adopters and tech enthusiasts, in many cases, the retail investors are driving the institutional investors. However, few HNW and Ultra high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) individuals understand the space well enough to manage their own infrastructure,” Haudenshild said.

“They place trust in their wealth and asset managers as they have for generations. Which is ok, until it isn’t.”

Therefore, “it would be good if this statistic (92%) is an interim step,” he said. “One would hope institutions offering exposure are also taking the strategic steps to provide in-house custody.”

Haudenschild pointed out that providing in-house will require a serious culture change in asset management: “most financial services companies have been spending the last ten years moving into a cloud architecture. Digital assets is one place where this trend is starting to reverse. Crypto is one area where companies should be maintaining their own in-house, on premise, custody solutions.”

”The most effective move centralized exchanges can make is to invest in decentralized solutions.”

However, the ultimate solution to crypto’s custody conundrum may eventually be to move away from the centralized model completely.

“Centralized exchanges, like brokers, are an interim step to market adoption,” Haudenschild said. “Centralized exchanges perpetuate a model with a fatal flaw; they need to grow to get liquidity, and the more they grow, the more they become more of a honeypot for hackers, and subsequently, they become more of a target for regulators.”

“This not only increases the cost profile but it is also a model that is pockmarked with major loss events that can close out entire markets from crypto investments,” he continued. “The market is moving towards decentralized infrastructure and peer-to-peer trading. The most effective move centralized exchanges can make is to invest in decentralized solutions.”

These decentralized solutions would automatically place the responsibility of custody in the hands of the investor themself or of their appointed third-party custodian. While self-storage carries its own set of risks, even for institutional investors, the mantra rings true–","Travala Partners With Booking.com - 90,000 Crypto Accepting Destinations Added

Travala Partners With Accommodation Aggregator Booking.com

During the last few years cryptocurrencies have been adopted by lots of companies, and crypto users can now spend their assets on all types of goods and services. The company Travala.com, launched in 2017, is an accommodation listings platform that covers a large selection of bookable places to stay like hotels, luxury resorts, apartments, hostels, and villas. Travala claims to offer prices that can be up to 40% cheaper than other prominent online booking platforms. Moreover, Travala accepts cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH) for accommodation payments. Travala also accepts BTC, ETH, DASH, LTC, EOS, XLM, ADA, BNB, XMR, TRX, XRP, and the stablecoin DAI. On November 25, The firm’s CEO Matt Luczynski revealed that Travala has now partnered with the online travel aggregator Booking.com. Luczynski added:

This partnership allows our users to access Booking.com’s accommodation listings, as well as the listings from several other leading travel suppliers, which is a fantastic use case for our own AVA token and another huge step towards mass cryptocurrency adoption.

One of the Largest Crypto-Supporting Online Travel Agencies by Number of Bookable Hotels

Booking.com is an accommodation listing aggregator founded in 1996 and the latest partnership brings an additional 90,000 destinations to over 230 countries worldwide to the Travala platform. Luczynski stressed that customers using Travala.com can pay for accommodations with the firm’s native token AVA plus 20 other popular cryptos. Users who leverage AVA will obtain exclusive discounts and loyalty rewards. Travala’s CEO says that Booking.com has noticed the value of making its properties available to the swelling cryptocurrency markets. “Such a move by Booking.com is a sign that we are close to seeing the industry’s acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a standard form of payment for travel bookings,” Travala’s announcement underlined.

In recent years a variety of firms have introduced cryptocurrency-friendly online travel agencies to the public. In May, U.K.’s Corporate Traveller revealed that it accepts BTC and BCH for small to medium enterprises (SME) customers. Another startup called Cryptocribs provides a peer-to-peer short-term rental system that utilizes digital assets like bitcoin cash and ethereum for payments. With the holidays approaching, news.Bitcoin.com’s Lubomir Tassev described a slew of crypto supporting travel sites like Travala, Cheapair, Bitcoin.Travel, Travelbybit, Destinia, Greitai, and Airtreks. Still, the partnership with Booking.com makes Travala.com “one of the largest online travel agencies in the world by number of bookable hotels.”

“Booking.com’s support for Travala.com illustrates the confidence it shares in this fledgling online travel agency and its commitment to supporting digital technology that helps take the friction out of travel,” Travala’s announcement concluded.

A piece in Time plots the plight of Venezuelan refugees streaming into Colombia after watching their national currency, the bolívar, dissolve into toilet paper.

Penned in 2018 by Alex Gladstein, the chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation, the article analyzes how hyperinflation and authoritarian governments push radical alternatives to the foreground.

Writes Gladstein,

“Venezuela isn’t the only place where people can use Bitcoin as an escape valve. In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe printed endless amounts of cash and inflated the savings of his citizens into nothing, but his successors can’t print more bitcoin.

In China, Xi Jinping can track all of your transactions on Alipay and WePay, but he cannot orchestrate mass surveillance on all Bitcoin payments. In Russia, Vladimir Putin can target an NGO and freeze its bank account, but he can’t freeze its Bitcoin wallet.”

Today Gladstein argues that Bitcoin will always exist as a means to exchange value. Acting as a global safety net, it may one day catch another group of people on the run: comfortable people, people who currently live in relatively stable countries, the very people who see no real need for Bitcoin or any decentralized currency that stretches beyond their government’s grasp.

That’s because China is creating the playbook on restriction and the modern, digital tools needed to control people around the world.

For countries like China, Bitcoin remains the ultimate wrench in the wheel. Says Gladstein,

“Bitcoin is a huge problem for them because it ruins their plans. It is a digital currency that they cannot control that is beyond their micro surveillance and is likely to get more difficult to control. So I guess the solace or the little silver lining for civil rights activists or anyone who is trying to push back against injustice, will be that Bitcoin will always exist and will always be an option. And even with peer-to-peer trading, you’ll always be able to access it.

So even in the most Orwellian circumstance, you could still meet up with someone in China and invite them over to my place and they could help me with ‘homework’ or something, and I could then pay them with this digital currency. And I could just write, ‘Oh, it was for homework.’ But on the side, they’re sending me Bitcoin and the Chinese government doesn’t know about it. So I think there will always be a way for us to have this sort of parallel economy.”

Gladstein brought his message to this year’s SlushHQ summit in Helsinki, Finland, where 25,000 people gathered from around the world, including 3,500 startups and 2,000 investors, to discuss how to build successful companies by harnessing new technologies for future economies.

He references a fictional future that has already arrived for hundreds of millions of people. It’s the future described by George Orwell in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, published in 1984, 35 years ago, where people only possess the thoughts in their minds, as everything else has been confiscated.

Gladstein explores the intentions behind China’s social credit system, which culls financial data from social media platforms and other public portals in order to draft a detailed profile of an individual to then dictate one’s financial options and freedoms, determining “what kind of loans you can get; what kind of internet you can get; what kind of schools your children can go to.”

“Don’t think this couldn’t happen in your country. It will be spreading around the world.”

ADVERTISEMENT","Money is life. For nearly every human being on the planet, it’s more important than children, mom, art, whatever. Technically, it’s a record of payment. It can be a currency, but it doesn’t need to be. For an abstract idea, both real and unreal, money is quite tangible. Money means your kids eat or go hungry. Money enables a bag of paper to be exchanged for a house full of appliances. Money can be sex. Money can be murder. Say “money” three times fast and it feels like a marble of vanilla ice cream rolling around on your tongue. And money is all kinds of emotional. It’s attached to self-worth, shame, and safety. The other morning I noticed my wallet had no more money in it, so I went to an ATM and a neurological reaction turned the feeling of ten pieces of paper in my hand into “happy,” “more relaxed,” “more secure,” all at once.

You may not know what money is, but you know what is money.

But now money’s changing, perhaps forever.

What is crypto? A couple years ago, crypto was the future, according to your cousin at Thanksgiving. It had something to do with Internet drugs in China? He couldn’t explain it very well; it sounded like another one of his schemes. But then, out of nowhere, crypto kind of was the future. Bitcoin bros the world over became millionaires. And then the bubble burst, everything went to hell, everyone consoled your cousin while breathing a sigh of relief, because crypto had disappeared, and none of you needed to figure out what the hell it had been. Only crypto didn’t disappear, it just went quiet. And this Thanksgiving, the evangelists will tell you it’s bigger, more relevant than ever, only they’re not just your cousin anymore. They’re the People’s Bank of China. They’re Mark Zuckerberg. Talking about crypto today is more like talking about the climate crisis. Forget real or unreal. It’s “how soon,” and “oh crap.”

Crypto is life. You just don’t know it yet.

The Rise and Rise of a Crypto King

Brian Kim is real, but that’s not his real name*. Kim immigrated to San Diego for graduate school in his early twenties. About a decade later, he is millennial in several ways that will be familiar to anyone watching recent sitcoms. He likes music and hanging out with friends. His parents have high expectations for him that he feels he does not quite fulfill. He doesn’t like his job and isn’t sure how it became his career, though it is lucrative: Kim is an elite academic coach with many clients who are wealthy, in some cases very, in a few cases ludicrously so, all of them quite happy to pay top dollar so their kids receive the best (legal) test prep that money can buy.

*In addition to providing this person with a pseudonym, certain identifying characteristics have also been changed.

Which is how Kim, by living in a small apartment (“very small”), minimizing his expenses, and subsisting on ramen packets for nearly a decade, managed to save a decent amount of money. And then suddenly become wealthy—very wealthy, even ludicrously so.

Kim heard about crypto from a friend I’ll call Derek*. “I think it was about 2013 or ’14,” Kim said. “[Derek] was like, ‘Hey, I’ve been looking into this and I really think maybe we should invest in some Bitcoin.’ ” Kim was intrigued, but he didn’t follow through. Like a lot of people, he’d heard about Bitcoin, the original crypto and still the OG, but it didn’t sound fully real. Then, in 2017, he tried buying some “altcoins.” An altcoin is essentially any cryptocurrency that isn’t Bitcoin; in October 2019, a database listed over three thousand of them. Some improve on Bitcoin’s core technology by offering more secrecy, or better security. Many are simply wannabes, copycats that inspire wildcat behavior, that get painted by the wide brush known as “shit-coin.” Still, some alts have outperformed Bitcoin itself; in 2017, a coin called XRP rose by 36,000 percent.","A Northern European digital assets exchange is to delist the privacy-focused monero cryptocurrency to align with international anti-money-laundering standards.

Estonia-based BitBay announced Monday that monero (XML) will no longer be tradeable from Feb. 19, 2020. However, the crypto exchange is to cease deposits of XML as of this Friday, Nov. 29, and will block withdrawals temporarily from Friday to Dec. 5 around the time of a planned monero hard fork.

All users must withdraw any remaining XML by 20 May, 2020, according to the notice.

Explaining the move, BitBay said monero is being delisted due to its privacy features. The cryptocurrency uses tech called ring signatures that jumble up small groups of transactions to obfuscate individuals’ identities.

“The decision was made to block the possibility of money laundering and inflow from external networks,” the firm said, adding that other crypto exchanges have dropped monero over the same concern.

“As a licenced exchange, BitBay has to follow the market standards. Compliance with market standards and regulations allows us to provide our clients with legal security and convenience of using the exchange, with the participation of a friendly banking system and the availability of payment operators,” BitBay said.

As mentioned, monero’s privacy protections have led to other trading platforms halting support in recent months. For example, OKEx Korea dropped XML, as well as horizen (ZEN) and super bitcoin (SBTC), in October. It said at the time it was reviewing a decision to delist zcash and dash as well.

Other privacy coins have been seen as too risky by some exchanges too. Coinbase dropped zcash from its U.K. platform in August. The move was likely a compliance push related to building a new banking relationship after being dropped by Barclays.","The IRS will be able to proceed with a summons on the cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp—despite a taxpayer’s attempt to intervene—if it sufficiently narrows its request, a federal judge said.

“The summons requests information that is irrelevant to the IRS’s stated purpose of auditing Petitioner’s 2016 amended return,” Judge John C. Coughenour of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington said in an order. “The summons is therefore overbroad.”

The judge’s stance is reminiscent of high-profile case involving an IRS John Doe summons on Coinbase Inc., one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. A court in 2017 approved the summons but forced the government to narrow its request.

The new case stems from the IRS’s decision in June 2018 to examine the 2016 return of taxpayer William A. Zietzke after he filed an amended return seeking a $15,475 refund for taxes paid on previously reported gains on his cryptocurrency transactions. During the audit the IRS learned that Zietzke had used the exchange, Bitstamp, to conduct at least one Bitcoin transaction in 2016 but hadn’t disclosed that transaction to the agency.

The IRS served a summons on Bitstamp seeking information on Zietzke’s holdings, which he tried to block in a June 2019 petition. The government responded with a motion to enforce the summons and deny Zietzke’s petition to quash it.

Bitstamp didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

The IRS said that federal law prohibits it from discussing specific taxpayers.



14-Day Deadline

The government must file a proposed amended summons within 14 days of the court’s Nov. 25 order, modifying several of its requests to demand information only relating to Zietzke’s 2016 transactions, Coughenour said in his ruling.

“Those requests may ask for information prior to 2016 only to the extent that the information is relevant to determining the tax implications of transactions in 2016,” the judge said.

Joseph P. Wilson, the founder of Wilson Tax Law Group APLC and Zietzke’s attorney, said early on he had asked the IRS to compromise and scale back the summons outside of court.

Wilson said he hasn’t read the judge’s entire decision and can’t speak to whether the court is asking the government to narrow the summons in the way he had originally requested.

“But the bottom line is if they had just at the beginning restricted the summons, we wouldn’t have had to go through this entire process,” he said Nov. 26.

If Zietzke and his attorneys want to oppose the government’s amended summons, they must do so within seven days of the government filing the narrowed summons, Coughenour said.

The Justice Department’s tax division, which is representing the IRS in the case, declined to comment.

That’s the message to anyone spooked by bitcoin’s brutal sell-off from several bullish experts interviewed by CoinDesk.

The bellwether cryptocurrency has tumbled 11.5 percent in the last week or so, likely due to a lack of positive catalysts entering the picture and China’s latest crackdown on digital asset trading. It briefly dipped below the psychological level of $7,000 and as of this writing is trading around $7,117. But zooming out the lens a bit and taking a macro perspective, experts note at least three plausible reasons to think this may be just a hiccup for bitcoin.

On the demand side, institutional trading platforms like Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Asset Services (FDAS) are starting to see uptake. Retail bitcoin purchases are on the rise at the popular consumer app Square as well. And all else equal, the expected halving of mining rewards next year bodes well on the supply side since it will reduce the amount of new bitcoin regularly injected into the market.

“While the latest drop in price is a short-term cause for concern, the fundamentals around BTC and increasing institutional adoption continue up and to the right,” said Jehan Chu, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Kenetic, a venture capital and trading firm based in Hong Kong.

Bakkt to business

After a disappointing start in September, the Bakkt futures market has started to ramp up in earnest, hitting an all-time high on Nov. 22, with 2,728 contracts traded. That was a 68 percent increase on the day prior while open interest was up 29 percent on the day. Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not yet been settled.

A subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange), Bakkt is a regulated platform and exchange for the purchase, sale and storage of crypto assets aimed at institutional traders and companies.

Its role has been to increase confidence and trust within the crypto-sphere amongst larger funds by offering more sophisticated trading instruments such as futures contracts that can be utilized to hedge against risk.

“It’s actually good that it’s going to take longer for bitcoin to hit the next all-time high because it shows how the market is maturing and with more institutions jumping in,” said Josh Rager, an analyst and co-founder at Blockroots, an education platform for trading focused on the BTC market and crypto-assets.

High Fidelity

Similarly, platforms targeting large investors, such as FDAS, launched earlier this year by mutual-fund powerhouse Fidelity Investments, provide a vital service for those larger funds seeking a safer avenue to enter crypto without having to rely on exchanges to store their crypto. They are likely boosting long-term sentiment by providing custody options for digital assets, experts told CoinDesk.

Fidelity Digital Assets, the nascent cryptocurrency trading business servicing institutional investors, also features an onboarding service with dedicated client support that makes the process of entering the space more convenient and legit from a large investor’s perspective.

Institutional adoption continues at a “rapid pace,” said Gabor Gubacs, director of digital assets strategy at asset management firm VanEck.

“Lower BTC prices are more accessible and healthier entry points for new BTC allocators,” said Gubacs.

To be sure, it’s not as accessible as some may have hoped. Gurbacs’ firm, for example, withdrew a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from consideration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in September, after the regulator signaled it was in no hurry to approve any such vehicle for retail investors. Instead, VanEck is selling shares in an ETF-like bitcoin fund strictly to institutions.

Squaring off

Another encouraging sign for the bulls is the fact that first-time buyers of bitcoin through Square’s Cash app have roughly doubled, with the company’s bitcoin revenue climbing 244 percent year-over-year to $1.27 billion in the third quarter.

Admittedly, Square only started offering bitcoin purchases in November 2017 (near the peak of the last bull market), so that triple-digit growth is from a small base. Also, the company’s profits from bitcoin sales have been comparatively tiny, in the low seven figures.

Still, for Chu, the data bolsters the case for optimism, when combined with the developments on the institutional side.

“Bakkt trading volumes are steadily increasing, retail purchases on Square are at high levels, and platforms like Fidelity continue to create comprehensive access to Bitcoin for their customers – all of which are bullish long-term signs for bitcoin,” Chu said.

'Fundamentals are different'

Then there are the key metrics about the asset itself. Rager noted that the hash rate, a measure of how much computing power is being devoted to the bitcoin network, has tripled since the previous all-time price high of $20,000 December 2017.

In his interpretation, institutions are selling to force weaker hands to capitulate, so the larger funds can accumulate BTC at lower prices ahead of the halving expected in May 2020.

Jonny Moe, a crypto day trader and analyst, agreed that the halving was the single biggest factor relating to the bullish long-term case and that BTC itself is a deflationary currency whose purchasing power should grow over time.

“To this point, all the evidence we have is that price has respected this disinflation in supply,” Moe said. “Until we see it stop following this four-year cycle, the most simplistic long term view is to just respect it and let it continue.”

But bear in mind that this point is up for debate. Some traders aren’t sure history will repeat itself. Previously, those buying bitcoin in anticipation of the halving had the wind at their back, in the form of an already-bullish market, crypto trader Willy Woo noted recently.

“Well this time around, we have gone $14k->$7.5k and that’s killing off weak miners who are dumping and dying,” Woo tweeted. “This adds to the already bearish action, so no happy front running 6-months out due to sell pressure. You can’t draw repeat fractals, the fundamentals are different.”","In 2019, the total volume of cryptocurrency-related fraud and theft resulted in losses worth $4.4 billion, according to CipherTrace’s report for the third quarter of 2019.

In its “Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2019 Q3,” security research firm CipherTrace delved into the 120 most popular cryptocurrency exchanges’ compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements and analyzed patterns in crypto-related crimes.

Decline in crypto crime volume and weak KYC standards

Per the report, Q3 2019 saw a notable reduction in total cryptocurrency crimes as compared with previous quarters, and thus the lowest quarterly thefts and scams in two years:

“This quarter, cybercriminals stole $6.5 million from cryptocurrency exchanges, while insiders bilked cryptocurrency users out of $9 million in exit scams and Ponzi schemes. This total of $15.5 million represents the smallest number of cryptocurrency crimes of any quarter in the past several years.”

However, total losses from crypto theft on the year have sky-rocketed since 2018, as crypto thieves go after larger sums. Crypto thefts accounted for $4.4 billion in losses, up from $1.7 billion the year previously.

Two particular scams, the PlusToken scheme ($2.9 billion) and the QuadrigaCX crypto exchange fiasco ($195 million) accounted for the vast majority of losses.

Out of the 120 analyzed crypto exchanges, 35% have strong KYC standards, 41% have “porous” standards and 24% have weak KYC standards. 32% of the top-120 exchanges trade privacy coins.

Recent high-profile crypto fraud cases

Cyber criminals are developing new and more sophisticated methods to obfuscate the flow of funds. On Nov. 26, Slovakian software security firm Eset discovered that cybercriminals behind the Stantinko botnet have been distributing a Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency mining module via Youtube. This crypto-stealing malware has reportedly infected around 500,000 devices.

Earlier today, major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit — which is run by a subsidiary of Korean tech giant Kakao — notified users of the theft of 342,000 Ether (ETH) (over $50 million at press time) from its hot wallet. The exchange pledged to protect user assets, stating that the lost funds will be covered by corporate assets.

Earlier this month, Gregg Bennett, a SIM-swap hack victim and angel investor, sued cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex over allegedly allowing the theft of nearly $1 million in Bitcoin (BTC).","South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has lost cryptocurrency worth $49 million, the exchange has confirmed.

Upbit’s CEO said in a blog post at 9:00 UTC on Wednesday that an abnormal transaction from its wallets had resulted in the outflow of 342,000 ether (ETH) earlier today.

The exchange said the loss will be covered by its own assets. Meanwhile, withdrawals and deposits have already been suspended as a precaution. The firm estimated that it will take “at least two weeks” for services to be back to normal.

According to transaction tracking site Whale Alert, the lost ether – worth $49 million at press time – was sent from Upbit’s wallet to an unknown ethereum address starting with 0xa09871 about 04:00 UTC on Wednesday.

About 30 minutes later, Upbit announced that it had temporarily suspended withdrawals and deposits “due to server maintenance.”

In fact, more than $100 million worth of multiple cryptocurrencies have been sent out from Upbit today. However, the exchange said all other transactions, apart from the abnormal ethereum outflow, were the exchange moving cryptos from hot wallets to cold wallets to prevent further losses.

Starting from around 5:00 UTC, 10 transactions, each of $1.51 million-worth of tron (TRX), as well as $3.5 million in BitTorrent (BTT), were further sent to unknown blockchain addresses, according to Whale Alert.

After that, transactions of $8.7 million-worth of stellar (XLM), $1.08 million in OmiseGo (OMG), $22 million in EOS, and $3.4 million in status (SNT) were further transacted from Upbit’s wallets to those of the Bittrex crypto exchange.","For better or worse, the month of November has always been one to remember in the world of Bitcoin.

Reasons cited for its volatile moves during the 11th month of the year run the gamut from tax-loss harvesting, to its round-the-clock trading nature, to Mercury being in retrograde. It could also just be coincidence. Whatever the cause, Bitcoin tends to go berserk in November.

Take this month, when the world’s largest cryptocurrency fell for 10 consecutive days through Tuesday of this week, notching its longest streak of down days on record. Even with Wednesday’s 6% rebound, the retreat pushed its price down about 17% and put it on pace for its worst month since November of last year. That was when Bitcoin posted its second-worst run in its history — a streak of nine down days that saw it lose 38% of its value through the end of the month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

November has also been substantially more volatile for Bitcoin compared with other months, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Since 2011, its biggest monthly change up or down has occurred in November, with the average move coming in about 20 percentage points higher than the next largest.

“It just moves in ways that are not cyclical like other businesses and other markets,” Bobby Cho, a partner at CMS Holdings, said in a phone interview. “Toward the end of the year, other asset classes may start to quiet down just because it’s the holidays and things like that. But in crypto, because of the global nature and it never closing effectively, things are always happening.”

For years now, Bitcoin’s explosive November moves have made it a hot topic at Thanksgiving dinners around the country. This time in 2017, for instance, Bitcoin evangelists had a lot to be thankful for, with investors and speculators alike hopping on the crypto gravy train while it soared at an unprecedented rate. Through Thanksgiving day that year, Bitcoin had already posted a monstrous 760% gain for the year.

Fast forward to last year and those even remotely tied to the industry had a lot more explaining to do. The day before Thanksgiving, Bitcoin was trading around $4,400, having dropped about 69% for the year.

“Price and emotions tend to work together so when prices are at all-time highs, everyone is euphoric and probably way over their skis with regard to how fast this industry is going to grow,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Los Angeles-based investment firm Arca, said by phone. “And when things are in contraction, prices are down, everyone is depressed and acting like the world is ending.”

And this year? Despite its recent drop, Bitcoin’s still up about 95% in 2019, though it’s far off its all-time high of near $20,000 reached in December 2017. A swirl of negative headlines pushed crypto prices lower this month, chief among them China’s sudden and swift crackdown on the trading of digital assets.

Still, the decline has left many undaunted. If anything, they say, it’s a sign cryptocurrencies are maturing — the price swings are similar to those in other asset classes. After all, the argument goes, it’s still a relatively nascent market.

For Nigel Green of deVere Group, the fluctuations are no different than volatility that’s prevalent elsewhere.

“There are peaks and troughs in all financial markets; the cryptocurrency market is not — and should not be — any different,” said the firm’s chief executive officer. “Each time there is a dip in the market or a bout of volatility in cryptocurrencies, the crypto haters declare that digital currencies are finished — only for them to subsequently experience a rally. The same people do not make such extreme and unfounded statements with most other financial markets.”","Since the crypto boom in 2017, the destinations that have been named as global blockchain and cryptocurrency industry hubs have remained fairly static. Switzerland, Malta, and Gibraltar have earned reputations as some of the most crypto-friendly countries in terms of regulation; the UK and various parts of the United States have become known as the centers of building institutional infrastructure for blockchain. The APAC region has largely been identified as crypto’s innovation capital.

However, it seems that a new global industry hub is forming in a new region of the world.

Indeed, Turkey–situated between Greece, Syria, and Iraq, and with a population of roughly 80.8 million–seems to be crypto’s new hotspot.

In a recent interview with Turkish news source Anadolu Agency, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that “Turkey plays a leading role in this field, giving it the chance to lead financial technology development. If Turkey takes the right steps, it will become a very important actor in the field of financial technologies in the near future.”

CZ: “Turkey is a vibrant country that has illustrated one of the strongest demands and fast-growing interest in crypto.”

Binance also recently launched a fiat-to-crypto gateway for the Turkish Lira in what seems to be a clear effort to begin further establishing itself in Turkish markets. The company said in a blog post published earlier this week that “we have also partnered with Turkey-based Papara to allow users to soon purchase BNB, BTC, ETH, and XRP on Binance with the country’s currency.”

Changpeng Zhao reiterated his enthusiasm for the nation’s crypto industry in the announcement of the gateway’s launch: “Turkey is a vibrant country that has illustrated one of the strongest demands and fast-growing interest in crypto,” he said.

“Turkey has quickly adopted crypto in just the last year as the country faced economic uncertainties, which correlates with global economic markets but twice the rate from its neighboring European countries.”

The cryptocurrency exchange also has a devoted Binance Türkiye Twitter account with just over 4,330 followers.

Huobi’s “aggressive” expansion into Turkey

And Binance isn’t the only major exchange to have turned its eye to Turkey. Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi announced in October that it also has plans to open up a fiat-to-crypto gateway within the country.

Huobi also announced in June that it would be expanding “aggressively” into the Turkish market over the following year. In addition to the fiat-to-crypto gateway, the exchange said it was developing plans to “[establish a] branch office with local resources in Turkey, and localized products and customer services.”

What was the reason behind the “aggressive” expansion? Mohit Davar, EMEA regional president of Huobi Group, told Finance Magnates that the decision was motivated by the way in which Turkish citizens seem to be rapidly adopting the technology themselves: “we recently entered the Turkey market because a growing number of Turks are buying and using cryptocurrencies,” Davar explained.

“Turkey has one of the highest crypto adoption rates in the world and much of that is due to the country’s favorable environment for blockchain innovation and the government’s pro-blockchain stance,” he continued, pointing to the Turkish government’s efforts toward supporting the growth of the blockchain industry.

“For example, the Turkish government is working on a framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and has previously declared its intention to create a national blockchain infrastructure to support the real-world deployment of blockchain in the public sector. As such, we consider Turkey as one of the most exciting markets for crypto trading,” Davar continued.

A strong community

Davar also said that Huobi has taken note of the community that has formed around cryptocurrency in Turkey. “Not only are we seeing more crypto demand and usage from local consumers, but Turkey’s crypto community is also thriving,” he said.

“Many young Turks are actively working to build innovative new blockchain-based projects and local universities incorporating blockchain into their curriculum at an unprecedented pace. Turkey has the potential to contribute to the broader crypto ecosystem at a global scale.”

20% of people in Turkey have owned or used cryptocurrency–one of the highest rates of adoption in the world

Indeed, there has been quite a bit of evidence supporting the theory that Turkey is developing into a global crypto hotspot.

In an email to Finance Magnates, Erhan Korhailler, CEO of blockchain PR agency EAK Digital and founder of Istanbul Blockchain Week 2020, cited a Statista Global Consumer Survey, saying that “20% of people in Turkey had owned or used cryptocurrency,” which, he added, “is one of the highest [rates of adoption] in the world.”

“Owning cryptocurrency is most common in Turkey…One in five Turks said they had used or currently owned cryptocurrency in the 2019 online poll,” said Statista data journalist Katharina Buchholz of the survey, which recorded the results of 1000 global respondents.

Korhailler also pointed to the fact that Turkey has announced that it will be launching a digital Lira next year, an announcement that came in Turkey’s Annual Presidential Program earlier this month. Anadolu Agency also reported that “the country also aims to create a roadmap for the development of Fintech ecosystem and establish a financial technopark in Istanbul.”

Additionally, Korhailler told Finance Magnates that in September, Turkey released its Strategy 2023 report, which detailed how it plans to implement Distributed Ledger Technology into the Turkish financial ecosystem. The report “came hot on the heels of a recent ING survey which found that over 40% of people surveyed in Turkey said they would prefer it if cash no longer existed, with 62% having a positive attitude towards crypto.”

Economic instability may have fostered the adoption of crypto in Turkey

But why exactly has cryptocurrency adoption been so high? “

Sukhi Jutla, COO and Co-Founder UK-based gold jewelry B2B blockchain platform MarketOrders, told Finance Magnates that like many other nations that have leaned toward blockchain technology, Turkey’s movements toward blockchain are likely a result of economic turmoil.

“An increasing number of Turkish people are already using cryptocurrencies and the increased financial instability in the economy lately has opened up this opportunity,” she explained to Finance Magnates.

“With the Turkish Lira having experienced a significant fall in value over the recent years due to economic instability, cryptocurrencies can have a chance to flourish in this environment.”

Indeed, in July of this year, the New York Times published a piece entitled “Turkey’s Long, Painful Economic Crisis Grinds On,” which said that “Turkey’s currency remains battered, while its foreign debts remain vast. Inflation and joblessness are alarmingly high. Economic growth is minimal, and anxiety considerable amid the sense that more trouble lies ahead.”

Data from Bloomberg also shows that the Turkish Lira suffered major falls in 2018, although it has recovered somewhat throughout 2019.

In August 2018–during the midst of the economic crisis–a Bitcoin user operating under the name “Bitmov” told CoinDesk that “I started personally trading crypto 1.5 years ago because of the weakness of the Turkish lira, and fear of the political, and financial, status of the Turkish government. Cryptocurrency makes me feel much safer.”

Turkey is open for business and ripe for international adoption,” but the global impact of the Turkish crypto industry is not yet clear

However, Sukhi Jutla pointed out that although the lean toward blockchain may have been born out of instability, the country could potentially use its movements toward blockchain as an opportunity: “it is in these conditions that Fintech can thrive so Turkey has a unique opportunity to become significant leaders in this field if they focus on developing this industry,” she said.

Indeed, “Turkey is open for business and ripe for international adoption and partnerships,” Korhailler said. “The blockchain and crypto community need to wake up and see what Turkey can do for their projects…I think Istanbul and Turkey will become a hub for blockchain in 2020 and beyond.”

But although Turkey seems to show so much promise as a global hotspot for innovation and adoption, Korhailler said that he doesn’t yet see the global impact of Turkey on the cryptocurrency industry: “I don’t think Turkish markets have impacted the crypto sphere,” he said.

“There is a high level of support and adoption for blockchain, from the government to the general public, but many people still cannot name any specific crypto project,” adding that this was part of the inspiration behind the creation of the Instabul Blockchain Week.

Will blockchain be Turkey’s “killer app”?

Indeed, Turkey’s potential influence on the global crypto industry could be particularly strong if it manages to launch its digital currency next year, according to its plans; if successful, the country could become one of the first in the world to implement a national cryptocurrency, and could possibly leverage its digital currency internationally with the right kinds of trading incentives.

But even if a Turkish digital currency won’t be on the market by next year, a recent report by JPMorgan said that the Turkish “has indicated its desire to phase out the use of cash. Turkey has plans to become a cashless society by 2023, an ambitious goal that could help drive use of cards and additional payment methods including digital wallets.”

In other words, there is a big push within the country to go digital–and from here on out, a technological race to the top of the economy seems inevitable. There is an opening for a new digital financial infrastructure in Turkey, and crypto and blockchain technology could potentially fill it; however, if another technology is more available and more viable, it’s possible that crypto and blockchain could eventually be left to the wayside.

Will blockchain win this race? What are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments below.","Every holiday conversation about cryptocurrency over the last few years boils down to one question: Should I buy some?

Whether your grandma corners you in the kitchen or your uncle nudges you during dinner, it seems everybody wants to know if they can make a quick buck off bitcoin. Hope springs eternal. As you settle in for the Thanksgiving weekend, you can welcome these inquiries because Quartz has you covered with an easy guide.

How’s bitcoin doing these days?

Tell your family: The market is bouncing back.

This year has been delightfully kind to bitcoin buyers, providing an 88% return year-to-date. If you bought one bitcoin on Jan. 1, 2019, your investment (of $3,750) would now be worth about $7,000.

Of course, that gamble would have peaked near $12,000 in August before tapering off rather dramatically. November, in particular, has been a tough month for the digital currency, with bitcoin falling to a six-month low.

Why the sudden drop in prices?

Tell your family: China is cracking down (again).

Some analysts have blamed the downturn on China, which—after briefly embracing blockchain—renewed its crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges. Since late 2017, the country has officially banned crypto trading, but a thriving underground economy remains for over-the-counter, or person-to-person, swaps. China has expressed opposition to mining, the energy-intensive process used to confirm transactions and earn new bitcoin. (There’s also a chance the country could issue a digital yuan, but that remains to be seen.)

Do you think bitcoin will bounce back?

Tell your family: Most likely.

Yes. In crypto, volatility is the name of the game. If I were a betting man, I’d say bitcoin may even reach $20,000 again. The most enthusiastic crypto watchers are waiting for May 2020, when bitcoin’s issuance rate—the speed at which new units enter circulation—is expected to drop sharply. Currently, mining bitcoin provides a “block reward” of 12.5 bitcoins ($90,000). Soon enough though, that reward will programmatically halve to 6.25 bitcoins, a process that will intermittently repeat.

Eventually, the reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoins around 2024 and then 1.5625 bitcoins sometime in 2028. (Note: This process will continue until 21 million bitcoins have been distributed. You can keep track of the “Halvening” with any of these trackers.) The 18 millionth bitcoin was mined in October and as issuance dwindles, some believe the price will spike again. Others say the halvening is already priced in. Just remember: bitcoin’s supply is finite—when the 21 millionth coin has been mined, that’s all there will ever be.

What’s going on with that Facebook coin?

Tell your family: It’s a mess…

So you’ve heard of Libra! It’s Facebook’s digital currency, which it announced in June. The truth is, Libra’s not really a cryptocurrency. Facebook just uses a bunch of fancy marketing language, but hey.

Nobody really knows if Facebook’s going to launch Libra—it’s been beset by delays, regulators hate it, and some of Facebook’s most prominent partners already quit the project. Last month, Facebook waved goodbye to Mastercard and Visa, among others. Although Facebook’s crypto strategy is on the rocks, it’s worth paying attention to WhatsApp Pay and the recently announced Facebook Pay. Whether or not Facebook goes “all-in” on crypto, the company’s trying to find a way into your wallet.

So, level with me—is bitcoin a good investment?

Tell your family: Nobody can determine bitcoin’s value. Ultimately investing in bitcoin is betting that somebody else will pay more for it in the future.

Buying bitcoin is like going to Las Vegas. Sure, you could double your money, but you could just as easily lose your shirt. Bitcoin is like the stock market on steroids and it’s even less regulated. Lots of crypto traders are still worried about market manipulation.

Ultimately, I can’t say whether bitcoin is a good or bad investment, but it’s an exciting one. Telling people you own $100 of bitcoin makes you part of the club—and it will probably make you question things about the financial system.

To me, that is the investment. Bitcoin is the ultimate teacher. It challenges preconceived ideas about money and helps a person realize that our institutions are surprisingly frail.

For me, $100 is just the right amount to feel a rush when bitcoin rises—and it’s upsetting (but not devastating) when it plummets. Personally, I think people should consider retirement investments before making a short-term gamble, but everyone wants to live a little. So, why not? Have fun and buy a lottery ticket.

Bitcoin has created a hammer candle on the three-day chart, a warning of an impending bull reversal. However, a break above the candle's high of $7,380 is needed to confirm the short-term trend change.

A move above $7,380 would activate twin bullish cues on the 4-hour chart and allow a rally to $8,000.

Acceptance below Monday's low of $6,515 would imply a continuation of the sell-off from recent highs above $10,000.

Bitcoin needs to break above $7,380 to confirm a short-term bull reversal and invite stronger buying pressure, the three-day chart indicates.

Specifically, the top cryptocurrency by market value created a hammer candle in the three days to Nov. 26. A hammer candle, which comprises of a long lower shadow and a small upper body, means the three-day period began with pessimism, but ended on a more optimistic note.

Stepping back, the cryptocurrency ran into selling pressure near $7,350 on Nov. 24 and fell to six-month lows near $6,500 on the following day. The drop, however, was short-lived and prices quickly rose back to $7,380 before printing a UTC close at $7,159 on Nov. 26. The recovery from $6,500 to $7,159 represents the long lower shadow of the hammer and the spread between $7,350 and $7,159 represents the body.

While the pattern is considered a bullish signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow-through, preferably a convincing move above the high of the hammer candle. That means a break above $7,380 is needed to confirm a bullish reversal and possibly lead to a stronger recovery rally.

BTC is changing hands at $6,917, representing a 2.4 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, after a sudden drop soon before press time.

Many in the investor community are associating the latest decline with confirmation of a $49 million crypto theft at the South Korean exchange Upbit. The exchange said large ether transfers had been made to an unknown wallet.

Popular analyst Joseph Young, however, believes the price drop seen in the last few minutes may not be driven by the Upbit news.

3-day chart

The long lower shadow attached to the hammer candle indicates seller exhaustion. If the current three-day candle ends (Friday, UTC) above $7,380, a bullish hammer reversal would be confirmed. That would open the doors to $8,000.

On the other hand, a close below the hammer’s low of $6,515 would imply a continuation of the sell-off from highs above $10,000.

4-hour chart

A move above $7,380 would activate twin bullish cues on the 4-hour chart: an upside break of the descending trendline and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the line chart.

The

latter would create room for a rally to $8,245 (target as per the measured move

method).

That target looks possible, as the 14-day relative strength index is reporting oversold conditions with a below-30 reading.

Moreover,

the location of the hammer candle is a good reason to believe a stronger bounce

is in the offing.

A hammer candle represents bearish exhaustion, as noted earlier and gains credence when it appears following a notable price drop, which is the case here.","Crypto ATM provider Bitstop is rolling out new machines in partnership with the U.S.’s largest retail shopping mall operator.

Bitstop installed five bitcoin ATMs in Simon Property Group locations over the past month – in Carlsbad Premium Outlets in Carlsbad, California, Mall of Georgia in Buford, Georgia, Miami International Mall in Miami, Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, and The Avenues in Jacksonville, Florida – expanding the company’s exposure to first-time bitcoiners as it eyes a booming crypto ATM market.

They’re part of Bitstop’s drive to woo crypto newcomers: people who shop in malls, don’t understand blockchain and have never opened a bitcoin wallet, according to co-founder and CEO Andrew Barnard.

He said these locations are akin to the old cliche: “If you build it, they will come.”

“Once you put these ATMs down and you give people easy access, the people go and figure out how to use it,” Barnard said.

With these new locations, Barnard says Bitstop is continuing to build out exposure among newcomers and handhold them through the process of buying their first bitcoin. He said the kiosks represent a gateway to first-timers.

Barnard said Bitstop’s data demonstrates a wide variety of users and use cases. He said people purchase from an ATM as an investment, but also to then buy online or send remittance payments home.

The average purchase is $160 dollars. And Barnard said traffic is especially heavy around the first and 15th day of each month, which he said is payday for many users.

Placing them in malls in time for the holiday shopping season positions Bitstop for a customer influx. America’s 10 busiest shopping days are set to come between Black Friday (Nov. 29) and Jan. 1, data analysis firm Sensormatic predicts.

That foot traffic increases exposure and drives new users, who associate longevity with the physicality of the ATMs, Barnard said.

“Having it at a mall makes people go, ‘wow, I guess bitcoin is going to be around for a long time,’” he said.

Bitstop is one of the older players in the American Bitcoin ATM sphere. Barnard said the company launched in 2013 and installed its first bitcoin ATM two years later, in Florida.

However, its network of 130 U.S. kiosks are dwarfed by some of the larger brands. LibertyX, the first company to release a Bitcoin ATM back in 2014, installed its 1000th location this summer.

Bitcoin ATMs are a rapidly-growing corner of the retail crypto space. Kiosks have been installed in convenience chains across the Southwest, Family Dollar stores and gas stations.","David is a tech journalist who loves old-school adventure games, techno and the Beastie Boys.

Eagle-eyed cryptocurrency fans spotted a Bitcoin address in USA Network’s Mr Robot and decided to start sending BTC.

In the latest episode, vigilante hacker Elliot Alderson codes a program for “cleaning coins” with a “crypto tumbler.” Presumably, he’s looking to steal some Bitcoin, and wants to cash it out without being caught.

Screencap courtesy of reddit, USA Network

Elliot’s mixer is likely to make tracking Bitcoin more difficult, much like popular BTC solution CoinJoin, which allows multiple users to shuffle coins with each other to hide their history.

These programs have grown in popularity in response to the rise of analytic firms like Elliptic and Chainalysis over the past year.

‘Elliot’ has siphoned some Bitcoin already

In the screenshot above, the auto-complete in Elliot’s programming environment suggests a Bitcoin address: 1MbwAEKJCtPYpLPxEkUmZxwjk63nQrpbXo.

Five transactions recorded so far

Plugging that address into Blockchain.com’s explorer shows it’s been featured in five BTC transactions since the episode aired on November 24.

While the total amount sent to “Elliot” is pretty small, just 0.0044470 BTC ($32), what’s curious is some of that Bitcoin appears to have been siphoned already.

‘Thanks for the tips!’ – Elliot Alderson

Indeed, whoever controls that Bitcoin address sent a combined 0.00030343 BTC ($2.20) to external addresses two days ago. Curiously, one of those addresses, a “multi-sig” wallet, has seen quite a bit of usage.

Over the past few months, that address has received almost 1.5 BTC ($10.9K), and seen 350 transactions. It currently houses 0.94 BTC ($6.8K).

2019-11-28,"Bitcoin has been sliding amid a lack of capital inflows, raising questions about the future for bitcoin in the long-term.

Some analysts argue the nascent market has a long way to go before reaching maturity, as seen in traditional markets, where smoothed volatility and liquidity are important factors. While others imply scarcity inherent in its algorithm is the main factor for bitcoin’s perceived value, now and in the future.

A poll conducted by Alex Kruger, a macro cryptocurrency analyst, shows the majority of Crypto Twitter participants think bitcoin (BTC) will ‘eventually’ mature and settle into a wide price range, resembling the traditional commodities markets in real-terms.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

To drive home what he meant, Kruger said “something that settles into a range in real terms still trends in nominal terms due to inflation, as most commodities do.”

But timing is always the question and BTC could be faraway from that level of maturity, where it ‘settles’ into a defined range as the budding market of cryptocurrency moves into its 10th year.

Willy Woo, a crypto on-chain analyst and trader, said the price of BTC still had some ways to go in discovering a price ceiling.

“Anything between a [market capitalization] of $10 trillion to $100 trillion is fair game,” Woo said.

BTC’s market capitalization, a measurement of total coins in circulation multiplied by its spot price, stands at $204.4 billion, down from its yearly peak of $233 billion witnessed June 27, according to information provided by Messari, a cryptocurrency data provider.

Kruger said volatility is likely due to the lack of total capital in the space right now. As the market cap increases, the impact to BTC by large market participants, aptly named “whales”, is likely to be less impactful in shifting price.

That is a sobering fact for retail investors as volatility tends to be the most attractive aspect to cryptocurrency trading.

For institutional investors, it would be a welcome change.

Nic Carter, Partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on public blockchains, said BTC resembles a commodity more than any other asset class, but also said that volatility isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

“The lack of a supply response to a demand shock all but ensures it is likely to remain volatile for the foreseeable future,” Cater said.

BTC’s halving, an event where the reward for mining new blocks is halved, meaning miners receive 50 percent fewer BTC for verifying transactions, is set to trigger on May 14, 2020.

In macroeconomics, scarcity tends to be a fundamental driving force that increases the value of an asset, much the same way that diamonds, oil and gold functions based on the supply and demand from speculative investors.

Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB Group, a regulated financial services enterprise for digital assets, said Kruger’s second scenario, in which scarcity continues to drive prices higher is likely to remain a constant forever. He also said global cryptocurrency adoption was a long way from mainstream adoption but said the markets continue to march on, regardless of price.

“I can tell you with great confidence that global adoption at established brands is growing steadily and purposefully,” Landsberg-Sadie said.

How far along BTC’s market cycle is, is yet to be determined, but if traditional economics prove true, BTC could be highly valued in the very near future.","Why did this happen?

At least five local exchanges have halted operations or announced they will no longer serve domestic users this month, after regulators issued a series of warnings and notices as part of a cleanup of digital currency trading.

China is stepping up scrutiny of its massive cryptocurrency industry just weeks after President Xi Jinping ignited a market frenzy by declaring Beijing’s support for the blockchain technology that underpins the sector. But financial watchdogs including the Chinese central bank have in past weeks ordered cryptocurrency firms to shutter and warned investors to be wary of digital currencies, seeking to rein in a market prone to excesses. Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like service, suspended accounts operated by major exchange Binance Holdings Ltd. and blockchain platform Tron.

Taken together, the latest wave of shutdowns and restrictions represent the biggest cleanup of the sector since an initial Chinese clampdown in September 2017. Although exchanges that allow users to buy Bitcoin and Ether with fiat money were banned, trading had remained rampant in China through over-the-counter platforms or services that deal with cryptocurrency assets only.

Now, even those alternatives have succumbed to regulators, spooking investors. Bitcoin this week sank to its lowest level in six months at the end of its longest losing streak since at least 2010. The largest cryptocurrency recovered with a 6 percent rebound on Wednesday, but is still poised to post its worst month since November last year.

Twenty of the top 50 exchanges are based in the Asia-Pacific region and accounted for about 40 percent of bitcoin transactions in the first half of the year, according to data from Chainalysis. Within the region, the most exchanges are in China, the research firm found.

Aaron Hu, a 26-year-old computer engineer in the central Chinese city of Changsha, said he moved all the cryptocurrency he holds — several million yuan’s worth — from exchanges like Binance and OKEx to his own wallet address. “The first thing I thought of is how to secure my assets,” he said.

Last week, Chinese exchange operators Bitsoda and Akdex announced termination of service. Rival Biss said this month it had halted operations while executives cooperate with a government probe. Btuex said Monday it would shut in response to Chinese government orders, reopening in future to serve only overseas users. And Idax said on Sunday it would also no longer serve users in China but would focus on users abroad, citing policy reasons.

“It appears that, like everything else within their borders, China feels it needs to have tighter controls on the crypto market including exchanges, miners and asset issuers,” said Katie Talati, head of research at Arca, a Los Angeles-based asset manager that invests in cryptocurrencies. “I do believe, however, they are moving in a similar direction as Japan and other jurisdictions that have tight and clear regulations for crypto businesses.”

For now, uncertainty over how deep the apparent crackdown will run has spurred traders to transfer their money to safer places. Tether, a so-called stable coin pegged to the U.S. dollar, is a popular vehicle for investors to move their money into and out of cryptocurrencies.

One of cryptocurrency’s largest wallet apps, ImToken, said Tether transactions among its nearly 10 million users surged to $66 million on Nov. 22, the day China’s central bank issued its latest warning against cryptocurrency trading. That’s more than double the app’s average daily Tether transaction in October, the IDG-backed startup said.

“The current situation and environment for blockchain in China is still very positive,” Tron founder and cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun said. “In the short term, it may not get as much progress as we’d expect.”

PHOTO GALLERY (CLICK TO ENLARGE)","A cryptocurrency wills product has been launched to solve the problem of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming inaccessible after their owner’s death.

Developed by cryptocurrency insurance company Coincover, cryptocurrency wills are designed to make it possible for someone to take over a person’s cryptocurrency wallet after they die.

The product is designed to resolve a frequent issue with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies: the system to retrieve them – which is designed for security – means that without the correct wallet IDs and access information, they are utterly inaccessible, unlike traditional assets.

This has led to millions of Bitcoin being lost due to mislaid wallets, a problem that the insurance industry is now beginning to tackle, but it is also a severe issue when Bitcoin owners die.

According to Coincover, around 4 million Bitcoins, equivalent to around $30bn, have been lost as a result of their owner’s death.

Introducing cryptocurrency wills

Coincover’s cryptocurrency wills service takes the form of a kit that can be purchased from major retailers such as Amazon.

This contains a stainless steel card with a unique ID, as well notification cards that are designed to be given to the intended beneficiaries or the person who will execute the will.

Users set up their cryptocurrency will via Coincover’s website, which includes setting up a BitGo hot wallet where the Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency is stored, and then give out the notification cards.

Upon a person’s death, the information on the card, combined with a death certificate, is enough to enable the cryptocurrency to be released to the selected person.

While the topic may seem dark, it is a practical solution to a growing issue.

“As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and its value continues to increase, considering how to manage it as part of an estate planning exercise is becoming increasingly difficult. Many people don’t know that unlike physical assets which form part of an estate on death such as savings, property, pensions and investments, you can’t get at cryptocurrency, unless you have the key or password to it,” said David Janczewski, CEO and co-founder of Coincover.

“There’s no bank manager to ask, and no one can break in for you. That’s why so many billion Bitcoins are lost when people die each year. Our Cryptocurrency Wills product meets this gap in the market.

As reported on Oct. 30, the firm received initial approval from the Ontario Securities Commission to launch the fund on either the Toronto Stock Exchange or the TSX Venture Exchange later this year.

A representative told CoinDesk today that the firm expects to list on the Toronto Stock Exchange and begin trading in late December or early January.

3iQ has been in talks with the regulator over the offering for three years, the representative said.

The IPO, being led by Canaccord Genuity Corp., is aimed to provide unit (bundles of stock and warrants) holders with exposure to bitcoin and the daily price movements of the cryptocurrency against the U.S. dollar.

The bitcoin fund is a closed-end investment fund set up as a trust in the province of Ontario. 3iQ will act as the investment and portfolio manager of the fund, while bitcoin in the fund will be custodied by New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini Trust Company LLC.","A good portion of the cryptocurrency exchange industry is running the risk of falling afoul of the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “Travel Rule” guidance announced in July, according to new research.

Blockchain compliance solutions provider CipherTrace says in its Q3 Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Report, published Wednesday, that around one third of the top 120 exchanges are “weak” when it comes to know-your-customer (KYC) verification, while fully two-thirds “lack strong KYC policies.”

The FATF guidance, which is more or less obligatory for its 39 member nations and jurisdictions to adopt in regulation, stipulates that exchanges, or virtual asset providers (VASPS), must obtain, store and be able to pass on data on their users when transactions worth $1,000 or over are made. This provides a digital paper trail that can be followed in order to prevent financial crimes such as money laundering or terrorism financing.

CipherTrace says there’s now just seven months left for the members to align legislation with the guidance, and VASPs to set up solutions in order to remain in compliance. However, it says, some 65 percent of exchanges are not yet able “to handle basic KYC, let alone comply with the stringent new funds ‘Travel Rule’.”

The firm’s researchers found that they were able to transact 0.25 bitcoin daily with little or no KYC at 35 percent of exchanges tested, described as “weak” AML protections in the report. Forty-one percent were “porous,” CipherTrace found, with “some sort of ID verification process,” while just 35 percent had “strong” KYC, with multiple levels of verification, including a proof-of-address requirement and perhaps video or telephone calls.

CipherTrace further says that the Travel Rule is “problematic” for so-called privacy coins, cryptocurrencies that offer features that can obfuscate a user’s personal data. Such features put these cryptos at odd with FATF’s guidance.

Already, some exchanges have been delisting such coins, including zcash, monero and dash, citing compliance with national regulators’ moves to align with FATF’s stipulations.

However, the report says that the researchers found 32 percent of exchanges, including some with less-then-strong KYC, still list privacy coins.

The firm states, though:

""Although the report does punctuate a concern for privacy coins that have no compliance strategy, CipherTrace affirms that recent reports of the death of privacy coins have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, many of the top privacy coin developers have already released statements ... on how they could comply with the Travel Rule.

Indeed, a planned suspension of zcash and dash trading support by OKEx Korea was put under review in October, partly thanks to efforts by the Electric Coin Company – the co-developer of zcash – to assuage the exchange’s fears.

Josh Swihart, the Electric Coin Company’s VP of marketing and business development told CoinDesk at the time, “Zcash is entirely compatible with all FATF recommendations including the travel rule.”","Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced in a blog post on Nov. 28 that it partnered with crypto travel startup TravelByBit to launch a rewards card that facilitates crypto payments on major travel websites.

Per the announcement, the card will function like a traditional prepaid card with access to additional discounts and rewards that users will be able to load with Bitcoin (BTC), Binance USD (BUSD), Binance Coin (BNB) and Ontology (ONT).

The card will be released early next year and will initially target travelers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Australia and Europe, with plans to gradually expand.

Traveling with crypto

The service will reportedly allow its customers to book flights and hotels through major booking sites including Booking.com, Expedia, Agoda, and Ctrip, as well as TravelByBit’s own platform.

TravelByBit is not the first service enabling its users to travel with cryptocurrencies. As Cointelegraph recently reported, crypto booking firm Travala announced that it will now let its customers reserve any hotel that is bookable through Booking.com with cryptocurrency.

Earlier this summer, the co-founders of Scandinavian air carrier Norwegian Air announced plans to launch their own cryptocurrency exchange, which will subsequently facilitate the airline’s acceptance of cryptocurrency payments.","More Than 1,000 Cryptocurrencies Have Already Failed—Here's What Will Affect Successes in the Future

With Wall Street slowly taking charge of crypto, the days of radical outsiders launching successful altcoins may be numbered.

Photo by Shutterstock.com

Many cryptocurrencies have been launched in the past few years, often to great fanfare and celebration, only to fade and fail as the public and investors shun them. According to Coinopsy, which tracks such failures, there are some 1,085 dead coins at the time of writing. That’s a substantial number, even next to the approximately 3,000 still in existence, and senior industry figures expect many of those to fail, too.

Why do so many of these projects unravel? You expect many initiatives to come and go in a fledgling market, of course–the 1990s dotcom bubble is the perfect example. But at the same time, cryptocurrency developers have traditionally spent too little time designing the business-use case for their coins and tokens, then only realizing after the launch that their idea is yesterday’s news.

Time and again, we see launches that copy a previously successful coin–“coin x is the new Bitcoin,” for example. Yet the market already has Bitcoin, and it continues to be in demand–as evidenced by the 18 millionth Bitcoin being mined only last month. We tend to overlook this problem with developers, even while we rightly criticize regulators for not being able to keep up with the fast evolution of the crypto market–despite efforts such as Howey Coin by U.S. regulator the SEC, which was a fake new coin offering designed to teach investors about the risks of putting money into crypto.

Related Facebook’s Libra Might Fail Before it Launches

No doubt these kinds of developer errors will continue. Here are several other themes that we think will have a bearing on future crypto failures:

1. Big Finance has arrived

Eleven years ago, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto quietly revolutionized money with the release of his or her now famous white paper that outlined Bitcoin. In the early years after this vision took off, many of those who launched altcoins and tokens were small teams of developers and left-field entrepreneurs. They had a clear mission to bring the world of traditional finance and central banks to its knees with decentralized units of exchange that were beyond anyone’s control.

A few years on, these bank killers have largely been assimilated by the big financial institutions they once sought to challenge. Wall Street is steadily taking charge of the crypto action, professionalizing trading with the likes of derivatives and futures products.

Related What to Expect as Cash Moves Out and Digital Currency Moves In

We may now be entering a phase where only large institutions will be able to generate profit from cryptocurrency design. It seems increasingly likely that the next revolutionary white paper will be generated by a global multi-billion-dollar firm–an ironic full turn of events, to say the least.

Many other cryptocurrencies from more humble beginnings will fail in future, simply because they don’t have the resources to compete with these huge institutions. They will be driven by sunk costs and the crypto dream to dominate the future of money, but in many cases it won’t be enough.

2. The future is stable

For a cryptocurrency to be successful, two things need to happen: there has to be a reason why people want to use it, and they have to trust it. People will generally trust a coin or token thanks to the underpinning blockchain technology, the decentralized cryptographic ledger systems on which this industry is built.

This means that the basis upon which the market judges if a new launch will stand or fall is mainly its use case. There are now altcoins in existence offering everything from new ways to fund web advertising to units of exchange in the gaming world. But more generally, in a world in which it is no longer enough to simply claim to have launched a better Bitcoin, the market’s attention has pivoted towards stablecoins.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to avoid the wild volatility of cousins like Bitcoin by being pegged or backed by assets like traditional currencies or precious metals. They are designed to encourage people to use cryptocurrency for everyday buying and selling, while also offering a stable store of value for traders on the many crypto exchanges that don’t deal in traditional currencies.

Examples include USD Coin and Tether, both of which are equivalent to $1. The fact that it takes considerable financial resources and infrastructure to make such coins operational is again likely to favor large institutions–witness Facebook’s attempt to launch the Libra stablecoin, for instance.

3. Losses more foul than fair

Many investors have lost money through scams in the crypto world. One recent notorious example is the alleged OneCoin ponzi scam, in which investors were promised guaranteed 300% returns for investing Bitcoin or U.S. dollars with a Nevada-based outfit.

The money was supposed to be ploughed into foreign exchange options and altcoins, but was allegedly instead used to pay off other investors in the scheme. Fortune magazine recently speculated that OneCoin may have generated losses in excess of the $19.4 billion (£15 billion) racked up by Bernie Maddoff’s Ponzi victims in 2008.

Somewhat different was Bitconnect, an exchange in which investors could swap Bitcoin for Bitconnect coins, which would be lent out with claimed returns of up to 120 percent per year. After longstanding Ponzi accusations, the U.S. authorities stepped in last year and the exchange abruptly closed. Bitconnect coins plunged 96 percent in value, creating huge losses, though they still exist and trade today.

Related Understanding Protocol Wars and What They Mean for Blockchain

An alternative problem is hackers raiding exchanges. The most infamous example is the Mt. Gox attack of 2014, in which over 850,000 bitcoins were stolen and never recovered. More recently the Binance exchange, one of the world’s largest, has been hacked several times, costing investors tens of millions of dollars.

One other alarming case was that of Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga, who died a year ago. Because nobody had access to his passwords, the investments of 115,000 customers worth $137m were unrecoverable. When a court-appointed auditor was eventually able to access his account, it turned out the assets had all been sold months before Cotten died.

We fully expect these sorts of problems to continue–and this shouldn’t be surprising. We are talking about a toxic combination of anonymous technology that is largely unregulated, poorly understood, and cheap and easy to move around the world–and many people willing to kiss frogs in their search for a lucrative prince.

This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.","When it was seized by U.S. law enforcement in 2017, BTC-e was described as ""one of the world's largest and most widely used digital-currency exchanges."" It was also one of the most notorious.

Billions of bitcoin and other digital currencies had been swapped since BTC-e's creation six years prior. But that was before one of its alleged founders, Aleksandr Vinnik, was arrested on a Greek beach in 2017 on a U.S. arrest warrant. The following year, Special Counsel Robert Mueller revealed precise evidence in alleging how Russia's military intelligence agency used bitcoin transactions to mask meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.

Earlier this month, new glimpses into the shadowy world of cryptocurrencies emerged in a BBC Russian Service report that provided more indications of how exactly Russian spy agencies were intertwined with bitcoin exchanges like BTC-e.

""At a minimum, BTC-e was always heavily used by cybercriminals to launder funds, so it would have been a natural place for Russian intelligence to procure hard-to-trace funds as well,"" says Kim Nilsson, a Tokyo-based programmer engineer who gained renown for helping solve a massive bitcoin theft linked to BTC-e.

""Russia's particular interest in Vinnik's extradition might suggest some important higher-ups may have had their fingers in the BTC-e pie, if not Russian intelligence itself,"" Nilsson tells RFE/RL.

BTC-e, which was basically a giant online marketplace for buyers and sellers of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, had intrigued researchers, analysts, and law enforcement even before the United States seized it two years ago.

Since its inception in 2011, founded and operated by Vinnik and a partner named Aleksandr Bilyuchenko, BTC-e's business model was heavily reliant on the criminal underworld and people and entities interested in anonymity or hard-to-trace transactions, according to U.S. and other officials.

Its website said BTC-e was located in Bulgaria, but based in both Cyprus and the Seychelles.

One researcher who tracks blockchain transactions -- essentially the underlying technology that makes cryptocurrencies function -- estimated that as of 2016 as much as 70 percent of all cryptocurrency criminal cases globally involved BTC-e.

That included what turned out to be the theft of around $400 million from a bigger, older cryptocurrency exchange based in Tokyo known as Mt. Gox. Uncovered in 2014 mainly by Nilsson and colleagues, the theft was the biggest involving cryptocurrencies to date, and helped pushed Mt. Gox into bankruptcy.

Investigators later found that between 2011 and 2014, BTC-e processed transactions involving funds stolen from Mt. Gox.

Three years after the Mt. Gox collapse, on July 24, 2017, Vinnik was arrested on a beach in Greece, where he was vacationing with his family. When he was taken into custody by U.S. agents, Vinnik, who was charged with 21 counts of money laundering and other related charges, was logged onto his BTC-e account on his cell phone.

According to the U.S. Justice Department, Vinnik, now 39, was allegedly the mastermind behind an international money-laundering scheme that had processed over $4 billion in cryptocurrency transactions, including bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox.

After his arrest and the unsealing of the U.S. extradition order, Russia filed a court order in Greece seeking to have Vinnik returned to Russia, purportedly to face charges in a case of small-scale fraud. France later filed its own extradition order.

Two years after his arrest, on July 25, 2019, U.S. prosecutors filed another complaint against Vinnik and BTC-e, moving to seize about $100 million from frozen BTC-e accounts for alleged violations of U.S. banking laws.

As of this writing, he is still in Greek prison awaiting a final ruling by Greek authorities on where he will be sent.

'The Perceived Anonymity Of Cryptocurrencies'

On July 13, 2018, almost a year after Vinnik's arrest, the first of two U.S. indictments was unsealed, charging 12 officers from the Russian military intelligence service popularly known as the GRU with conspiracy to interfere in the U.S. political system in 2016 and other efforts. The first was brought by Special Counsel Mueller; the second, released in October, by U.S. prosecutors in Pennsylvania.

Among other things, the indictments contained precise identifying information about the GRU units allegedly involved, including a group of hackers known unofficially as Fancy Bear.

""To facilitate the purchase of infrastructure used in their hacking activity, the defendants conspired to launder the equivalent of more than $95,000 through a web of transactions structured to capitalize on the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin,"" prosecutors wrote.

The indictment also provided detailed information about the bitcoin transactions that were allegedly used by the agents.

Tom Robinson, a scientist at London-based research company Elliptic Enterprises, examined the specific transactions, and in a report published 11 days after the first indictment, concluded there was a strong link between the GRU operatives and BTC-e.

He stopped short of drawing a direct connection, however.

Robinson did not immediately respond to a message left for him with Elliptic's spokesperson.

Heir To BTC-e

Within days after BTC-e was seized, a new Russian-based cryptocurrency exchange appeared, spearheaded, it later emerged, by one of Vinnik's partners at BTC-e, Bilyuchenko. Another man who was a frequent trader of cryptocurrency on BTC-e, Dmitry Vasilyev, was also involved.

Like BTC-e, the exchange, called Wex, saw hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions of digital currencies.

Months after its founding, in early 2018, the exchange collapsed amid the disappearance, according to the BBC Russian Service, of some $400 million in cryptocurrency. Russian users of Wex who were unable to access their holdings filed police complaints with Russian law enforcement.

Prior to Wex's collapse, Bilyuchenko and Vasilyev had sought out investors and patrons who could help stabilize the exchange and provide some protection from Russian security agencies, a common business practice known as a ""roof.""

Among those contacted by Bilyuchenko and Vasilyev, according to the BBC, were Konstantin Malofeyev, a wealthy Russian businessman known for his ties to the Kremlin and his advocacy of conservative and nationalist causes. The United States imposed financial sanctions on Malofeyev in 2014 for his support of Russia-backed separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine.

Bilyuchenko later testified to police investigators that at around the time negotiations with Malofeyev were ongoing, he had been contacted by officials from Russia's main domestic spy agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB).

In April 2018, Bilyuchenko testified that a man named Anton demanded that he turn over encrypted Wex assets, and the man said that the cryptocurrency would ""go to the accounts of the FSB of Russia."" Bilyuchenko later said he was held in jail until he agreed to transfer $450 million in cryptocurrency.

The BBC also published a recording of a phone conversation purportedly between Bilyuchenko and Malofeyev in the summer of 2018. In the recording, a man identified as Malofeyev accuses Bilyuchenko of not transferring some of those funds.

""There is a great suspicion among all participants in the process that you have more [money] than you put on the exchange. The fact that you were tied to BTC-e is obvious, but on BTC-e it was much more than it turned out on Wex,"" the man can be heard saying. ""You are kept afloat because I say that you are mine and I am responsible for you.""

Neither Vasliyev's nor Bilyuchenko's whereabouts could be immediately determined.

According to the BBC, in late 2018 Vasilyev sold his interests in Wex to a man who is prominent among Russia-backed militias fighting in eastern Ukraine. Vasilyev was arrested in Italy in July 2019, though he was released the same month.

An e-mail sent to the press service of Malofeyev's main investment company, Marshall Capital, was not immediately returned.

Not Just Simply Money Laundering?

Researchers and analysts have for years concluded that Russian's leading spy agencies, the FSB and GRU, were taking advantage of the cover provided by cryptocurrency and their exchanges to fund operations.

For now, there's scant incriminating evidence -- at least publicly -- that would directly expose how the money flows, something that would be of burning interest to U.S. intelligence agencies who have already concluded that the 2016 election interference campaign was authorized by President Vladimir Putin himself.

But there are also indications U.S. authorities have much greater intelligence on the cryptocurrency transactions beyond those hinted at in the 2018 indictments, according to Tim Cotten, a researcher based in Washington, D.C.

""No doubt the U.S. government, as the owners of the seized BTC-e, have much more data than could ever be hoped to be gleaned by a simple blockchain analysis about what funds were used where, when, and by who,"" he wrote in a blog post in April 2019.

Cotton did not respond to e-mails seeking further comment.

Nilsson notes, ""We've all seen plenty of indications from the U.S. intelligence community that Russian intelligence is well-versed in the use of cryptocurrency in their operations, so it should come as no surprise if they're also involved in the shadier side of the market.""

The court filings in Vinnik's case hint that one of the reasons the legal fight for his extradition has been so hard-fought may be because his potential value as an intelligence asset -- able to provide details of BTC-e's inner workings, and the agencies that used it.

Louis Goddard, a data investigator with the London-based corruption watchdog Global Witness and author of a recent report exposing a London financial company's ties with BTC-e, says he has not yet seen evidence of a link between the BTC-e's alleged operators and the Russian state.

However, ""the lengths that both sides in Aleksandr Vinnik's extradition battle have gone to -- including the filing of separate criminal and civil suits in the United States and the reported lobbying of the Greek government by Vladimir Putin himself -- raise questions about whether this case goes beyond money laundering,"" Goddard tells RFE/RL."
2019-11-29,"Ethereum Foundation staffer Virgil Griffith has been arrested for allegedly going to a conference in North Korea and sharing his expertise in using cryptocurrency.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced Friday that Griffith was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on Thanksgiving Day.

“Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,” John Demers, an assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement.

The complaint specifically cites violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The announcement said that Griffith should appear in a court in Los Angeles today.

In April, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, held the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference. According to a complaint brought against Griffith, he sought approval to attend the conference which was denied. He then traveled to the conference without permission, allegedly by way of China.

The complaint against Griffith was authored by a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation named Brandon M. Cavanaugh. He notes that on May 22, 2019, the two participated in what Cavanaugh calls a “consensual interview.”

The complaint asserts, “At the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, GRIFFITH and other attendees discussed how blockchain and cryptocurrency technology could be used by the DPRK to launder money and evade sanctions, and how the DPRK could use these technologies to achieve independence from the global banking system.”

The affidavit does not name any specific cryptocurrency, only asserting Griffith had expertise in what it refers to as “cryptocurrency-1.” It alleges that “after the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, Griffith began formulating plans to facilitate the exchange of Cryptocurrency-1 between DPRK and South Korea.”

As part of the interview, Griffith showed the agent photos and documents from the gathering and said he would like to return to the conference when it happens again in 2020.

According to his LinkedIn page, he has worked for the Ethereum Foundation since October 2016. As previously reported, he has served as its head of special projects. Subsequent to publication, the foundation sent a statement to CoinDesk that noted it is aware of and following the situation, writing:

""We can confirm that the Foundation was not represented in any capacity at the events outlined in the Justice Department’s filing, and that the Foundation neither approved nor supported any such travel, which was a personal matter.""

Griffith’s attorney was not immediately reachable.

The complaint alleges that Griffith was interested in seeking citizenship in another jurisdiction. His LinkedIn page currently shows him primarily residing in Singapore. Recently, he has been working to certify ethereum as compliant with Islamic law.

The case is being handled by the Southern District’s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit, with assistance from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.

“Because this Affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of demonstrating probable cause, it does not include all the facts that I have learned during the course of my investigation,” Cavanaugh wrote.","An Ethereum programmer who allegedly traveled to North Korea to deliver a presentation and technical advice on using cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions was arrested on Thursday at the Los Angeles airport.

Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency network after Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is maintained and collectively governed by a somewhat loose network of software developers.

According to a press release from the US Department of Justice, Southern District of New York, Virgil Griffith, 36, knowingly violated American sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) after he was denied the right to travel there by the U.S. Department of State but did so anyways in April.

Once there, Griffith allegedly gave a speech called “Blockchain and Peace” at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference in which he, “discussed how the DPRK could use blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to launder money and evade sanctions.”

After the speech, the DOJ says, Griffith answered technical questions posed by members of the North Korean government and others. He thereafter, “began formulating plans to facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrency between the DPRK and South Korea…”

Griffith also allegedly, “encouraged other U.S. citizens to travel to North Korea, to attend the same DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference the following year.”

According to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman:

“Virgil Griffith provided highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that this information could be used to help North Korea launder money and evade sanctions. In allegedly doing so, Griffith jeopardized the sanctions that both Congress and the president have enacted to place maximum pressure on North Korea’s dangerous regime.”

Griffith’s LinkedIn profile indicates that he is “a Research Scientist at Ethereum” who possesses an “Ethereum Business Professional” license from ConsenSys Academy.

Ethereum is not officially a company, but is rather a “a global decentralized cryptocurrency platform.”

ConsenSys is a private software consortium managed by an Ethereum co-founder to build “decentralized applications” applications on the network.

Ethereum’s several co-founders became multimillionaires when the Ethereum tokens (“ethers) they issued to fund construction of the platform became very popular among cryptocurrency speculators in 2017.

The Ethereum subculture can be whimsical and is informed by libertarianism.

Virgil Griffith’s LinkedIn profile indicates that he holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Computation and Neural Systems from Caltech.

The profile also features an irreverent-looking photo of Griffith accompanied by irreverent text claiming he is, “Creating the world’s finest smart-contract-platform for your magic-internet-money. It also states that he dropped out of the University of Alabama after he was, “sued by Blackboard, Inc.”

The Block researcher Larry Cermak found a series of messages sent between Nick Levay and Griffith in which Levay advises Griffith that the trip to North Korea was a bad idea.

According to FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr:

“There are deliberate reasons sanctions have been levied on North Korea. The country and its leader pose a literal threat to our national security and that of our allies. Mr. Griffith allegedly traveled to North Korea without permission from the federal government, and with knowledge what he was doing was against the law. We cannot allow anyone to evade sanctions, because the consequences of North Korea obtaining funding, technology, and information to further its desire to build nuclear weapons put the world at risk. It’s even more egregious that a U.S. citizen allegedly chose to aid our adversary.”

Griffith stands charged with conspiring to violate the IEEPA (International Emergency Economic Powers Act) and is facing a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.","German Banks Authorized to Store and Sell Cryptocurrency in 2020

Next year German banks will be able to manage cryptocurrencies like bitcoin after the fourth EU money laundering directive goes into effect. The directive passed in the German parliament, Bundestag, allows banks in the country to act as cryptocurrency custodians rather than rely on third-party custodial services.

German Banks Will Soon Be Able to Manage Cryptocurrencies

According to the regional financial news publication Handelsblatt, in 2020 banking institutions from Germany will be able to manage cryptocurrencies for customers. Under newly enacted legislation, banks in Germany will be able to receive, store, and sell digital assets like bitcoin cash (BCH) and ethereum (ETH). Directive 2015/849 is an amended regulatory approach that was issued by the European Parliament and German politicians. The fourth EU money laundering directive highlights the fact that “electronic money products is increasingly considered to be a substitute for bank accounts.” Handelsblatt reporter Felix Holtermann reveals that the new directive’s “deletion of the so-called separation bid” makes it so German banks can handle cryptocurrencies without needing to use a third-party custodian. Prior to erasing this part of the guidelines, the directive would have required banks to use “external custodians or special subsidiaries” to store the cryptocurrencies.

In 2020, German banks will be able to offer cryptocurrency solutions alongside bonds, equities, and traditional stocks. The banks will need to procure a license to offer digital asset custodial services, but the directive extends application deadlines. The consulting firm DLC’s executive Sven Hildebrandt believes the initiative puts Germany ahead of the game. “Germany is well on its way to becoming a crypto-heaven,” Hildebrandt remarked. “The German legislator is playing a pioneering role in the regulation of cryptocurrencies.” The cofounder of the crypto data aggregator website Coingecko, Bobby Ong, says that banks offering these types of services open financial institutions to a lot of opportunities. Ong explained on Friday:

Just like how banks sell gold, stocks, unit trusts, and insurance directly to retail consumers now, I see no reason why banks will not offer cryptocurrencies for sale now. What’s taking these bankers so long? It’s a big gold mine waiting to be tapped.

While Some Welcome the New Guidelines, Other Are More Critical of the Fourth EU Directive

Local reports underline that the German banking association Bundesverband deutscher Banken (BdB) “welcomed the new regulation.” “Credit institutions are experienced in the safekeeping of client assets and in risk management, are committed to investor protection and have always been controlled by the financial supervision,” the banking association said. BdB added that the new directive makes it possible for investors to invest in digital assets domestically rather than searching elsewhere for foreign funds. The CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ) emphasized after the German bank crypto announcement that “smart banks do this” and “Bitcoin [is] still not dead.” Other critics don’t find the fourth EU money laundering directive so inviting and friendly. “With the new AML law, it affects the whole EU — combine this with negative interest rates for billions of euros which are sitting in their bank accounts — Next year everyone in the EU will get a bill for holding fiat in their bank accounts,” a skeptic wrote.

Another detractor against German banks holding cryptocurrencies is Baden-Wuerttemberg executive Niels Nauhauser. The financial analyst told the Handelsblatt that the new directives will add more strain to consumer protection advocates. “If [German banks] are allowed to sell cryptocurrencies and keep them for a fee, they run the risk of turning their assets at risk of a total loss to their clients, without them knowing what they are getting into.” Nauhauser also stressed that banks already have to inform customers about the costs and risks associated with investment vehicles like bonds and equities. The Baden-Wuerttemberg analyst underlined that direct sales of digital assets will need the same attention.

Despite the massive losses recorded, Bitcoin was able to shrug off the “FUD” and continue its uptrend.

$160 million worth of cryptos stolen

New Zealand-based Cryptopia was the first cryptocurrency exchange to get hacked this year. The attack took place on Jan. 14 after the company announced an emergency “maintenance.” By Jan. 15, the exchange’s website went offline, including support and blog pages. On that day, Cryptopia announced that it had suffered a “security breach which resulted in significant losses.”

Elementus, a blockchain data analytics firm, estimated that $16 million worth of Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens were lost. Later on, the company reported that the hacker kept Cryptopia’s private keys and was able to withdraw an additional 1,675 ETH.

The month of March saw two cryptocurrency exchanges lose their funds. First, Singapore’s DragonEX reported via their official telegram channel that the exchange was compromised, and approximately $7 million worth of cryptos were transferred out of their wallets.

Then, South Korean-based exchange Bithumb released a statement stating that an “abnormal withdrawal” occurred at 13:00 UTC on March 29. The unauthorized withdraw resulted in the loss of $13 million worth of EOS. The firm took full responsibility for the funds lost as it suspected that the breach was an insider job.

Bithumb stated:

“All the [stolen] cryptocurrency is owned by the company, and all members’ assets are under the protection of a cold wallet.”

Along the same lines, Binance, the world’s largest crypto asset exchange in daily volume, experienced a security breach involving 7,000 BTC valued at around $40 million. Changpeng Zhao, the exchange’s CEO, said that the hack represented about 2 percent of Binance’s BTC holdings. And, reassured investors that all the funds would be covered by the exchange.

Zhao affirmed:

“Binance will use the #SAFU fund to cover this incident in full. No user funds will be affected. We must conduct a thorough security review. The security review will include all parts of our systems and data, which is large. We estimate this will take about ONE WEEK. We will post updates frequently as we progress.”

Moreover, Singapore-based Bitrue announced in a series of tweets on June 27 that a hacker exploited a vulnerability in their risk control protocol. The cybercriminal was able to access the personal funds of about 90 Bitrue users containing almost $5 million worth of cryptos.

A few weeks late, the Japanese exchange BITPoint lost $28 million in an attack that affected over 50,000 users. In a blog post, BITPoint’s CEO Genki Oda confirmed 1,225 BTC, 1,985 BCH, 11,169 ETH, and 5,108 LTC were stolen. Oda also promised to refund users their cryptos on a 1:1 basis.

Finally, the biggest crypto heist of the year took place earlier this week. UPbit, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges based in South Korea, reported that 342,000 ETH were transferred from the exchange’s hot wallet to an unknown wallet equivalent to $50 million.

Lee Seok-woo, the CEO of Dunamu, which is the firm behind UPbit, assured to cover all the losses with corporate assets. And, he ensured that deposits and withdrawals would resume in the next couple of weeks.

Bitcoin remains strong

Despite the attacks that some of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in the industry experienced this year, the incidents were not able to affect Bitcoin’s bullish trend. The flagship cryptocurrency is up 120 percent since the beginning of the year and is signaling a further advance.

Several technical patterns are pointing out that this cryptocurrency could surge to $15,000. But, it remains to be seen if volume would picks up to support such a bullish impulse.

While the tradition originated in the U.S., it has since spread to all corners of the Earth and always takes place on the fourth Friday of November.

The event involves retailers across the country slashing prices on a variety of goods in a bid to kickstart the Christmas shopping season. Due to the multitude of discounts on offer, the day has become the busiest shopping day in the United States, with many stores opening at midnight and facing hordes of shoppers.

The term is believed to have originated in Philadelphia to describe the heavy road traffic experienced on the day but has since been co-opted to mean the day when retailers turn a profit and go from being “in the red” to “in the black.”

Crypto and Black Friday

Over the past few years, the tradition of Black Friday has found its way into the cryptocurrency industry, with several retailers and blockchain businesses putting on special discounts and accepting crypto payments.

One of the earliest crypto-related Black Friday events was Bitcoin Black Friday, which ran six successful events over seven years before recently coming to an end. Event organizer Jon Holmquist feels he has completed his “mission” with the event, but is open to someone else taking it over. However, many other crypto-related Black Friday events and specials continue as usual.

Major crypto hardware wallet suppliers Trezor and Ledger have historically held annual Black Friday specials, with the Ledger Nano S selling for half price last year. Several cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms have also run sales, with Coinigy offering a 75% discount on its annual package, Tradingview giving 60% off on its premium package, and CoinCorner offering £20 worth of Bitcoin to new customers.

Black Friday 2019

This year’s Black Friday event sees leading crypto exchange Binance doubling its referral reward to $30 for each new registration and Binance.US offering trading fee discounts of up to 75%.

Hardware wallet providers Trezor and Ledger are offering 30% discounts on certain products until Dec. 3, and Tradingview is again offering 60% off its premium subscriptions. All of the above accept payment in a variety of cryptocurrencies. Similar to last year, cryptos themselves appear to be on sale, with Bitcoin (BTC) and the majority of altcoins down 15–20% this week.

Black Friday shoppers in the U.S. will now be able to buy Bitcoin more easily while out shopping thanks to a collaboration between Miami-based Bitcoin ATM firm Bitstop and leading shopping mall operator Simon Malls. The joint initiative will install Bitcoin ATMs at several locations in California, Florida and Georgia. Bitstop hopes to have 500 of its Bitcoin ATMs installed across the country by the end of next year.

When asked by state-operated news agency RIA, the central bank offered the opinion that “private cryptocurrencies cannot be equated with fiat money and cannot be legal tender.”

“If it is decided to ban cryptocurrencies as a means of payment at the legislative level, we consider it appropriate to support this position,” the banking authority said.

Legislation clarifying the legal status of cryptocurrencies, including mining and token sales, was reported to be passing through the State Duma by the end of the last summer session, but has seen delays. Two of three planned bills were passed in 2018, however, one regarding digital rights and the other covering crowdfunding, RIA says.

The Bank of Russia justified its support of a possible ban, saying:

""We continue to believe that cryptocurrencies carry significant risks, including in the field of laundering of proceeds from crime and financing of terrorism, as well as in conducting exchange transactions due to sharp exchange rate fluctuations.""

Recently, the institution’s chairperson, Elvira Nabiullina, said that, after research, the bank sees no strong reason to launch a national cryptocurrency that would override the potential risks.","An obscure cryptocurrency exchange named IDAX has said its “global CEO has gone missing” and asked customers to stop using its services.

The exchange said in an urgent notice on Friday that its chief – whose name was not provided – has been missing for unknown reasons for five days.

As a result, the exchange said the access to its cold wallets that store almost all the crypto assets on IDAX has been restricted and deposits and withdrawals are not allowed. “It is recommended that you refrain from using our all platform services,” the exchange said.

The announcement comes just days after the exchange notified users on Nov. 24 about congestion holding up deposits and withdrawals and that it would no longer provide services to China-based users. It’s not clear what quantity of assets are in the firm’s custody.

It’s also not known, publicly at least, what led to the unnamed CEO’s disappearance. There are signs that IDAX has close ties to a Chinese firm based in Shanghai and has a presence in the city, which has been taken tougher measures in cracking down on crypto exchanges and token sales recently.

Shanghai link

IDAX’s official website states that it was founded in 2017 in Mongolia by an entity called the Global Blockchain Research Center (GBC). The GBC’s website also lists IDAX exchange as one of its businesses.

However, public information also shows that the exchange is connected to a company called Nianxiang Group that is based in Shanghai, China.

Currently, the website of Nianxiang Group is not accessible. But indexed Google data shows that the firm’s website, before it went down, did say that Nianxiang’s overseas business unit owns the Global Blockchain Research Center.

A profile page of Nianxiang on Chinese news portal Sohu also shows it’s behind the Global Blockchain Research Center.

According to Chinese business registration data, Nianxiang Group is solely owned by an individual called Lei Guorong and is registered in Shanghai. Further, of all the 43 individuals that list IDAX as their employer on LinkedIn, 26 indicate Shanghai is current location.

Token issuance

Notably, IDAX, with its presence in Shanghai, conducted a sale for its ERC-20-based exchange token, called IDAX Token (IT), in February this year, during which 200 million IT were issued.

In an announcement in February, the firm said the subscription price was at $0.2 per token, but did not clearly say what portion of the 200 million IT was sold.

IT was listed for trading after the issuance and has since then dropped by over 90 percent and was delisted on Nov 21.

In February, the firm released a white paper – only found in Chinese – and stated that 60 percent of the tokens will be used as “operation incentives,” while the team will keep 10 percent to itself. A further 20 percent was to be reserved for the “IDAX ecosystem” and 10 percent to circulate on the exchange.",,
2019-11-30,"Virgil Griffith has been arrested in Los Angeles and is alleged to have conspired to evade US-imposed sanctions.

The U.S. arrested an Ethereum Foundation cryptocurrency scientist and charged him with helping North Korea use blockchain technology “to evade sanctions and launder money.”

Virgil Griffith, 36, was arrested Thursday at Los Angeles International Airport and charged with conspiring to evade U.S. sanctions against the regime of dictator Kim Jong-un, according to a statement from Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. Griffith, a U.S. citizen who lives in Singapore, attended a blockchain and cryptocurrency conference in Pyongyang in April, despite specific State Department warnings.

“Griffith provided highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that this information could be used to help North Korea launder money and evade sanctions,” Berman said in a statement Friday. He “jeopardized the sanctions that both Congress and the president have enacted to place maximum pressure on North Korea’s dangerous regime.”

Griffith was the subject of a 2008 New York Times Magazine profile that described him as a “cult hacker” and dubbed him the “Internet Man of Mystery.” He worked with programmer and activist Aaron Swartz to develop Tor2web, which allows dark-web sites to be viewed on a standard internet browser. On his Linkedin profile, Griffith, a California Institute of Technology Ph.D., says he moved to Singapore in 2015 because he “concluded the best place for new growth” is Asia.

He has tweeted about North Korea a number of times in the past year. On June 29, he opined that emerging multinational standards on cryptocurrency regulations would create “a market opportunity” for the isolated regime to launch an exchange. In August, he tweeted a picture of his visa to visit North Korea.

Though the charges were filed in New York, Griffith is scheduled to first appear in federal court in Los Angeles sometime Friday.

Ethereum didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment on the charges against Griffith. His attorney, Galia Amram, didn’t immediately respond to phone and email messages.

The charges against Griffith don’t name Ethereum. According to the complaint, he is employed by “an entity that functions as an open-source platform for the development of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies,” including “Cryptocurrency-1.” Ethereum has a cryptocurrency it calls Ether.

If convicted, Griffith faces as long as 20 years in prison.

The case is U.S. v. Griffith, 19-mj-10987, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).","Low regulatory risk has incentivized cryptocurrency businesses to not play by the book and still be very successful, but the 2020 U.S. presidential election may make a difference, according to B2C2 founder Max Boonen.

In a recent The Scoop podcast, Boonen said cryptocurrency businesses that decide to avoid regulations and have relaxed KYC have been “extremely successful” due to low regulatory risk, mentioning EOS and Bitfinex as examples. In September, Block.one, the company behind the EOSIO protocol, settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for conducting an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO). While the company would pay $24 million in penalties for the settlement, it raised $4.1 billion from the ICO. In 2016, Bitfinex was ordered to pay a $75,000 fine to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for offering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodities trading.

“I would think that based on history, the regulatory risk is not that high,” said Boonen. “Because at the end of the day, if you don't touch the mighty U.S. dollar at any point, you know, what can they do to you?”

However, Boonen noted that the 2020 presidential election may increase the cost of running illegal cryptocurrency businesses. As other countries like Singapore and China are pushing for more blockchain-friendly policies, the U.S. may feel pressured to retain their cryptocurrency businesses within the country, according to Boonen.

“We know one of the main contenders on the Democratic side is very pro-regulation. You know, I'm sure for proper reasons. I'm not saying it's a bad platform, but that might actually have consequences in terms of industry,” said Boonen.

In 2018, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren warned in a Senate Banking Committee hearing the prevalence of scams in the cryptocurrency space. “The challenge is how to nurture productive aspects of crypto with protecting consumers,” she said at the time.

Meanwhile, China's president Xi recently applauded the blockchain technology in a high profile government meeting. This is followed by local governments in several major Chinese cities initiated crackdowns on cryptocurrency-related activities.

The levers are there to move hundreds of millions in crypto markets, and they’re clearly labeled

On May 17 of this year, bitcoin’s price dropped suddenly. The action started on a single exchange: Bitstamp, domiciled in Luxembourg, where the dollar price of bitcoin suddenly dropped more than 18 percent in a matter of minutes. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, a composite of several market feeds, recorded a 6 percent drop as a result.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Bitstamp was, at the time, one of three spot markets used as equal components in the bitcoin price index for BitMEX, a crypto derivatives exchange domiciled in the Seychelles that operates one of the most liquid bitcoin derivatives markets, the XBT/USD perpetual swap. BitMEX’s other two bitcoin index components are Coinbase Pro and Kraken. Of the three, BitStamp’s reported volumes are lowest.

The BitStamp price drop wasn’t random. It was caused by a large bitcoin sell order, placed well below the market. The resulting downward pressure triggered auto-liquidations of long positions in the hundreds of millions of dollars on BitMEX. Traders with short positions on the exchange stood to benefit.

In this column, I’ll provide a visual blow-by-blow of what happened May 17 on BitStamp, and a risk/return estimate: if it was manipulation, how much it cost, and how much the manipulators earned. I’ll conclude with thoughts on the liquidity imbalance that caused it, and how it might happen again.

Before getting into that, I’ll explain briefly how novel structures and thin markets could make such manipulation possible.

Novel market structures

In crypto markets, it’s normal for investors to interact directly with the exchange – an ethos derived from bitcoin, which invites its users to transact pseudonymously, without intermediaries. On derivatives exchanges, accommodating this requires a rethinking of market structure.

On traditional derivatives exchanges, brokers and clearinghouses manage the risk that a large price move will bankrupt one side of a trade. All participants have an incentive to make good at settlement, so they can trade again tomorrow. On the largest crypto derivatives exchanges, it is possible to trade directly under one account today and another tomorrow. This unfettered access and pseudonymity is part of the story of these exchanges’ rise to become the most liquid markets in crypto.

To cover settlement risk, BitMEX and other large crypto derivatives exchange operators use auto-liquidiation. For example, if the index price drops far enough below an open long position, the exchange automatically liquidates that position, to settle the trade. Excess proceeds from auto-liquidations are stored in an insurance fund. If auto-liquidation falls short of settlement, the insurance fund kicks in. If the insurance fund’s earmark falls short, auto-deleveraging occurs, unwinding both sides of the trade.

Thin markets

Liquidity is a subjective term, meaning an investor’s ability to move a reasonable volume of an asset, without an undue price shift. It is related to market depth, measured by the worst price an order will hit at a certain size limit.

In crypto, market depth is fragmented among dozens of the largest exchanges, and hundreds more in the long tail. Even in crypto’s blue-chip assets, bitcoin and ether, pools of liquidity are scattered, which makes them more shallow. This situation may be worsening. Bitcoin’s bid-ask spreads have widened on most of the largest exchanges in 2019, indicating decreasing market depth according to one tracker of composite data.

Exchanges that are part of price discovery infrastructure are thin enough that a large-ish order will move the price. And, as we will see below, derivatives markets can be far more liquid than the spot exchanges that help determine the price of their underlying assets.

What happened May 17

The chart above presents a second-by-second account of what happened on the Bitstamp BTC/USD spot market in the early morning hours of May 17, UTC. Each point on the chart is the minimum, or best, ask price offered in each minute’s snapshot of orderbook data, which is provided by CoinRoutes. The size of the point indicates the quantity of the order.

The action began at 3am UTC, with a sell order roughly 6 percent below the market price and hundreds of times larger than the norm on the exchange at that time. As that order fulfilled available bids, the ask price moved lower, dragging the market price down until it reached $6,276, at which point the selling stopped. A chronological calculation shows the sellers sold about 2,905.7 units of bitcoin, in aggregate at about $2.5 million below what they would have realized at a bitcoin market price of $7,700. At the same time, over $200 million in long positions were being liquidated on BitMEX, according to skew.com. If it was manipulation, it returned up to an 80X multiple over what the manipulators put at risk. The whole thing was over in about 10 minutes.

Update: Trader and Crypto Twitter denizen Mike Komaransky pointed out that while the potential return of the May 17 flash crash’s impact on the derivatives market was about 80X the capital apparently deployed into the underlying spot market, the profit to any manipulators involved in the crash would be more likely on the order of a 2X multiple, depending on their willingness to lever up on BitMEX. I’ve left my not-very-thorough math as is, above, and add Komaransky’s math, below.

Conclusions

Bitcoin’s network security model is a fairly straightforward bit of rational choice theory: miners are rewarded for recording new transactions. To earn the reward, they must prove they have committed something of value, i.e., energy. If a miner attempts to manipulate the transaction record, other miners will likely reject the contribution, invalidating the reward. The cost of manipulation and the likelihood of failure is balanced against the reward for expected behavior.

Bitcoin programmatically maintains that balance, without recourse to identity verification or trusted third parties. However, the market structure that has evolved around bitcoin has so far failed to achieve a similar equilibrium.","‎‎‎ ‏‏‎

From a dire forecast for both Bitcoin and XRP to the Ethereum-EOS-Tron battle for crown of decentralized apps, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin and XRP

A crypto analyst’s grave warnings about Bitcoin and XRP are spreading throughout crypto circles and across media outlets like wildfire.

The trader, known in the industry as Magic, tells his 30,600 followers on Twitter that Bitcoin may trend higher in a short-lived relief rally.

ADVERTISEMENT

But after the upswing, Magic believes the confirmation of a head and shoulders pattern, which is used to predict trend reversals, will mark the start of a dramatic reversal.

Magic says the fallout would create a tidal wave of red throughout the crypto markets and hammer XRP.

“While I love XRP (and I do believe that it is superior to all other cryptocurrencies) if BTC falls to the 1000 range as I’m currently anticipating, I think XRP could simultaneously fall to 0.03. I hate to report that, but that’s what the charts suggest, if BTC falls to 1000.”

Magic also questions Ripple’s business model, saying the company would do a better job of boosting XRP if it required customers to use the digital asset for payments.

“On the topic of XRP, it bothers me that Ripple built a business model that can thrive without XRP. They could have forced clients to use ODL for cross-border payments, but clients can benefit from Ripple’s cross-border solutions without XRP. Common knowledge. I just don’t like it.

Other than that, I am a big fan of Ripple and XRP, and I think they have one of the best projects in the space.”

Meanwhile, new analysis from Bloomberg predicts Bitcoin will reach $8,000 in the short term.

The analysis is based on the GTI VERA Convergence Divergence indicator, which utilizes typical moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and attempts to identify increased volatility and delete excess noise.

Ethereum, EOS, Tron

The dollar value of cryptocurrency flowing through EOS-based decentralized apps (DApps) is ahead of both Ethereum and Tron.

According to DappReview, $10.9 million worth of EOS moved through DApps on the network in the last 24 hours, compared to $3.1 million worth of TRX and $3 million worth of ETH on their respective networks.

ADVERTISEMENT","The Cryptoworld was hit this week with major news that Upbit lost ETH 342,000 (USD 53 million). The week started badly with BTC tumbling below USD 6.7K, but it rallied 10% some 7 hours later, with altcoins moving upwards too, then it dropped below USD 7K again and rallied another 10% two days later. Meanwhile, Monero was delisted from BitBay, while if the second part of MoneyGram shares were bought with XRP, Ripple would've payed 50% more than for the first part. And while fun games are needed for crypto adoption by public, multi-cloud compatibility is needed for blockchain adoption by companies. Also, privacy coins are not dying.

As two South Korea’s internet tech giants are strengthening their ties with the traditional financial sector for a blockchain/token/fintech drive, and the country thinking about jailing crypto exchange AML offenders, the unnamed CEO of a “top-three” crypto trading platform is facing assault and extortion charges. In the meantime, first five victims of China's latest crackdown on crypto trading fell, but Goldman Sachs Alumnus believes China will eventually legalize crypto exchanges. Speaking of exchanges, Bitfinex was hit with second class action lawsuit and threatened retaliatory legal action, while Indonesia gets its (reportedly) first regulated local crypto exchange, called Tokocrypto. Meanwhile, XRP-friendly Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings invested in major U.S. based security token platform Securitize; Ghana’s central bank is considering issuing digital currency, Kenya gets blockchain-backed local currencies, and Vitalik Buterin tells us what progress crypto has seen in the last five years.

And now, the crypto jokes. Enjoy!

A fully operational crypto-focused bank based in Switzerland is expanding into nine other markets. With a banking and securities dealer license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, its services include crypto custody, trading, and asset management. The bank has launched its investment business including a cryptocurrency index.

International Expansions

SEBA Bank AG, formerly SEBA Crypto AG, is a crypto-focused bank headquartered in Zug, Switzerland. The bank recently became fully operational and started onboarding Swiss clients after obtaining a banking and securities dealer license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).

The bank has announced that it is extending service to “clients from selected foreign jurisdictions” in December. A spokesperson for the bank told news.Bitcoin.com that the selected jurisdictions are the U.K., Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Portugal, Netherlands, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

SEBA Bank aims to build a bridge between the traditional banking world and the crypto world. Its services include custody storage, trading and liquidity management, asset and wealth management, transaction banking, and tokenization. They are aimed at professional investors, family offices, banks, asset managers, and blockchain companies.

The spokesperson further clarified to news.Bitcoin.com that the bank accepts BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, XLM and NEO for its custody service. As for trading, it accepts BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, and XLM.

Investment Solutions and Crypto Index

The bank launched its investment business on Tuesday along with its index for crypto assets called the SEBA Crypto Asset Select Index (SEBAX). The bank has selected MV Index Solutions Gmbh (MVIS) to maintain the index and act as its administrator. Gentwo Digital was also brought on board to implement the specific restructuring requirements of the first investment solution, SEBA noted.

SEBAX “is a dynamic, risk-optimized index with a broad market exposure of the crypto asset market,” the bank described. Its objective “is to provide an investable index for the most secure, reliable and tradable crypto assets,” MVIS detailed. “The selection of the constituents is monitored on an ongoing basis. The index applies advanced techniques to reduce concentration into single constituents and to deliver enhanced diversification.”

According to its fact sheet, the index was established on July 2 and currently has five components that are rebalanced monthly. It is calculated daily with the constituent prices converted to USD. A maximum of eight crypto assets ranked by market capitalization are selected for inclusion in the index. MVIS has contracted with Cryptocompare Data Ltd. to maintain and calculate the index. In November, the index components are 48.46% BTC, 26.70% ETH, 18.28% LTC, 3.43% XLM, and 3.13% ETC.

Crypto assets have to meet specific criteria to be eligible for the index and must rank within the top 30 coins by market capitalization. “Stable coins and privacy coins are excluded,” MVIS explained. Also excluded are crypto assets with less 90 days of pricing history, those that are not listed on any of the eligible exchanges, and those that fail the index’s technical maturity and safety criteria.

The term “stacking sats” has become one of the biggest memes in the Bitcoin (BTC) community in 2019. Not a day goes by where you don’t see the hashtag #stackingsats on Crypto Twitter. And, for good reason.

Dollar-cost averaging bitcoin - even with small amounts - could turn out to be a lucrative investment approach for long-term HODLers. And while some researchers claim that a lump sum investment in BTC beats dollar cost averaging in most cases, it’s still might not work for everyone. Therefore, if historic bitcoin returns are anything to go, “stacking sats” may not be such a bad idea.

In this article, you will discover five ways to stack sats in 2019.

Automated bitcoin investing

Arguably one - if not the - best way to “stack sats” is to make use of automated bitcoin investment platforms that enable you to dollar-cost average bitcoin in a fully automated manner. It allows to invest a fixed amount into bitcoin on a regular basis, regardless of the price action, which helps partially neutralize short-term volatility. There are a number of platforms that offer this service, with Coinbase being among the most well-known.

To automate regular bitcoin purchases, you link your bank account to your bitcoin investment app. Then, the platform will purchase your specified amount of bitcoin using funds from your bank account at regular predetermined intervals.

For example, you could choose to invest USD 250 in bitcoin once a month on the day you receive your salary payment. This would enable you to build your bitcoin portfolio over time on autopilot without having to worry too much about volatility as you would be buying during the ups and downs. That means you would end up with an average entry price for your bitcoin trades. Hence, the name dollar-cost averaging.

Bitcoin cashback reward apps

Perhaps a more fun but still equally impactful way to “stack sats” would be to make use of so-called bitcoin cashback apps.

As Cryptonews.com reported in July, there is a growing market for cashback rewards platform that pay users in bitcoin instead of fiat currency. The likes of Fold, Pei, and SatsApp enable users to receive a handful of satoshis every time they make a purchase at a registered merchant.

The arguable leader in this market, however, is Lolli, which has just been named one of CNBC’s Top 100 Upstarts. Lolli provides a browser extension that informs users every time they access a partner e-commerce platform that they can receive cashback in the form of bitcoin. Moreover, it processes the transaction and sends you the BTC after you have made a purchase on one of these platforms.

Lolli and co. have received a lot of positive attention on social media, which has made bitcoin cashback apps one of the most popular ways to stack sats this year.

Coinmine

The recently launched user-friendly, at-home bitcoin mining machine Coinmine has recently announced that it will pay users interest who mine using their machine and leaves their crypto in their designated Coinmine wallets.

The California-based bitcoin startup announced on Twitter that the interest rates it will pay will start at 6.5%, with payouts being made on a monthly basis. This new method of stacking sats enables users to benefit from the power of compound interest, should they decide to leave their mined cryptocurrency in their Coinmine wallets. However, at this stage you might need to spend lots of sats before starting stacking them with Coinmine, which retails for USD 699, and you might need many years before this investment pays back.

Mining Bitcoin using Honeyminer

If mining is something you are interested in, another easy-to-use, plug-and-play way to stack sats is to use the beginner-friendly mining software Honeyminer. Honeyminer enables anyone with a computer to mine bitcoin with the click of a button.

Obviously, if you do not have strong graphic cards or other mining hardware attached to your machine, you will only make a few satoshis. In the spirit of stacking sats, however, Honeyminer has made our list.

Running a Lightning node

Last but not least, you could stack sats by running a Lightning node to supporting the growing Bitcoin Lightning Network.

By providing payment channels to LN users, you can earn satoshis by charging users transaction fees to use your channels. The amount you will earn for running a Lightning node is negligible compared to using cashback apps, for example. But not only would you be earning a few sats to add to your stack, you would also be supporting one of Bitcoin’s most promising scaling solutions.

Start stacking sats

If you believe that bitcoin will continue to increase in value over time, there are a number of ways you can start stacking sats that do not involve accessing an exchange and clicking the buy button as our list shows. Moreover, should bitcoin really “moon,” even a few satoshis could be worth a lot. One satoshi, which represents roughly 0.00000001 BTC, is already worth more than a number of national currencies and if things continue the way they have gone, a satoshi may one day be worth more than a dollar (if dollar still exists by then).","German banks will soon be able to sell and safe-keep cryptocurrencies under a new law, according to a report by German newspaper Handelsblatt.

Effective Jan. 1, 2020, the new legislation was passed by the German parliament on Nov. 29 as an amendment to the fourth EU Money Laundering Directive. According to the report, the bill originally required banks to store cryptocurrencies with third-party custodians. However, under the final version of the law, financial institutions can custody cryptocurrencies themselves after procuring proper licenses, and the deadline to apply for such licenses is also extended, per the report.

Sven Hildebrandt, a partner at Hamberg-based Distributed Ledger Consulting, praised the new law as a step for Germany ""to becoming a crypto-heaven.""

""The German legislator is playing a pioneering role in the regulation of crypto storage,"" Hildebrandt told Handelsblatt.

Some German industry experts are concerned with consumer protection under the new law. Handelsblatt cited financial expert Niels Nauhauser's worries that consumers may be allured by banks to invest in cryptocurrencies without understanding their risks and consequently losing their investments.

""So far, distribution was only possible for the banks through special bonds. Here, they had to inform their customers in advance about costs and key investor information. This is not the case in direct sales of bitcoin and co,"" Nauhauser told Handelsblatt.","Galaxy Digital (TSXV: GLXY ), a full-service cryptocurrency merchant bank launched by former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, has generated $58.4 million in net income during the first three quarters of this year, which represents a 133% increase from the same financial period in 2018.

In its third-quarter financial report, Galaxy Digital’s management revealed that it recorded a net loss of $68.2 million during Q3 2019, even though the firm posted overall gains during the first three quarters of this year. Over-the-counter (OTC) trading, one of the company’s three main businesses, reported losses of around $43 million.

However, Galaxy Digital’s trading division reported a 47% increase in the number of total onboarded counterparties during Q3 over Q2 2019.

The asset management division of Galaxy Digital currently has $336 million worth of assets under management, as of September 2019. Notably, $325 million of these assets belong to the EOS Fund. The fund has made several strategic venture investments during Q3 of this year, including venture funding contributions to Loopland Group Holding, Versiart, Immutable, Predictive Pop, and FinCo Services.

This year, Galaxy Digital has reportedly invested a total of $156.5 million (as of September 30), which is a $22.9 million decrease from the end of last year. The firm’s total crypto-asset holding stands at $133.5 million, which is a substantial $63.7 million increase from the end of 2018.

Michael Novogratz, founder and CEO at Galaxy Digital, stated:

“While the third quarter proved to be another challenging one for the cryptocurrency markets broadly, the teams here at Galaxy Digital continued to make forward progress across each of our three primary operating business lines as well as to conservatively allocate new capital where we saw pockets of clear value in the industry,”

He added:","This year has had more than its fair share of scandals involving crypto exchanges and their shady owners. It seems that they are not finished yet as reports are emerging of another exchange boss doing a runner with the keys to the crypto wallets on a relatively unknown Asian exchange.

Crypto Exchange IDAX CEO ‘Missing’

According to a company announcement late last week the CEO of Asian crypto exchange IDAX has gone missing. That would not be so bad if he hadn’t taken all of the private keys to crypto cold wallets with him. The exchange added that deposits and withdrawals had been frozen leading to speculation over the theft of potentially millions of dollars.

“For this reason, access to Cold wallet which is stored almost all cryptocurrency balances on IDAX has been restricted so in effect, deposit/withdrawal service cannot be provided.”

CEO Lei Guorong may have reacted to the recent Chinese crackdown on exchanges which has resulted in a number of smaller ones closing up shop. IDAX appears to have operated out of Shanghai but had head offices in Singapore according to reports.

Estimations of how much exactly was stored on the exchange vary but some sources claim it could be in the hundreds of millions. According to Livecoinwatch IDAX daily volume is over $700 million, Coinmarketcap reports a similar figure.

News of this potential exit scam comes just days after $50 million in Ethereum was reportedly stolen from South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit in a possible inside job.

Earlier this year the CEO of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX reportedly passed away taking the company’s private keys and $130 million worth of digital assets with him.

So far this year at least seven exchanges have been hacked including Cryptopia, DragonEx, Bithumb, Binance, Bitrue, Bitpoint, and most recently Upbit.

These unfortunate incidents further tarnish the industry and should lead to a massive rethink of how investors deal with exchanges.

Falling Trust In Exchanges?

Contrary to the entire ethos of Bitcoin and its brethren, crypto exchanges are nothing more than digital banks, replacing the traditional ones that everyone initially wanted to distance themselves from.

They make millions in profits from trading commissions, spreads and fees and are in reality no different to and bank profiting off their customer’s money.

Smaller exchanges such as IDAX are clearly high risk entities with all assets in the hands of usually a single entity who owns the platform. Larger ones such as Binance roll some of their burgeoning profits back into insurance funds to cover any losses.

Upbit will not be the last exchange to get hacked and IDAX won’t be the last exit scam. The lesson here is clear; the only way to have full control and access to your digital assets is to store them on your own cold wallet. As the axiom goes ‘not your keys, not your crypto’.

Image from Shutterstock","JOHANNESBURG – The South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) is planning to introduce new rules regarding the use of digital currencies, or cryptocurrencies, in a bid to stop them from being used to evade currency controls.

According to reports, Sarb deputy governor Kuben Naidoo told journalists last week that the rules would be put in place in the first quarter of next year, bringing to an end the consultations that began in 2014.

Naidoo was not immediately available to verify this, and other Sarb officials could not comment.

But local banks such as FNB have already started clamping down on virtual currency companies and last week closed all business banking accounts for companies dealing in cryptocurrencies.

“FNB considers this to be a prudent course of action following a comprehensive review of the potential risks currently associated with these entities, particularly given that appropriate regulatory frameworks are not yet in place,” it said in a statement.

One of South Africa’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, AltCoinTrader, said they were disappointed with FNB’s decision after having been with the bank since 2015.

“We are disappointed that a financial institution would succumb to international pressure like this, with banking services being denied to individuals and industry players around the globe,” AltCoinTrader chief executive Richard de Sousa said.

By currency controls, Sarb would be implementing restrictions on how much local currency can be sent outside the country.

South Africa has limitations on how much money individuals and companies can send outside the country.

The limit without declaration is R1 million, and with special application to the South African Revenue Service, citizens can send up to a further R10m out of the country for foreign investment purposes.

This limits South Africans to a total of R11m that they are allowed to send across the border, and high net-worth individuals looking to protect their wealth against the rand’s devaluation are looking to alternative methods to send their money out of the country.

This leaves cryptocurrency as the most popular method of sending money anywhere in the world due to the borderless nature of virtual currencies.

The news that the Sarb was planning to introduce such rules has sent shockwaves throughout the South African crypto asset and blockchain industry.

South Africa’s largest blockchain community, SA Crypto, said in a statement that it had previously written to the Sarb urging the regulator to adopt progressive statutes when approaching crypto assets.

SA Crypto said conservative regulations would not only hinder innovation in South Africa, but also repel investment into the country.

“The implications of the Sarb clamping down on cryptocurrency use for the purpose of stricter capital controls are far-reaching and alarming,” it said.

“With a market cap of $210 billion (R3.07 trillion) in the cryptocurrency market alone, the industry is driving significant economic growth in countries adopting such progressive regulation, due to the investment many blockchain and crypto asset companies are attracting worldwide.”

BUSINESS REPORT","Despite Bitcoin's Price Drop, High-Powered Mining Rigs Still Profit

Since BTC prices slid below the $8K price range, mining operations have been making less revenue. On Sunday, December 1, only 13 mining rigs with an average electricity cost of $0.12 per kWh are profiting at current prices. Of course, miners from China and other regions pay far less per kWh but older mining rigs currently struggle for profits.

High-Powered Mining Rigs Are Still Profitable at Current Prices, Older Devices Not So Much

Mining the SHA256 algorithm is still profitable, no matter which coin you mine, whether it be BTC or BCH. For instance, on Sunday it’s between 0.4-3% more profitable to mine on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain according to Coin Dance statistics. During the last three hours, the BCH hashrate has been around 4.14 exahash per second (EH/s), while the BTC chain has had around 98.03 EH/s. In the last seven days, BTC has averaged around 87.34 EH/s and BCH has seen 2.60 EH/s.

The past two weeks’ cryptocurrency markets have seen deep losses while BTC slipped below $8K and BCH hovers around $213 per coin. Current prices make it so only 13 mining rigs are profiting today if they pay $0.12 per kWh. This includes the Bitmain Antminer S17 Pro with 53 terahash per second (TH/s), Bitmain Antminer S17 Pro (50 TH/s model), Innosilicon T3+ (52 TH/s), Bitmain Antminer S17e (64 TH/s), Strongu STU-U8 Pro (60 TH/s), Ebang Ebit E11++ (44 TH/s), and Microbt’s Whatsminer M20S (68 TH/s).

At current prices, BTC and BCH miners paying only $0.05 per kWh can choose between a variety of 70 profitable devices. At $0.05 per kWh, any mining rig that can process more than 11 TH/s with decent power efficiency can still make money. Much larger profits between $5-10 per day come from high-powered mining rigs that can process more than 40 TH/s with power outputs between 1500W to 6000W off the wall. With electrical costs at $0.05 per kWh or under, the top mining rigs stem from manufacturers like Bitmain, Microbt, Strongu, Innosilicon, and Bitfury. Machines making below $5 per day are manufactured by firms such as Canaan, Ebang, Holic, and average around 20-38 TH/s.

Microbt Plans to Launch an 81 TH/s Bitcoin Miner

In addition to the top machines that process the SHA256 algorithm, Bitmain’s Antminer S17+ (73 TH/s) will be shipping in December. The 73 TH/s Antminer has a power consumption of 2920W according to specifications. Moreover, regional reports from China reveal that a new Microbt Whatsminer is on the way that processes higher hashrates than the 73 TH/s S17+ model. The company’s current Whatsminer M20S (68 TH/s) can make a touch over $7 per day if electrical costs are at $0.05 per kWh or below. However, a shareholder of Microbt named Wu Gang says that the firm is releasing a M30S model. The shareholder said the new machine will “deliver 81 TH/s” with a “power consumption at 38 watts per terahash.”

Wu also told the Wechat community that the M30S will be supported by Samsung 8nm chips but reports explain that the Japan-South Korea Trade War has put a strain on these efforts. Microbt was founded in 2016 by former Bitmain employee Yang Zuoxing. He was purportedly the processor design director and helped developed Bitmain’s popular S7 and S9 models. After leaving Bitmain, Microbt was sued for allegedly infringing upon Bitmain’s patent for mining rig technology. Moreover, last month, Yang Zuoxing was purportedly held in custody by Chinese police in regards to Bitmain’s intellectual property (IP). Microbt shareholder Wu Gang did not disclose when the Shenzhen-based mining chip manufacturer will release the M30S.

Let’s talk a bit about growth and potential. The two are not always the same thing, but they both are vital for successful investing. The aim of all stock investments, after all, is to achieve growth – and that means finding stocks with the highest potential. It’s natural to gravitate toward the headline-grabbing, big-name giants; they’ve got huge market valuations, and have made their early investors very happy. But there’s an unfortunate truism in the markets, based on the iron rules of mathematics, that the larger a company gets, the less likely it is to show big returns. It’s far more likely for a $200 million company to double in value than for a $200 billion giant. And this brings us to the small-cap stocks. For investors seeking the best combination of high potential for growth and low cost of entry, the small caps may be just the ticket. We’ve used the TipRanks database to find several that fit a profile: a market cap under $400 million and a share price below $10. Even better, these small-cap tickers have Strong Buy consensus ratings from the analyst community, and boast strong upside potential. PowerFleet, Inc. (PWFL) The Internet of Things is transforming a host of industries, from factory floors to warehouses to trucking fleets. PowerFleet, the first small-cap stock we’re looking at, applies IoT and M2M tech to the security, control, tracking, and management of high-end assets, including tractor-trailers, containers, industrial trucks, and cargo, vehicle, and truck fleets. PowerFleet’s 1Q revenue was consistent with the previous quarter, and included an improvement in earnings. At the top line, the reported revenue of $29 million was only 1.3% off of Q4’s result. The 9-cent EPS loss reported was a 25% improvement from the 12-cent loss reported in the previous quarter. Year-over-year, EPS improved by 40%. Earlier this month, PowerFleet scored two major new contracts. On May 10, the company announced a 4-year contract with the Israel Police for implantation of a fleet management and driver solution system for more than 7,500 vehicles of 61 different types. The contract includes an option for a 4-year renewal. Two days later, PowerFleet announced a smaller deal with Alabama-based White Oak Transportation, to supply tracking services for the trucking company’s fleet of 850 vehicles, especially its cargo trailers. Covering PowerFleet for Canaccord, 5-star analyst Michael Walkley sees a clear path ahead for the company's continued growth. “With 600K+ subscribers, PowerFleet has the scale and international footprint to compete for global tenders against leading fleet and asset tracking competitors. For fleet management, PowerFleet is one of the only true end-to-end solutions in the market spanning in-cab, refrigerated trailers, dry vans, and containers,"" Walkley opined. The analyst added, ""We believe PowerFleet has a strong product portfolio and a leading solutions platform to grow its market share. This strength is demonstrated by its expansive global customer base… We believe PowerFleet has the leadership team in place to execute on its growth strategy and anticipate recovering sales and expanding margins as global economies recover.” To this end, Walkley rates PWFL a Buy, and his $12 price target implies a one-year upside of 84%. (To watch Walkley’s track record, click here) Overall, the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating here, based on 4 recent positive reviews, shows that Wall Street agrees with Walkley on this stock. The shares are trading for $6.51, and the average price target of $11.13 indicates a potential upside of 71% for the next 12 months. (See PWFL stock analysis on TipRanks) AXT, Inc. (AXTI) AXT is a material science company that inhabits the supply chain for the semiconductor industry. AXT develops and manufactures the high-performance rare-metal substrate wafers necessary in the construction of semiconductor chips and optoelectronic devices. AXT has operations in both California and China, staying close to Silicon Valley customers and Chinese raw materials. The company holds a vital niche in the chip industry, and its revenue and earnings have been reflecting that. In the first quarter of 2021, revenue hit $31.4 million, passing the $30 million mark for the first time on 51% year-over-year growth. EPS hit 8 cents, a dramatic turnaround from the 1-cent loss reported in the year-ago quarter. Along with the Q1 results, AXT also announced its first deliveries of 8-inch diameter gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates to a major customer. AXT has received ‘significant interest’ from potential customers of GaAs products, and predicts increasing demand as the products finds more applications. Analyst Richard Shannon, covering this stock for Craig-Hallum, takes especial note of the increasing demand for the company’s products. “The demand profile from InP (optics, health monitoring) and GaAs (5G, optics, 3DS, microLED) are as powerful as any we can find across small-cap tech. With an improving customer set (tier 1’s driving much of future growth), GM that can still grow and valuation improvement potential from a STAR exchange listing in mid-2022, investors have multiple ways to win in this stock,"" Shannon wrote. Shannon’s bullish comments back up his Buy rating, and his $17 price target suggests a 90% growth potential in the year ahead. (To watch Shannon’s track record, click here) The Wall Street reviews on AXTI break down 3 to 1 in favor of Buys versus Holds, giving the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in AXTI are selling for $8.95 each, and the average target of $16 indicates a possible upside of ~79% from that level. (See AXTI stock analysis on TipRanks) CECO Environmental (CECE) For the last stock on our list, we’ll shift to the green economy, where CECO Environmental develops, provides, and install air quality and fluid handling systems. In short, the company deals in air pollution control technology, a niche that has been in demand since the 1970s. CECO provides know-how and systems in a wide range of industries, including construction materials like bricks, cement, steel, and glass; and manufacturing, in the automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical, chemical, and fuel refining sectors. In the company’s most recent financial release, for 1Q21, the top line came in at $71.9 million, just under the $80.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter, while EPS fell from 10 cents per share one year ago to 3 cents in the current report. In more positive notes, the company reported a year-over-year increase in bookings, from $75.7 million to $92.1 million, and the work backlog of $203.1 million was up 11% from one year ago. A few days after the earnings release, CECO announced that it had won a large-scale contract with a major semiconductor chip manufacturer. The chip industry regularly works with a variety of rare metals and other pollutant chemicals – and CECO’s new contract covers scrubber and exhaust systems, as well as recirculation pumps -- items necessary for the chip maker to meet or exceed environmental regulations. Turning to the analyst community, H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal believes the company has a lot going for it and a bright future. “The company appears to be in recovery from COVID-19 headwinds, with bookings growing to $92.1M during the quarter... The last time bookings were at or above these levels was during mid-2019…. During the next few quarters, we expect to see improved revenues from Engineered Systems as the broader energy markets improve. Management highlighted that the company's bid proposal environment has been improving, with order pipeline of over $2.0B, which we believe should support continuing order improvement over the next few quarters,” the 5-star analyst explained. Based on the above, Dayal rates CECE shares a Buy rating, and his $15 price target indicates confidence in a 100% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here) Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating – this one based on 3 positive Wall Street reviews. The shares are selling for $7.50 and have a $12 average price target, suggesting a 12-month upside of 60%.

2019-12-02,"A judge ruled that the U.S. Department of Justice has enough evidence to move a case against ethereum developer Virgil Griffith to trial.

Griffith, who was arrested in Los Angeles on Thanksgiving Day on charges of conspiracy to assist the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in learning more about cryptocurrency for its own benefit, had a preliminary court hearing Monday to determine whether the DOJ had sufficient evidence to establish probable cause.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York said Friday that he had been charged with “violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by traveling to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) in order deliver a presentation and technical advice on using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions.”

According to Friday’s complaint, Griffith asked for – and was denied – permission to travel to North Korea in order to give the presentation, titled “Blockchain and Peace.” Moreover, the complaint said, Griffith subsequently “began formulating plans to facilitate the exchange of Cryptocurrency-1 between the DPRK and South Korea,” despite knowing that this would violate U.S. sanctions against the DPRK.

Following the hearing Monday afternoon, Brian Klein of Baker Marquart, who is representing Griffith, said in a statement that the developer will be released from jail after bond is posted.

He added:

""We are very pleased that today the judge found that Virgil should be released from jail pending trial. We dispute the untested allegations in the criminal complaint. Virgil looks forward to his day in court, when the full story can come out.""

Klein has represented a number of high-profile individuals in the cryptocurrency and cybersecurity worlds, including bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem and security researcher Marcus Hutchins.

Correction (Dec. 2, 1:02 UTC): After publication of this article, the lawyer representing Griffith added that his client will be held until bond is posted. “This usually takes a few weeks,” Klein wrote. The headline has been updated.","Speculation is at the heart of the cryptocurrency market. Obviously, price speculation is present across all assets, but most thriving cryptocurrencies have survived largely thanks to speculation about their anticipated applications and promised potential.

Of course, this speculative quality has also been at the heart of the volatility in the crypto market. Bad actors and shady token schemes flood the space, new blockchain or contract technology is overhyped or undelivered, financial markets struggle to figure out what crypto means for them, all lead to the kinds of massive spikes and dips that the market has come to be known for.

While 2020 might not calm the crypto market down, it does promise to deliver some important developments that will help the new asset mature and provide a sense of how it might become a core feature in the future of finance.

Based on ongoing and upcoming trends in the cryptocurrency market and through conversations with industry veteran and co-founder of cryptocurrency tracking and tax software company Accointing Alex Lindenmeyer, Benzinga has compiled a list of five of the most notable cryptocurrency events, trends, and developments that are likely to shape the digital asset market through 2020.

The Halvening

The most concrete event that will take place in 2020 is the bitcoin halving in May, which will reduce the number of bitcoins rewarded for successfully mining a block in the digital ledger by half, from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. Even though it sounds dramatic, it’s happened twice before and each event saw some interesting price action. In the months surrounding the 2012 halving, bitcoin price went from less than $10 to more than $100 while in 2016 the currency surged from $400 before the halving to more than twice that by the end of the year.

At its face, halving introduces new scarcity to the market and bitcoin traders are already anticipating similar supply-side price growth as the past two halvings. However, traders shouldn’t forget that demand is also necessary in driving price. As bitcoin mining becomes less lucrative, the number of miners competing for a block will fall as will the hash rate necessary for mining until an equilibrium is reached.

Of course, expectations might be all that’s required to see an effect. “There are arguments for and against a price increase, the main argument against it being that the majority of people are expecting it,” said Alex. “What I know for certain is that there will be a lot of volatility due to speculation.”

The halving is aimed at stabilizing the supply of bitcoins as it approaches full saturation and there are no more bitcoins to be mined. After that, well, bitcoins may become rarer and more valuable than gold, or Satoshi Nakamoto could create more bitcoins to be mined so the coin’s price can continue to be moderated, or it could gradually lose value to more abundant or practical digital currencies like Bitcoin Cash, which forked off from the original Bitcoin in 2017 for just that purpose. Ultimately, the world’s first cryptocurrency still needs to decide whether its scarcity alone defines its value.

Enter Libra

The flipside of this is libra, the asset-backed stablecoin that Facebook announced earlier this year, although it won’t be available until at least the summer of 2020, if and when it clears the necessary regulatory hurdles. In any event, a lot of uncertainties remain about the new stablecoin that has backing from the likes of Uber, Vodafone, Coinbase and even a member of the Kushner family. Part of these uncertainties prompted other interested parties like Mastercard, eBay, and Paypal Holdings, to bow out of the cryptocurrency altogether.

However, the one certainty around libra is that it will have a potential user base of nearly 170 million in the United States alone. Thanks to Facebook’s omnipresence, their adoption of libra and its associated Calibra wallet will mean that users of the social network, many of whom have never touched a cryptocurrency, might suddenly be paying their Uber drivers with the stuff.

Accointing’s co-founder viewed the issue as a matter of bringing an air of legitimacy to cryptocurrency, saying, “Stablecoins are hugely important to the space. For adoption, it is important to be able to easily switch between a store of value and a stable currency you can use daily. Furthermore [libra] will broaden the understanding that money doesn’t have to come from countries. Alone, the discussion around libra this year just got people thinking about cryptocurrencies.”

Depending on how well this model is adopted — and pending the already massive scrutiny from government regulators — libra could well mark the point at which cryptocurrency goes mainstream, and other tech and finance companies will certainly follow.

The Feds Step In

Of course, that government scrutiny thing is ultimately a large missing piece of the puzzle. Two-thousand nineteen revealed a growing awareness on the part of federal agencies that cryptocurrency (and technology in general) is beginning to become less a component of society and more of the core element of it. The Federal Reserve revealed recently the U.S. central bank is mulling over a potential digital analogue for the greenback. Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service has firmed up its guidance on reporting cryptocurrency transactions for the coming tax season.

Now with one of the biggest and most controversial tech companies in the world getting in on the cryptocurrency game, the cryptocurrency industry will likely see local and national governments pay closer attention to the digital currencies, for good or ill. For his part, Alex sees the current outlook on guidance and regulations in cryptocurrency as mostly benign.

“If you look at tax rulings overall, they haven’t been terribly against crypto […] they are being extremely progressive, with countries like Singapore, Switzerland, and Portugal making great strides for crypto.” said Alex, “Their policy is undefined, but the government still wants us to pay taxes. I’m just hopeful that next year we will get a lot more clear guidance, specifically on airdrops, and staking.”

While most of the current legislation has been encouraging, ongoing experiments may cut both ways for the larger cryptocurrency market. Supportive regulations like those highlighted by Alex promise to foster growth and increase transparency throughout the industry. On the other hand, highly restrictive regulations like those coming out of China could mean increased turmoil for digital assets.

The Market Consolidates

Turmoil might be a characteristic feature lower on the cryptocurrency food chain. Because, despite flattening in 2018 as the price of bitcoin fell, the number of cryptocurrencies in the market surged to more than 2300 through 2019, according to the latest account from CoinMarketCap.

Unfortunately, fewer than a third of coins trade more than $100,000 of volume in a day. Meanwhile, more than a third are valued at less than a tenth of a penny. The result is that there are more coins in the cryptocurrency market now than ever before, but the total amount of capital has flatlined throughout 2019.

While a potential upswing in cryptocurrency interest from mainstream finance might contribute to a subsequent increase of capital, it’s unlikely to trickle down to the very smallest coins. What’s more, as greater scrutiny comes to the market, regulatory burdens and increased transparency among the larger players will likely root out those just trying to make quick coin. In any case, the market has probably reached a saturation point, and the number of available coins is unlikely to grow through 2020.

Crypto and Fintech Hook Up

The overarching theme of all of these trends is that cryptocurrency is growing up, becoming mainstream and finally finding actual use cases, rather than just hypothetical ones. With the introduction of libra, the problem isn’t explaining why cryptocurrency will be valuable and necessary soon but making it valuable and necessary now — do or die.

There are obviously questions about how transactions will be implemented across an array of ledgers or how anonymized transactions can be regulated. Part of this will come in the consolidation of the industry and the continued struggle for interoperability between wallets and ledgers. However, most of these questions will likely be answered by whoever tries first, and financial technology companies are by far the most eager to fill that role.

Explaining how he stated Accointing, Alex said bluntly, “Honestly, the answer is quite simple: there was a need for it and the current tools didn’t cut it for us. The crypto ecosystem needed a platform that can be an investor’s backend system — tracking, management and taxes all in one.”

This necessity of innovation has been an evident trend throughout major areas of the cryptocurrency market. Libra itself is (or was) stacked with members from various fintech companies. Meanwhile, fintech unicorns like Plaid and Chime have reached their valuations largely from investments by companies in the finance industry like Visa and Goldman Sachs Group that are curious about digital assets, but terrified of the uncertainty that surrounds them.

The point is, 2020 will be a put-up-or-shut-up moment for cryptocurrency. Either coins start to prove their merit, or they will start to disappear.

The South African Reserve Bank (SARB), the country’s central bank, is planning to introduce new rules to stop cryptocurrencies from being used to evade currency controls.

SARB deputy governor Kuben Naidoo has reportedly said that the new rules would be put in place in Q1 2020. With these rules, the central bank would put restrictions on how much local currency (rand) can be sent outside South Africa.

At present, South Africans are limited to sending a total of 11 million rand (~$750,570) across the border - 1 million rand (~$68,225) without declaration and 10 million rand (~$682,285) with a special application to the South African Revenue Service.

This leaves cryptocurrency as the most popular method of sending money anywhere in the world, but the central bank’s plan to enact restrictions is “far reaching and alarming,” said SA Crypto, South Africa’s blockchain community, adding:

“Conservative regulations would not only hinder innovation in South Africa, but repel investment into the country.”

Local banks too?

Local banks in South Africa have also started clamping down on cryptocurrency firms. Just two weeks ago, First National Bank (FNB) said that it will stop serving major local cryptocurrency exchanges, including Luno, ICE3X, and VALR, after considering its “risk appetite.”

“We can confirm that FNB has decided to close our account with effect from end March 2020, along with other crypto exchanges in South Africa,” Luno Africa general manager Marius Reitz told local news outlet MyBroadband, adding “We do not anticipate any impact to our existing customers as we have other banking relationships in place to support deposit and withdrawals on the platform.”

ICE3X, on the other hand, told the news outlet that FNB’s move is “conservative” and that it looks forward to “more clear guidelines” from policymakers in South Africa.

SARB's plan to bring in new rules comes at a time when Africa has seen increased cryptocurrency interest. Just last month, peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform Paxful said it had added 800,000 wallets in the past 12 months, driven by growth in African countries Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. Paxful co-founder and COO, Artur Schaback, told The Block at the time that Africa is a “big” market for the platform as users in these countries are “restricted by traditional financing.”



Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and payments company Square, has also set his sights on Africa. He recently said that the continent will “define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I'll be living here for 3-6 months mid-2020.""



The Block’s research analyst John Dantoni recently mapped out the blockchain ecosystem in Africa and found that there are 64 blockchain and cryptocurrency firms across 11 different sub-categories, including exchanges and wallets.","Vertcoin, a crypto project that aims to keep mining power decentralized, has suffered its second 51-percent attack in a year.

The incident saw 603 genuine blocks on the Vertcoin main blockchain replaced with 553 blocks written by the attacker, according to the project’s lead maintainer, James Lovejoy, in a GitHub notice.

Occurring on Sunday, Dec. 1, the blockchain reorganization caused five “double spends” to the value of 125 vertcoin (VTC) worth approximately $29. “Each of the double-spent outputs are coinbase outputs owned by the attacker and it is unknown to whom the coins were originally sent before being swept to an attacker address after the reorg,” Lovejoy said.

Put simply, a 51-percent attack can occur when an entity (or entities) gains over half of the hashing power of a blockchain network, bringing the ability to rewrite the blocks making up the “chain.”

Almost exactly a year ago to the day, Vertcoin saw another 51-percent attack that caused multiple reorgs and was estimated by Coinbase to have cost users over $100,000. After that attack, Vertcoin – which aims to block powerful mining chips called ASICs from the network to keep mining more community based and affordable – switched its proof-of-work algorithm to one called Lyra2REv3.

The latest attack had been seen coming. Lovejoy explained:

""On Nov 30th 2019, a Vertcoin miner noticed a large upswing in hashrate rental prices for Lyra2REv3 on Nicehash. This was combined with workers connected to Nicehash's stratum server being sent work for unknown (non-public) Vertcoin blocks. I contacted Bittrex, Vertcoin's most prominent exchange, to recommend they disable the Vertcoin wallet on their platform once it became clear an attack was in progress, which they subsequently did.""

The developer continued to say there’s “strong evidence” that the attack was carried out by harnessing leased hashrate from Nicehash.

“The attack was originally discovered by inspecting the work being sent from Nicehash’s stratum servers, which were sending work for non-public blocks,” he said.

Why Vertcoin was attacked again is unclear. Lovejoy said it would not have been profitable based on miners’ block rewards alone. He suggested Bittrex may have been target, but the exchange disabling its Vertcoin wallet may have prevented more double spends.","3. What could crypto, as well as blockchain, solve?

Advocates say there are many issues beyond currency volatility where crypto and blockchain could make a difference.

Aside from remittances and currency volatility, financial inclusion is another hot-button topic in Africa. Research from the World Bank suggests that many of the world’s 1.7 billion unbanked are on the continent, while 2 in 3 adults in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to a bank account.

In some ways, Africa is better prepared for a move to crypto than other continents. Mobile money has already been a key driver in reducing the numbers of unbanked adults, and the World Bank says the continent is home to all eight countries where more than 1 in 5 adults solely rely on a mobile-only account. Given how many consumers are already open to using this technology, crypto exchanges and wallets that offer fully functional apps for mobile users are set to benefit immensely.

Blockchain is also showing plenty of promise. As a recent Cointelegraph article explained, stakeholders in the region say distributed ledger technology will be instrumental in solving long-standing developmental issues and unlocking much-needed economic growth. Nigerian politicians believe that blockchain will drive the world’s fourth industrial revolution, and, for the first time, Africa has the opportunity to have a seat at the table. Fintech companies across the continent are growing substantially. Hotspots include Cape Town, where the number of startups being established has risen 23%, and Nairobi, where there has been a 28% rise.

There is also hope that blockchain technology can help bring around dramatic improvement to the infrastructure in Africa. In Nigeria, companies are working together to see whether blockchain can be implemented in a push to make the nation’s roads safer. The West African nation of Sierra Leone has been working on the development of a blockchain-based ID system for its citizens amid hopes it could enable financial institutions to verify identities and build credit histories in a way that wasn’t possible before. Uganda has also teamed up with a blockchain startup to clamp down on the supply of counterfeit drugs nationwide, with reports suggesting that up to 10% of prescriptions result in fake medicine.","The Takeaway

The European Union’s anti-money laundering directive, AMLD5, comes into law this January. EU states must decide how to implement the EU directive as it pertains to cryptocurrency.

The Dutch Ministry of Finance (FIN) and Dutch National Bank (DNB) have laid out their own interpretation. Critics say they could do irreparable damage to the young crypto industry.

Independent legal review says the proposed implementation purposefully misled the Dutch Parliament.

Dutch crypto startups are crying foul as regulators in the Netherlands look to implement the European Union’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) ahead of a Jan. 10 deadline.

The firms, which include exchanges and software developers, say authorities are subverting the democratic process and trying to right past wrongs that have nothing to do with the development of a native blockchain industry.

The Dutch Ministry of Finance (FIN) and Dutch National Bank (DNB) are pushing ahead with stringent additions to the EU’s AMLD5 legislation without disclosing them to the Dutch parliament, according to multiple Dutch crypto businesses and a former regulator. They say the authorities failed to pass the new regulations through the proper channels, which include an independent governmental body that reviews legislation before it heads to the Parliament. The Dutch Council of State rejected the new laws earlier this year.

Under the new rules, crypto firms are expected to pay for their own supervision costs and undergo a registration process. The firms see this as as illegal licensing, and point out that amendments to AMLD5 were pulled straight from legislation meant to address regulatory loopholes that were contributing factors in the 2008 banking crisis.

“We do not think it is appropriate to start as a new sector under a supervision financing model that has been explicitly adjusted and weighted up in response to the financial crisis,” crypto exchange Bitonic and crypto regulation body VBNL’s Daan Kleiman said in a translated letter sent to the Dutch parliament Oct. 30.

“Both the [FIN regulatory] letter and the spirit are at odds with the advice of the Council of State,” Kleiman added.

With less than two months until AMDL5 comes into force, the Dutch crypto community are caught arguing semantics with authorities, which claim to be following both the Council of State’s advice and AMDL5 to the tee.

Haunted by Big Banking

Banking compliance consultant Simon Lelieveldt, who has worked for the DNB and as a Dutch financial historian, said the two entities are trying to be proactive and not repeat past mistakes. Regulators are under pressure from critics who say lax oversight, particularly concerning the Netherlands largest bank, ING, led to the 2008 collapse. ING received a €10 billion government bailout, an amount it eventually paid back with interest.

“If you look at the AML directive in the Netherlands, we had this huge incident where ING was seen to be failing on anti-money laundering measures for about six years,” said Lelieveldt in a phone interview.

“So there’s a huge tendency and trend for the central bank to make up for it. The last seven years the central bank is really heavy on integrity supervision because they want to make up for the errors of the past,” he said.

ING was fined $900 million in 2018 for failing to detect money laundering ongoing for years. As Reuters reported at the time, the amount laundered was actually incalculable.

FIN is under similar pressure, Lelieveldt said, as the fraud evaluation from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) comes next year.

“They want to be seen as the best kid in class. So they’re doing everything in their powers to come across as an entity that basically implements each FATF rule to the letter and beyond,” Lelieveldt said.

The crypto industry complains that regulators are instituting a licensing regime, when the EU directive only calls for registration, which carries less onerous validation requirements.

FIN says its implementation is registration and that its has made the necessary changes asked by the Council of State. “The draft bill does not include requirements that go beyond the scope of AMLD5,” said Hayat Eltalhaui, FIN’s spokesperson for the financial sector, in an email to CoinDesk.

The DNB did not return questions for comment by press time.

Lelieveldt, Kleiman and others beg to differ, calling the registration de facto licensing. In fact, Kleiman and the VBNL go as far to say it has the feel of domestic surveillance.

FIN, DNB, and Parliament

This past September, the DNB responded to AMDL5 with long awaited guidance, outlining a registration process ahead of the EU’s January 2020 deadline for enforcement. As CoinDesk reported at the time, the guidance was well received in the Netherlands, although hints of further restrictions were raised as the DNB singled out non-Dutch firms.

Multiple crypto businesses have expressed frustration at stringent add-ons which could lead to added operating costs. Lelieveldt estimated Dutch companies, many of them small firms, could have to pay €150,000 per year to meet the changes.

Under AMLD5, the EU’s 28 nation-states required to toughen up know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures for crypto exchanges or custodial services.

While many EU nations, such as the U.K., have added onto the AMLD5 rules, the Netherlands claims to not have made any adjustments.

According to legal consultation firm Hart Advocaten N.V., FIN and DNB copy and pasted additions from the 2007 act into AMLD5 and then proceeded to deny such additions before Parliament, calling into question the ethics of financial regulation. The accusations were detailed in a letter on behalf of Bitonic.

“They’re basically thumbing their nose to the [Council of State], ignoring what they are saying,” said Lelieveldt. “They are claiming we’re doing European implementation and that’s it. That’s what rattles everyone. They’re basically messing up the democratic system.”

Local businesses minding the gap

While nothing has passed Parliament yet, crypto firms in the Netherlands are taking a risk- averse approach, with many companies declining to speak to CoinDesk publicly out of fear of reprisals such as fines.

Deribit, an Amsterdam-based derivatives exchange, has even hinted at the possibility of exiting the Netherlands as AML/KYC requirements are placed on its exchange this coming January.

“If we continue to operate in the Netherlands, we will need to have those things implemented,” said CEO John Jansen in early October on the Flippening podcast on the coming Dutch interpretation of AMDL5.

Deribit did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment.

Earlier this month, the DNB, FIN, the Dutch IRS and the Financial Intelligence Unit sat down with the top crypto companies in the Netherlands for a five hour presentation on regulatory guidance.

Attendee PJ Datema, founder of Crypto2Cash, said while he believes the regulators are putting new wine in old bottles, he remains upbeat overall, particularly as baseline capital requirements to operate in the crypto field were not proposed at the meeting.

Most of the 150 or so participants at the roundtable were small shops offering single products, Datema said. Financial authorities that typically deal with traditional markets are still learning how to regulate crypto firms.

“[Regulators] kind of accept it but because you can’t ignore it anymore,” Datema said.

Arthur Stolk, managing director at Dutch cryptocurrency fund Icoinic who also attended the meeting, would prefer one unified EU framework so crypto companies can get one license for the whole EU, rather than applying in each state","View

Bitcoin has erased more than 45 percent of last week's rally, but the outlook remains bullish with prices holding above three-day chart support at $6,847.

A re-test of trendline resistance at $7,665 looks likely. A violation there would expose Friday's high of $7,870.

Acceptance below $6,847 would invalidate a bullish reversal pattern on the three-day chart and expose the recent low of $6,515. That looks unlikely, though, with the MACD histogram turning bullish above zero.

Bitcoin has pulled back sharply over the last 48 hours, but is holding well above support near $6,850 keeping the short-term bullish bias intact.

The top cryptocurrency is currently trading near $7,330, representing a 7.3 percent drop from the high of $7,870 registered on Friday.

With the pullback, bitcoin has erased more than 45 percent of the corrective rally from the six-month low of $6,515 hit on Nov. 25.

As a result, many in the investor community, including the likes of popular trader and analyst Josh Rager, believe the relief rally has ended and the overall bearish trend, as represented by the drop from $10,000 to $6,500, has likely resumed.

That argument appears logical with the daily chart reporting a fresh lower-high pattern.

Daily chart and 8-hour charts

Bitcoin jumped to $7,800 on Friday, as expected, but faced rejection at the resistance of a trendline sloping downwards through Oct. 26 and Nov. 15 highs.

The cryptocurrency also failed to close (UTC) above $7,775 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $10,350 to $6,511.

In effect, the bulls could not preserve the upside momentum after Friday’s rejection at key levels and the cryptocurrency has faced selling pressure ever since.

Bitcoin has now established a “bearish lower high” at the falling trendline resistance.

Further, the 8-hour chart is now reporting a flag breakdown, which implies a resumption of the sell-off from recent highs near $10,350.

All that said, a bullish reversal pattern confirmed last week on the three-day chart is still valid.

3-day chart

BTC created a hammer candle in the three days to Nov. 26, signaling seller exhaustion following a notable sell-off.

More importantly, the cryptocurrency rallied 8 percent in the three days to Nov. 29 and found acceptance above the hammer candle’s high of $7,380, marking a strong follow-through to the hammer candle and confirming a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

The bullish pattern would be invalidated if and when bitcoin find acceptance under $6,847 – the low of the green candle.

Hourly and daily charts

The pullback from $7,870 lacks substance, with trading volumes dropping over the last 48 hours. A low-volume pullback is often short-lived.

Meanwhile, the daily chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and gauge the strength, is offering a bullish signal with an above-zero reading.

As a result, bitcoin looks unlikely to violate support at $6,847 and may rise back to the falling trendline resistance, currently at $7,665.

The short-term bullish case would strengthen if prices manage to clear the lower high at $7,870 established over the weekend.","Regulatory Roundup: Germany to Let Banks Sell and Store Crypto, Laws Changing in Asia

Some major regulatory developments in the crypto space have transpired this week. Not only has Germany passed a bill allowing banks to sell and store cryptocurrencies, but South Korea and Thailand are also amending their laws to better regulate the crypto industry. We also cover crypto news involving the governments of China, Japan, and the U.S., including the arrest of an Ethereum Foundation member.

German Bill Authorizes Banks to Deal in Crypto

A bill has reportedly been passed in Germany allowing banks to sell and store cryptocurrencies for customers. Starting in 2020, financial institutions in Germany will be able to offer cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, alongside traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. They can also provide crypto custody services to customers. The bill proposes eliminating the requirement for banks to use third-party custodians to manage cryptocurrencies. Banks are currently required to use “external custodians or special subsidiaries” to store cryptocurrencies. They will need to procure a license to offer crypto services.

Meanwhile, banks in Germany have increasingly been passing on the burden of negative interest rates to their retail and corporate clients. A recent survey by the country’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, shows that 58% of surveyed banks are already charging some clients negative interest rates.

South Korea Creating Legal Framework for Crypto

Cryptocurrency businesses will also soon be directly regulated in South Korea. A new bill passed by the South Korean National Assembly’s national policy committee will bring crypto exchanges directly under the supervision of the Financial Services Commission’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).

The bill amends the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information to establish a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, classifying them as digital assets. Among other obligations, the bill requires crypto exchanges to register with the FIU and establish a system that complies with the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Thailand Seeks to Become More Crypto-Friendly

Another Asian country that is planning to amend its cryptocurrency regulation is Thailand. The existing Thai crypto regulation went into effect in May 2018, installing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the main regulator of the industry. SEC Secretary-General Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol reportedly said on Nov. 25 that the regulator is studying whether the current regulation has any areas impeding the growth of the digital asset industry. She was quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying, “The regulator must be flexible to apply the rules and regulations in line with the market environment,” adding:

Laws should not be outdated and should serve market needs, especially for new digital asset products, and be competitive with the global market. We need to explore any possible obstacles.

Under current laws, sellers and promoters of unauthorized digital tokens will be fined up to twice the value of the transactions or at least 500,000 baht ($16,534). They could also face a jail term of up to two years. Further, crypto traders will be liable for a 7% value-added tax (VAT) and 15% withholding tax on capital gains, the news outlet detailed. Retail investors, however, will be exempt from VAT if they trade crypto assets through authorized exchanges.

US Arrests Ethereum Foundation Member

This week the U.S. government has taken two notable actions affecting the crypto industry. The first action, which has resulted in outrage across the crypto community, is the arrest of 36-year-old Virgil Griffith, a well-known member of the crypto community who worked with the Ethereum Foundation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) alleges that the American citizen, who is a resident of Singapore, violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by teaching North Koreans to evade sanctions. He is charged with conspiring to violate the IEEPA, which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison.

Secondly, the Western District of Washington court has denied a motion to quash an IRS summons for a crypto trader’s Bitstsamp transaction data. The judge ruled that “the IRS’ request for those records does not infringe upon the petitioner’s Fourth Amendment rights.”

China’s Report and Japan’s Tax Law

Following the blockchain hype initiated by President Xi Jinping and a subsequent announcement by the central bank’s Shanghai Head Office, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) published a financial stability report for 2019. It reveals that 173 domestic crypto trading and digital token platforms have “exited without risk” after the cleanup announcement issued in September 2017 by seven Chinese regulators.

Over in Japan, the Cabinet has answered a question regarding the use of cryptocurrency for tax payments. While the Japanese inheritance tax law allows real estate and properties to be used to pay taxes, the answer explains that crypto assets cannot be used for this purpose.

On November 29th, an official announcement on the echange's website announced that Lei Guorong had ""gone missing with unknown cause and Idax Global staffs were out of touch with Idax Global CEO"".



The exchange suspended deposits and withdrawals having experienced a run on its holdings a few days prior.



While Idax has not explicitly linked this decision to its CEO's disappearance, it is natural that comparisons will be drawn with the Quadriga affair of December 2018 when users lost an estimated C$250m after its owner's sudden death.



The suspicion is that Idax no longer has access to client funds held in cold wallets, as Guorong took the keys with him.



While not a particularly well-known exchange outside of the region, Idax is one of a number of Chinese exchanges forced to shut down as a result of the government's clampdown on crypto.



China has recently renewed its hard-line approach to cryptocurrency trading and exchanges, with the People's Bank announcing that any crypto discovered would be ""disposed of immediately"".



The news of Idax's woes follows only days after the potential hack of South Korean crypto exchange, UpBit. In a suspected inside job, around $50m worth of ethereum disappeared into the ether.



UpBit has confirmed that the losses will be covered and that all cryptocurrencies have been moved to its cold wallet to protect its customers."
2019-12-03,"Did Virgil Griffith go too far with the idea of ethereum as a “world computer”?

The Ethereum Foundation researcher was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on Thanksgiving for traveling to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) earlier this year. Griffith attended the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference in April and is accused by U.S. authorities of giving the North Korean regime information on how to use cryptocurrency to evade sanctions. He’s expected to be released on bail in the coming weeks.

Griffith’s arrest sparked debate across Crypto Twitter about whether giving a lecture with public information about open-source projects, and potentially suggesting how to use them, constitutes a violation of economic sanctions or an act of admirably spreading ethereum’s gospel of global reinvention.

Across the ethereum community, the jury is still out as to whether Griffith’s choices are heroic, reprehensible or just plain foolish. Some are comparing him to the cypherpunk folk hero Ross Ulbricht, currently serving a life sentence for operating the Silk Road black market. On the other hand, critics like journalist Laura Shin are tweeting that Griffith could only have helped the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

In a statement, Griffith’s lawyer, Brian Klein of Baker Marquart, said, “We dispute the untested allegations in the criminal complaint. Virgil looks forward to his day in court, when the full story can come out.”

Much remains unclear, including what exactly went down at the April conference in Pyongyang. Alejandro Cao de Benós – the Spanish-born DPRK booster who helped organize the conference – told CoinDesk in June that the idea of creating a DPRK cryptocurrency was raised at the event by foreigners who belonged to “organizations related to the top five cryptocurrencies.”

However, another attendee, Fabio Pietrosanti, said this week that the conference did not touch the subject of sanctions evasion, or much of anything significant for that matter.

Even before the trip, though, Griffith openly expressed interest in arranging crypto-related equipment shipments to North Korea in 2018, Reuters reported citing anonymous sources. He was also not shy to publicize his travel plans, using Twitter to invite Spankchain advisor and porn star Brenna Sparks to travel with him.

In June, Griffith tweeted there was a “market opportunity” for North Korea to create a cryptocurrency exchange without know-your-customer compliance requirements. The FBI complaint claims Griffith also floated the idea of sending cryptocurrency between DPRK and South Korea, but the transaction never happened.

‘Special Projects’

Griffith, 36, has long been a contentious yet beloved figure in the broader tech world. He has irresistible dimples and a patient manner when explaining tricky computer-science tradeoffs.

In 2008 the New York Times described him as a “troublemaker … and a magnet for tech-world groupies.” His initial fame came from creating WikiScanner, a publicly searchable database that linked anonymous Wikipedia edits to the organizations where those edits seemed to originate. He’s since become the center of several controversies related to ethics and computer science.

In 2013, he befriended Vitalik Buterin. Like so many privacy-minded technologists hanging out in certain corners of the internet, they were both young bitcoiners looking to make their mark with this new blockchain technology. Buterin founded the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland in 2014 to fund the development of the then-nascent cryptocurrency he created.

In an interview in May, Griffith said he offered private feedback but declined to join the project because it felt too ambitious, technically speaking.

“I’ve known Vitalik longer than anyone else in the foundation,” Griffith said, describing himself as a mentor. Indeed, some in the ethereum community said they consider him a paternal leader to many project participants.

Griffith said he was one of the first people to see Buterin’s early drafts of the ethereum white paper, when Griffith was still a Ph.D. student at Caltech. Around that same time Buterin was revising the paper, Griffith posted his first tweet about wanting to visit DPRK.

He finally joined Buterin’s foundation as “head of special projects” in 2016, after he was rebuked by many in the Tor community for contacting the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and authorities in Singapore. Although Tor browser users seek to anonymize themselves by bouncing traffic across a dizzying mesh of participants, Griffith collected and offered to sell parts of users’ IP addresses, requested onion hostnames, timestamps and HTTP response codes.

Griffith defended this choice by saying he felt ads were crucial to sustaining the Tor project and he hoped to sell “minimized logs” of user activity, an arrangement that he argued still offers more privacy than Google AdSense.

These days, he appears to have been looking for ways to take ethereum mainstream through other types of government participation, namely nonprofit funding and nationalized blockchain projects.

“Most of them [special projects] I can’t tell you about,” Griffith said during an interview in May about his efforts to promote ethereum in places like Saudi Arabia. “They’re kind of moonshots. They have a high upside if they work and low downside if they don’t work.”

Griffith was also a co-chair of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) for corporations. Griffith owns and operates Ethereum Research, a website the entire ethereum community relies on. Several community members have backed up and mirrored the data there since his arrest, in case the site is taken down.

Following his arrest last week, the Ethereum Foundation released a statement saying Griffith’s trip was a personal vacation taken without any support from the nonprofit. But it wasn’t the first time an ethereum leader met with a controversial political figure; Buterin famously met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2017. That meeting, according to Time magazine, led to the genesis of the petro, Venezuela’s digital currency project that Russia is supporting.

Neither Buterin nor the foundation was available for further comment by press time. The EEA did not respond to requests for comment, but Griffith’s name is no longer listed as co-chair on the website.

Twitter debates

In defense of his incarcerated friend, Buterin tweeted Sunday that U.S. authorities are needlessly “going after programmers delivering speeches” based on public information. (He did not address the prosecutors’ allegation that the State Department denied Griffith permission to travel to North Korea.) ConsenSys engineer Joseph Delong started a petition to have all pending or potential charges against Griffith dropped, using the hashtag #FreeVirgil.

Some ethereum fans are already comparing Griffith to the late computer legend Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide in 2013 after the U.S. government indicted him for illegally publishing academic research. Swartz and Griffith were friends who worked together on the Tor project. However, there are significant differences between these legal cases.

Attorney Zoe Dolan, who represented Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith when he was convicted of “conspiracy to kill Americans” and aiding terrorism, said Griffith’s arrest is a unique case because it may be adjacent to matters of national security and diplomacy.

Even unaffiliated bystanders, like Switzerland-based attorney and Iranian expat Fatemeh Fannizadeh, are tweeting there’s no clear distinction between promoting censorship-resistant technology and supporting non-compliant transactions on some level.

Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Byrne & Storm, said it’s a “teachable moment” for the Ethereum Foundation. “Every business has to be alert to a wide array of risks, and that includes risks arising from social media and the out-of-office behavior of senior staff,” he said.

Meanwhile, Shin argued censorship inside North Korea is so severe that Griffith’s educational talk could only help the notoriously repressive Kim administration; civilians aren’t even allowed access to the internet. Along those lines, Human Rights Foundation executive Alex Gladstein tweeted “it is terrible for anyone to provide technical training to the Kim regime.”

Most ethereum fans don’t seem to see it that way, however. Entrepreneur Enrico Talin described Griffith as a “man of peace” whose controversial DPRK talk was titled “Blockchain and Peace.” In a blog post supporting Griffith, Talin recounted a conversation where the researcher allegedly described ethereum as a road to peace that the U.S. government “can’t stop.”

Beyond ethereum diehards, even early bitcoin evangelist and bitcoin cash investor Roger Ver tweeted Griffith’s actions were a form of anti-war activism.

Likewise, the EEA member said he sees this as a case of the “police state” restricting academic collaboration across borders, even though he also acknowledges “none of us are trained diplomats.” He added this arrest might discourage technologists seeking to work with peers in places like Iran or Venezuela.

On the other hand, some community accounts portray Griffith as a rogue diplomat spreading the blockchain revolution.

As such, the anonymous ethereum fan from the EEA said they need to take the “larger movement” more seriously and recruit people with actual experience in politics or lobbying.

This highly publicized arrest may be a “turning point” for ethereum, the EEA member said.

“As long as it stays in the limelight, the more inclined the prosecution may [be] to make an example out of it,” Dolan said of Griffith’s case. “The Southern District of New York has historically been shown to be a leader, across the nation, in departing below the United States sentencing guidelines. But that’s not necessarily true in white-collar cases.”","A new bitcoin exchange traded product (ETP) has just listed on Switzerland’s SIX stock exchange, and it’s physically backed by the underlying crypto.

Launched by New York-based WisdomTree – one of largest ETF providers in the U.S. – on Tuesday, the new product will compete with a similar physically backed bitcoin ETP from Amun AG on SIX.

At press time, the WisdomTree ETP (ticker symbol BTCW) is live on SIX’s platform, but showing no volume as of yet. A physically backed product is settled in the underlying asset, not a cash equivalent.

WisdomTree said its Bitcoin ETP gives investors “a simple, secure and cost-efficient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin while utilising the best of traditional financial infrastructure and product structuring.”

With the product there is no need to hold the cryptocurrency directly, with the firm saying it employs “institutional grade storage solutions” for the bitcoin underlying the product. As with gold ETPs, investors in the bitcoin product will have an entitlement to the cryptocurrency underlying it.

“We have been monitoring cryptocurrencies for some time and … have seen enough to believe that digital assets, like Bitcoin, are not a passing trend and can play a role in portfolios,” said Alexis Marinof, head of Europe at WisdomTree.

The firm sees “many parallels” between cryptocurrency and commodities, according to Marinof, whose firm has been providing gold-based ETPs in Europe since 2003.

While the product is currently available for professional investors only, WisdomTree said it hopes that a cryptocurrency ETP may soon receive regulatory approval for wider access by retail investors too.","Jack Dorsey isn’t the only one

Even though the world is moving towards digitalization but Bitcoin and cryptocurrency still struggled to maintain a place in the digital world where it is easy to send payments online and corruption are relatively low with infrastructure maintained as well. The price of bitcoin increased this year due to the high demand of tech companies in the cryptocurrency, that includes Jack Dorsey’s social network Twitter and iPhone-maker Apple as well.Jack Dorsey is the chief executive of payment companies of Square and Twitter, he is now looking at the future involving bitcoin and technology on Africa and its more than 1.2 billion people. Jack Dorsey launched the crypto division of Square this year and is now planning to move to Africa for a few months next year and according to the Twitter's CEO, Africa will define the future of Bitcoin for sure. Dorsey is planning to start his trip in early November and his locations include Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana as well. There are no official statements regarding the countries Dorsey is planning to live in next year but we know that during his trip to Nigeria, Dorsey attended a bitcoin meetup and according to a report Dorsey also met some crypto entrepreneurs during his visit to Ghana. According to Dorsey’s expectations , Africa is for sure expected to lead on the new digital currency arena. If you take a look at the top five countries searching Google for bitcoin you’ll see that Africa has been in the top five for more than two years.There are so many developing countries that already have moved forward to developed ones when it includes some digital mobile payments and according to Decrypt , developing countries are expected to be the ones benefiting the most from bitcoin cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology as well.If you take a look at the emerging markets of Africa, the traditional money system is shallow which means that people will likely resist less to the technology introduced to financial systems. The companies using bitcoin and cryptocurrency including Biannce, Belfrics, and Paxful are already expanding into Africa and this shows the kind of future Africa holds for digital currency. Along with so many companies showing interest in Africa, there are also several developers and entrepreneurs that are working on various projects across Africa.In 2015, Kenyan tech entrepreneur John Karanja founded BitHub which is an incubation hub for various internet-based currencies and according to its founder the opportunity to learn about cryptocurrencies is massive as it can help young people easily access global markets.If you look at tech industry, Dorsey isn’t the only one who is looking at the future involving digital money system. Mark Zuckerberg is also moving his social network Facebook towards payments through Libra cryptocurrency specifically aimed to bring modern payments easily to different people from around the world who fail to have bank accounts. This project is very likely to be launched next year and we think this might help so many un-banked people easily transfer money to their loved ones which will perhaps leave developed regions behind too.Read next: Google Maps Beats Facebook, Yelp and Others to Emerge as the Most Dominant Local Search Tool! Featured photo: AP","San Francisco-based SoFi announced on Tuesday that its application for a BitLicense was approved by New York State regulators.

The financial technology company said the New York Department of Financial Services' (NYDFS) green light would allow its clients in New York to trade digital currencies through its SoFi Digital Assets subsidiary.

The firm, which is known for its student loan refinancing services, launched cryptocurrency trading in September. A SoFi spokesperson told The Block that the licensing process for all 50 states was underway the entire time that its crypto platform was being built, which took over a year. Currently, the spokesperson says, there are about 100,000 SoFi Invest accounts, with crypto being the number one overall holding.

""After a rigorous application process, SoFi can now provide its members in the state of New York a trusted, secure platform to trade crypto,"" the firm said in an announcement.

SoFi's cryptocurrency offering sits alongside other investment vehicles including stocks and ETFs on its SoFi Invest application, released earlier this year.

SoFi joins more than a dozen firms that have secured a BitLicense, including exchanges like Gemini and trading operations like Tagomi.","Bitcoin is in a funk. For the last two months, the leading cryptocurrency has remained within a narrow band, fluctuating between $7,000 and $9,000. On occasion, it has creeped higher or lower, but never for long.

Compared to its stunning rise two years ago, when bitcoin’s price vaulted to $20,000, the crypto market now looks sleepy. The highs aren’t as high, and the lows aren’t as low. The booms and busts have become less frequent, too.

“The overall crypto markets have a tendency to be event-driven, and in the past few months there hasn’t been news to send prices moving meaningfully,” Andy Bromberg, president of CoinList, a startup that enables crypto-based fundraising, surmised to Quartz. In October, his company raised $10 million to continue its service.

For his part, Bromberg thinks the market is entering a new phase. “What’s interesting is that bitcoin is becoming less correlated with the rest of the [crypto] market, an indicator of how its narrative, value, and popularity are emerging even more strongly,” he said. “Because of bitcoin’s decreasing correlation, there’s a reasonable chance that the next time the market moves, it will be either bitcoin or the rest of the market, not both.”

But even now, that’s as good as the predictions get. For mainstream investors, that’s not much to go on. All that’s clear is this: Bitcoin has gotten relatively boring.

Earlier this year, between January and March, bitcoin’s price also stalled. For almost three months, it floundered in the mid-$3,000s. A mid-year revival finally occurred after Facebook revealed plans for Libra, its own digital currency. The project, however, appears unlikely to launch on schedule.

Bitcoin’s highs and lows

Year Max price Minimum Difference 2016 $979 $355 $624 2017 $20,089 $756 $19,333 2018 $17,712 $3,191 $14,521 2019 $13,796 $3,391 $10,405

So, where does that leave us? In a year when the S&P 500 has delivered a 20% year-to-date return, bitcoin has rewarded speculators with a 90% return. This year hasn’t been a mania, but it hasn’t been a “crypto winter,” or stagnation, either. Instead, 2019 has been unpredictable in its own way—and at times, it’s been surprisingly stable. Of course, “stable” is relative—bitcoin is still far more volatile than the average stock.

Calling this a rejuvenation would be too ebullient, but the bitcoin market has exhibited signs of life once again. If anything, 2019 has shown that bitcoin is neither savior nor destroyer of money. As other crypto projects have stumbled, bitcoin has simply persisted. Maybe that’s good enough.","‎‎‎ ‏‏‎

From two very different outlooks on Bitcoin to new adoption for Ethereum and XRP, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin

A proprietary indicator that called Bitcoin’s big sell-off in November of 2018 and the bull run in April of this year has turned bearish.

Crypto Thies tells his 31,000 followers on Twitter that his ‘Market God’ indicator just posted a sell signal. The indicator is based on a proprietary algorithm and is designed to confirm trends while removing bias and human emotion.

ADVERTISEMENT

Thies says he’s “working on a theory” that altcoins could fare better than BTC during the potential downturn, but he’s convinced the short term isn’t looking great for the leading cryptocurrency.

A separate, long-term data set is looking far more bullish.

An analyst who posts under the alias Bitcoin Charts has released a new set of data to 8,700 followers on Twitter. It shows BTC’s long-term price action, with each year represented by a single candle.

The chart highlights the past impact of Bitcoin’s halvings, which cut the amount of new Bitcoin entering the market by half every four years.

Historically, the chart shows a pattern: BTC’s yearly price action rises for three years, followed by a year in the red. If past is prologue, the chart indicates BTC could be gearing up for two years of positive price action.

Ethereum

The accounting and consulting giant EY is touting its new Ethereum-based marketplace called TATTOO Wine.

The maketplace is designed to give people a way to confirm that their beverage is the real deal and not a counterfeit.

“The system is hosted on the public Ethereum blockchain, which guarantees that no one party has complete control, leading to increased trust in the integrity of data and enabling new collaborators to easily and inexpensively join the network.

The platform connects the vineyard and the consumer directly, through a transparent and immutable digital supply chain.”

According to EY, the platform remains in a trial run and is currently available in China.

Ripple and XRP

International money transfer company and Ripple partner FlashFX says it’s partnering with the crypto exchange Bitstamp.

The partnership will utilize Ripple’s cross-border payment solution On-Demand Liquidity, allowing users in Australia to instantly turn their AUD into USD, where it can then be traded on the exchange.

“Instead of waiting days for a Swift transfer to be completed via traditional payment methods using your bank or another payment service, FlashFX users now are able to move funds at a moment’s notice and see better results than ever before.

FlashFX’s service uses XRP to bridge AUD & USD currencies in seconds. FlashFX will deliver your USD to your Bitstamp account in minutes and you can enjoy unlimited USD Bitstamp liquidity for your AUD/USD transfers.”

What it means is that if you store your crypto assets on an exchange or with any kind of third-party custodian, you have no guarantee of ownership.

What can happen if you store your crypto on an exchange

After at least seven high-profile cryptocurrency exchange hacks this year alone, cryptocurrency users are aware of the dangers.

But it’s not only hackers that are after their Bitcoin. What happens if the exchange goes bust or its accounts are frozen by a regulator?

Inside jobs, exit scams, Ponzi schemes, and even a suspicious death made up the lion’s share of the $4.4bn lost in cryptocurrency crime in 2019.

Not your keys, not your coins.https://t.co/Hj03HEe1ML — Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) May 22, 2019

You get the message. Store your crypto safely either in a hardware wallet or in a secure software wallet that allows you to store your crypto offline.

So, now you’re in full control of your crypto assets, what could possibly go wrong?

Being your own bank is a terrifying prospect

When it comes to proper storage of your digital assets, you now get full points for keeping them safe. However, having any significant amount of crypto wealth stored in a hardware wallet, mobile phone, or toolbar extension also isn’t ideal. And it raises some serious issues.

What happens, for example, if you lose your wallet or it gets damaged in a house fire? Unless it’s a wallet with the private keys on the front and no backup, like Bobby Lee’s Ballet, you should be fine as long as you have your recovery seed. But what happens if you lose that?

Proper storage of private keys has become one of the biggest issues in the space of late. However, according to a Chainalysis study from 2017, between 30 to 50% of all Bitcoin (some estimated $20bn in value) will likely be lost and out of circulation due to users losing their private keys.

More recent polling uncovered that almost one-fifth of all cryptocurrency holders have lost digital assets due to mismanaged wallets.

According to Myungin Solomon Lee, Head of Product and Growth at Squarelink: “Studies suggest nearly four million Bitcoin have been lost to date, but the reality is this number is likely much higher.”

He continues, “Mishandling private keys is an issue that affects everyone in the crypto community and has directly translated to the loss of tens of millions of dollars in digital assets.”

With more than 42 million digital wallets in existence, do we really know that we’re managing them correctly?

The other problem with backup seeds

Let’s say that you store your crypto safely, have the backup seed written down in a few places just in case, and have no issue finding it when you need it. What then?

Squarelink’s co-founder and CTO, Alex Patin, says that there’s a custodial catch issue when it comes to that as well.

Most private key recovery solutions are “not truly non-custodial and rely on companies like Google to create OAuth tokens. Since Google is a centralised authority, a malicious employee with access could arbitrarily create access tokens for every user leveraging that technology, and fetch all the shards on hosted decentralised nodes containing PK information.”

This is why Squarelink has released the first non-custodial private key recovery for several dApps using its wallet management tool.

Currently, the company that provides easy access to multiple dApps via just one interface is providing the only non-custodial private key recovery platform for cryptocurrency and blockchain applications.

All other solutions rely on OAuth providers such as Google or custodial key-management services like Amazon Cognito.

What this means for the future of crypto storage

Squarelink’s recovery methods increase security and use familiar processes for users to retrieve and reset their private keys. Its setup allows users to recover private keys through any combination of challenge questions, Universal Second Factor (U2F), or email with PGP encryption.

“Squarelink facilitates account recovery through encrypted ‘Recovery Seeds’ that only the user can access, ensuring no third parties are granted access,” adds Patin.

“Today, there are countless threats to a digital wallet, yet so few security solutions. We must equip users with easy-to-use tools to not only keep assets safe but to also recover them should they be mishandled.”

While the solution is only available to a handful of dApp wallet users right now, it certainly provides a glimpse of the future of storing crypto.","A newly proposed ethereum hard fork may punt a key network feature two years down the road to avoid complicating ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS).

Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 2387, created in mid-November, would tentatively schedule a Jan. 6 hard fork to delay the “difficulty bomb” or “Ice Age” from going off for another 4,000,000 blocks or about 611 days. The hard fork is dubbed “Muir Glacier,” after the retreating Alaskan glacier.

Slated for block number 9,069,000, the hard fork contains a bridge between the current chain, based on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, and the Beacon Chain, or the first phase of the so-called Eth 2.0 transition to PoS.

With other networks like EOS, Binance Chain and Substrate looking to pick off projects from ethereum, developers voiced concerns on a call last Friday over maintaining the current chain’s health as the transition to Eth 2.0 occurs. Complicating matters, the network’s next major hard fork, Istanbul, is now slated for Saturday.

If developers fail to agree on Muir Glacier soon, which remains unlikely after reaching rough consensus on a developer call last week, block times will continue to move upwards, restricting the current network’s capabilities as transaction fees crowd out users.

The difficulty bomb, explained

A piece of code embedded in 2015, the difficulty bomb is one of two components which gradually increases the hashing difficulty on the ethereum blockchain, meant to force the network towards PoS with the Serenity network overhaul, currently slated for 2021.

Similar to bitcoin, ethereum features a mining difficulty adjustment scheme to control the output of ether rewards for mining on the network, of which the bomb is a part of.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum’s difficulty bomb increases the time it takes to mine a block – typically between 10 and 20 seconds – every 100,000 blocks. Since the difficulty bomb is based on when blocks are mined, knowing when the network will feel the effects is more art than science.

EIP 2387 would be the third time since 2015 the bomb’s fuse has been extended, first by 3 million blocks in the 2018 Byzantium hard fork and then by another 2 million blocks in the February 2019 Constantinople hard fork.

Source: TrueBlocks, LLC

High settlement times are not alien to ethereum. As data provider Etherscan shows, block times soared before both the Byzantium and Constantinople hard forks, hitting over 30 and 20 seconds, respectively.

“It looks like given faster block times since Constantinople, it was a bit underestimated on when [high transaction fees] would hit again,” ethereum developer Eric Conner said in a private message. “People were under the assumption we had until the next fork after Istanbul, but actually it’s slowly kicking in now.”

In light of the earlier-than-expected uptick, Conner drafted EIP 2384, the Istanbul/Berlin Difficulty Bomb Delay, included in EIP 2387. In a little over six weeks, block times have increased from 13.1 to 14.3 seconds, Conner said. And, as the difficulty bomb is an exponential feature of ethereum, a one-second change has large implications down the road.

Keeping up with the network

Although an original feature of ethereum, some developers have called for getting rid of the difficulty bomb altogether. After all, it has been punted every time it becomes inconvenient.

Some see the logic in maintaining the original design, however. It does force ethereum clients to keep up to date with the network or face increasing costs to run on the network.

“The strongest argument for keeping some kind of expiry is to ensure that there is no option for ‘do nothing,’” ethereum developer Micah Zoltu said in a private message.

“The issue is more around stakeholders just simply no longer paying attention and not upgrading their clients,” he said. “The bomb is about ensuring people have to make a conscious decision to fork in the face of regular network upgrades.”

For now, EIP 2384 currently stands on last call for comment among ethereum developers. EIP 2387 reached rough consensus in last Friday’s call, but awaits both finalization of EIP 2384 and acceptance by ethereum clients such as Parity or Geth before network implementation."
2019-12-04,"If “digital gold” means “a safe-haven asset where investors park their money during financial market turmoil,” then bitcoin doesn’t fit the bill as well as it used to.

For most of the year, bitcoin’s price showed a modestly negative correlation with the S&P 500. In other words, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization tended to rise on days when the bellwether stock-market index fell, and vice versa.

But since early October, that relationship has weakened, according to information provided by Digital Assets Data.

The correlation, once well into the negative 20-30 range, is now beginning to flatten towards a reading of around negative 10 percent, as shown in the chart below.

The closer to zero or a positive correlation with the stock market that bitcoin gets, the harder it is to paint the digital asset as a port in the storm.

“The negative correlation has supported the store of value/digital gold thesis for BTC as investors may have been moving into the asset as a hedge against global economic turmoil,” said Kevin Kaltenbacher, Data Scientist of Digital Assets Data. “These recent developments potentially present some challenges to that narrative.”

A major critic of the co-variance argument, Alex Kruger, a macro cryptocurrency analyst, took to Twitter to offer his sarcastic take, referring to both the stock and foreign exchange markets and their relationship with bitcoin.

“Now that the ‘Stocks drive bitcoin higher’ meme has been proven wrong once again, this is a good time for the ‘CNH [Chinese Yuan Offshore] hedging drives bitcoin higher’ meme to make it back to the stage,” Kruger said.

Bitcoin still up on the year

Safe haven or not, bitcoin’s price remains significantly up since the year began.

Early Wednesday UTC time, it was up 94 percent up from the price of $3,689 witnessed Jan. 1, CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index shows.

At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands for $7,140 and is down 48.5 percent from its 2019 high at $13,880, witnessed June 26.

So even if bitcoin may not qualify as digital gold, long-term holders have nothing to fear from the price volatility bitcoin is currently experiencing, said Eddie Alfred, co-founder of Digitial Assets Data.

This period is an anomaly, he said.

“Observing 29-day periods since the genesis of bitcoin, we have seen 195 days where BTC has been down 25 percent or more from its recent high. That means the market has faced similar conditions on about 5 percent of days in BTC’s history,” Alfred said.","Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has partnered with cryptocurrency gift cards provider Bitrefill to allow users to shop with bitcoin (BTC) and pay with the Lightning Network.

Using bitcoin from their wallets, Bitfinex customers will be able to shop from Bitrefill's catalog of over 2000 digital gift cards and mobile phone refill options, according to an announcement shared with The Block on Wednesday. The gift cards include gaming, dining, entertainment (e.g. Netflix), and travel categories.

Once users pay with bitcoin, Bitfinex and Bitrefill will automatically settle payments using the Lightning Network, a second layer payments protocol enabling ultra-fast and cheaper transactions on top of the bitcoin blockchain. This will eliminate the need for business-to-business (B2B) credit term relationships, said Sweden-based Bitrefill.

“This collaboration signals a new era for Bitcoin commerce. We will continue to work closely with Bitfinex and other businesses to develop Lightning solutions and products that make living on crypto a reality, eventually removing dependability on fiat rails,” said John Carvalho, chief communications officer at Bitrefill.

When asked for any plans in progress for tie-ups with other exchanges, Carvalho told The Block that Bitrefill hasn’t officially partnered with any other cryptocurrency exchanges yet, but once it gives the Bitfinex set up “some time to polish, we will begin work to add more.”

“Exchanges are not the only category of collaboration we are working on, and we intend to onboard other players to Lightning and shopping features in Q1 2020,” he added.

On the partnership, Bitfinex’s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino, said: “Bitcoin's use as a means of payment represents an important milestone in the inevitable journey towards mass adoption. This is why the Lightning Network is so important.”

Just yesterday, Bitfinex also added support for bitcoin deposits and withdrawals on the Lightning Network, becoming the first major cryptocurrency exchange to do so. Bitrefill is providing Bitfinex support for the Lightning Network deposits/withdrawals. “Behind the scenes, we'll be using fat channel subnetworks, custom implementations, and dynamic settlements to power a new economy,” Bitrefill said at the time.



Bitfinex is also working to bring its stablecoins Tether (USDT) and Tether Gold onto the Lightning Network, Ardoino told The Block at the time.



Sources familiar with matter recently told The Block that Kraken exchange is also working on to bring bitcoin deposits and withdrawals on the Lightning Network.","Cryptocurrency Exchanges Are Fighting to Escape Binance’s Shadow

It’s impossible to assess the cryptocurrency landscape without considering Binance. It looms large over the industry, dictating trends, soaking up liquidity, and compelling new exchanges to fight tooth and nail for market share. Most exchanges aren’t gunning to become the next Binance. But they must all exist in its shadow while striving to carve a niche of their own.

Also read: New List Claims 1.9 Million Bitcoin Held by Centralized Exchanges

Binance Is a Giant That Won’t Stop Growing

This week, a new exchange ranking system revealed that 1.9 million BTC worth around $14 billion is stored on centralized exchanges. A good chunk of that resides with Binance, where 2.5 million trades are conducted daily. Earlier this year Binance made headlines when it moved $1.3 billion of BTC in a single transaction. Its spot exchange dwarfs the competition, though its futures exchange which launched in September still lags behind the market leaders.

Barely a day seems to go by without Binance rolling out a new product or feature. This week, for instance, it announced zero-fee tezos staking. The move was seen as a direct challenge to custodians such as Coinbase, which charges 25%, and Gate.io which charges 33%. “Staking will become a user acquisition service similar to what Coinbase Earn is doing,” ventured The Block’s Larry Cermak. “Exchanges will eat the costs to attract new customers.”

New Exchanges Are Having to Get Creative

New exchanges looking to lure customers from giants such as Binance, Coinbase, and Huobi face a dilemma: should they emulate the formula that’s worked so well for Binance, or chart a different path and pray their boldness pays off?

Stormgain is a new crypto exchange that finds itself in this unenviable position. Its CEO Alex Althausen told news.Bitcoin.com that exchanges that replicate the status quo are setting themselves up to fail, saying: “The market doesn’t need another dozen Binance or Coinbase clones. There’s nothing wrong with introducing features that have proven to be successful elsewhere, but your exchange needs to have a USP that will enable it to make a name for itself.”

“With Stormgain, we’ve focused on giving traders tools that will empower them to make smarter decisions, and to ultimately increase their profitability. This includes things like free demo accounts to simulate trading, including the use of margin with up to 100x leverage, and trading signals for specific cryptocurrencies, which are directly integrated into the trading platform.”

Emirex is Dubai-headquartered Digital Commodities Exchange for trading tokenized commodities. Its co-founder Irina Heaver told news.Bitcoin.com that there is still room for emerging exchanges to prosper through focusing on the needs of regional investors. “There will always be a need for global exchanges,” she said, “but they will struggle to adapt to meet the needs of traders in specific jurisdictions. We’ve found through listening to the concerns of our customers that there’s a demand for services that cater to their technical ability, product familiarity, languages and fiat currency requirements.”

“Localization and understanding the uniqueness of the local markets is the key. From liaising with businesses in the Middle East, and fielding demand for tokenized representations of traditional assets such as commodities, for instance, we’ve been able to create a platform that’s tailor-made for that, and are now expanding into trading tokenized bonds and sharia compliant sukuks. This is something which international exchanges simply aren’t equipped to do.”

Has Binance Become Too Big to Fail?

Four days ago, Upbit became the seventh major exchange to be hacked this year when $50 million was drained from its ETH cold wallet. In May, Binance suffered a similar fate, losing $40 million of cryptocurrency. That was small change to the exchange, but given the amount of cryptocurrency it holds, including staking and lending assets, it remains a prime target for attackers. Binance has since tightened up its procedures, but if lightning were to strike twice and strike harder, the crypto market would react accordingly.

The ideal solution is for users to store more of their crypto in noncustodial wallets and for decentralized exchanges to improve to the point where they can compete with CEXs. For now, the best that can be hoped is for traders to avoid putting all their eggs in one basket. Smaller exchanges carry their own security trade-offs, naturally, and it will take time for newer entrants to build up trust and liquidity.

Of course, it’s easy to criticize the king. Centralization concerns aside, Binance is widely regarded as a net good for the cryptosphere, having improved the landscape in a wealth of ways. Nevertheless, bitcoiners have reason to remain wary of exchanges that become “too big to fail.” Years ago, another exchange held that mantle. Its name was Mt. Gox.

Discovered by malware researcher Dinesh Devadoss, the malicious code is believed to have been developed by the notorious North Korean hacking group Lazarus, Bleeping Computer reports on Wednesday.

The software was found on a website with the address “unioncrypto.vip” and claiming to offer a “smart cryptocurrency arbitrage trading platform,” according to the report, however no download links are live on the site.

Of concern to researchers, the variant is able to pull a payload from a remote location and run it in memory, making it harder to conduct forensic analysis. So far, the malware can be detected by very few virus detection engines, with only five raising an alert when the Bleeping Computer report was published.

The malicious package has no certificate, however, and raises an alert from macOS. Further, while the remote server is active, there is not yet any payload present. Those factors may mean the malware was found before the hackers were able to complete the trap, presumably aimed at crypto holders.

Another researcher, Patrick Wardle, said that there are “clear overlaps” between this new malware threat and another recently attributed to Lazarus. A malware variant found in October, attributed to the hacking group, was also hidden on a fake crypto trading site.

Bleeping Computer also cites another instance, discovered by Kapersky and attributed to Lazarus, that used a cryptocurrency trading app to deploy Mac malware.

In September, the U.S. sanctioned three North Korean entities for cyber crimes, citing cryptocurrency thefts as one of the reasons behind the move.","Would you get a tattoo of your employer’s logo?

Gareth Li, head of business development and partnerships at Binance X, had the crypto exchange’s angular diamond etched on his arm to match founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s ink. And a similar level of commitment extends to the charismatic CZ’s fans, who get their own Binance tattoos, sometimes permanently.

Cryptocurrency has strayed from its roots in the decade since a mysterious programmer (whose identity remains unknown, and to most users unimportant) invented a new form of anonymous digital cash. Today, cults of personality and public histrionics define the sector. And the stakes are often higher than getting inked like an idol.

Industry dynamics are “getting very personal,” as one Chinese investor, who did not want to be identified, put it.

CMT Digital’s head of trading, Brad Koeppen, agreed. Cryptocurrency markets are almost uniquely vulnerable to gossip and sentiment swings, he said. The correlation between public personas and trading activity isn’t always apparent from public exchange data, especially for tokens with identifiable figureheads like Binance’s BNB (CZ) and Tron’s TRX (founder Justin Sun), Koeppen said.

“It’s a little bit more relationship-driven at this point” than traditional markets, he said. “That has to do with the number of entities that are involved.”

Meme wars spawned last month over media coverage of Binance’s operations in China offered a salient example of celebrity token politics.

When news outlet The Block published an article on Nov. 21 with an unnamed witness claiming Chinese police conducted a “raid” on Binance’s Shanghai office, the Twitter feud escalated to near-nuclear proportions. The price of BNB also continued a downward slide from roughly $17 to below $15 the next day.

Social media chatter routinely sways crypto price movements. For example, in July the news of TRX creator Justin Sun’s thwarted Warren Buffett lunch also influenced market activity, Koeppen said. He described this as a widespread issue faced by cryptocurrencies with prominent founders.

“It’s hard to know when Joe Lubin or Vitalik Buterin will say something, or when Justin Sun will get in trouble. The market reacts quickly,” he said.

These cults of personality harness fans and followers to influence the market by defining the public narrative. And the entrepreneurs themselves encourage grassroots marketing by using retail investors as foot soldiers. In seemingly rare circumstances, some founders even offer monetary rewards.

Meet Tommy Mustache

The day The Block published its “raid” report, Binance’s Zhao tweeted that he would devote 100 bitcoin to an anti-FUD fund. FUD, or “fear, uncertainty and doubt,” is the rallying cry of crypto fans aggrieved by anything that doesn’t sing the praises of their favored token. Sun, who is now also a Poloniex investor, tweeted that he would personally donate 100 bitcoin to Zhao’s “FUD fighting fund.”

Beyond the anti-FUD fund, Sun also announced that he was sending $1,000 worth of USDT to a self-taught trader now living in Silicon Valley, known on Twitter as “Tommy Mustache,” to help him make derogatory memes shaming The Block’s staff for failing to apologize for a sensationalist article. (Mustache confirmed to CoinDesk that he received Sun’s payment.)

As a passionate holder of both BNB and TRX, Mustache said several people in his Telegram groups sold their BNB after The Block report because they feared Zhao may be arrested or otherwise penalized.

“Investors like me are getting hurt [by rumors] and we are sick of it,” Mustache said.

To be clear, so far little evidence suggests there was a police “raid,” and that phrasing was later changed by The Block to “visit.” There does, however, appear to be ongoing changes related to how and where China-based Binance staffers operate. Even if Chinese authorities are taking a close look at various offices affiliated with the exchange, that doesn’t imply any such visit would be disciplinary.

Still, Zhao later denied the existence of any Binance office in Shanghai since 2017, which strained credulity given the fact that employees were working in that area. When asked if he believes Zhao and Sun’s personal reputations give the tokens he owns their value, Mustache said that was “above his pay grade” and declined to comment on whether he would sell if anything happened to Zhao personally.

Regardless, Zhao’s rivals and former coworkers at the Asian OKEx exchange promoted this headline feud while spreading other accusations of dishonesty and unethical behavior by Zhao personally. (In Chinese social media groups, sexist criticism of Binance co-founder and fellow OKEx alum He Yi took a dark turn that has, fortunately, not made its way to Crypto Twitter.)

In short, Mustache worried negative headlines and Twitter feuds were impacting the value of his holdings.

That’s why he’s using the money from Sun to pay a graphic designer in Romania who makes reporter-bashing memes, in addition to thousands of dollars from Mustache’s own money. The funds are distributed to followers who share memes or contribute their own, following the giveaway format Sun often uses for the TRX community.

Mustache, who said he never received money from either founder before this incident, met Zhao in person over Thanksgiving weekend. Zhao likened their burgeoning bromance to a first date as the BNB holders’ meme-making crusade raged on. On Dec. 2, Mustache retweeted a call to “protect our investments” by discrediting FUD. (Binance denied contributing any money to this meme war.)

FUD according to whom?

As this case illustrates, what qualifies as FUD is generally defined by crypto celebrities.

In many cases, bombastic tweets and public announcements from token founders appear to surf the gray area between misrepresentation and optimism.

“This space is so young and immature, compared to what the business norms are,” said attorney Nelson Rosario, who specializes in legal issues related to cryptocurrency at the Chicago-based firm Smolinski Rosario Law. “People are still trying to figure out the killer use cases. So best practices are being developed on the fly.”

Compare the latest Binance examples to when Sun tweeted in October that an upcoming partnership would expose TRX to “billions of customers.” The reality was made clear later that week: A small technical update meant Samsung devices could be used more easily by Tron developers (and, ostensibly, dapp users).

Yet the price of TRX increased in the days leading up to Samsung’s flagship conference, from roughly $0.01 on Oct. 25 to $0.02 on Oct. 29, when it was clear Sun would speak at the event but there wasn’t any clarity what he would be announcing. The price slid back down after the less-than-overwhelming conference announcement on Oct. 31.

“We have a real definition problem in terms of the language we all use. We think we are saying the same things, but we’re definitely not,” Rosario said, speaking to the ambiguity of what it means to “distribute” apps and tokens.

In neither case, Zhao’s denial nor Sun’s hyped-up speech, did token fans demand apologies or retractions for unclear or misleading statements that might protect or bolster the respective token’s reputation. Those demands are reserved for statements that could be seen as negative. (CoinDesk reached out to both the Tron and Binance teams. We will update the article if we hear back.)

Heliocentrism

Stepping back, Sun may have gotten involved with the latest anti-FUD meme war because it could impact his businesses as well.

One Chinese bitcoiner and crypto investor, who asked to stay anonymous to protect business relationships with the parties involved, said Zhao and Sun work closely together and such relationships “impact how liquidity will flow.”

Plus, Sun tweeted in October that he owns a “huge bag” of BNB tokens, along with the native tokens of other Chinese exchanges that “support” the TRX project. In some ways, the price of TRX may be influenced by Binance’s liquidity, which over-the-counter traders often described as unusually authentic and reliable.

Instead, Rosario agreed with Koeppen that the crypto market’s relative immaturity can make it difficult to distinguish puffery and personal politics from any deliberate intent to manipulate retail investors.","Eight former core developers from financial services company Morgan Stanley have launched Phemex, a new cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform, in Singapore.

In a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Dec. 4, the former Morgan Stanley developers claim the platform is ten times faster than traditional crypto trading platforms, while offering 100x leverage to both retail and institutional investors in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) perpetual contracts.

Exchange is “on par with Nasdaq”

In the near future, these contracts will reportedly also be backed by traditional financial products, such as stock indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, and metals and energy. Phemex co-founder Jack Tao said:

“We are the first exchange to truly bring Wall Street level sophistication to the worldwide crypto derivatives markets. Our matching engine, trading engine, and risk engine were six months in the making, putting the platform technically on par with Nasdaq.”

Tao, who spent 11 years as an executive at Morgan Stanley, told Cointelegraph that the platform was looking to add options trading soon. In launching Phemex, Tao assembled a team of more than 30 senior developers. He explained:

“We’re not just providing the functionality for trading. As executives from Morgan Stanley, we know what kind of ways, what kind of direction, or what kind of architecture can support high-frequency trading, stability, and low latency. This is where Phemex excels — our expertise allows us to compete with and outperform existing platforms.”

Tao told Cointelegraph that since the Nov. 25 launch, Phemex has seen volume of around 1000 BTC per day on BTC/USD contracts.

Singapore regulators take a closer look at crypto derivatives

In November, Singapore's central bank and financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), proposed to bring crypto derivatives trading under its purview. The MAS’ proposal would make the trading of derivatives based on underlying assets like Bitcoin and Ether subject to the city-state’s Securities and Futures Act. For Phemex, a Singapore-domiciled company, the proposal by the MAS comes at a perfect time as it may soon allow cryptocurrency-based derivatives to be traded on regulated platforms.","""Just wait until institutional investors jump in"" has long been a rallying call for the cryptocurrency faithful.

It appears they'll need to keep waiting a little longer, with nearly 70 cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds that mostly cater to pension funds, family offices and wealthy individuals closing this year, according to San Francisco-based Crypto Fund Research. The number of new funds launched is less than half the number started in 2018, the researcher said.

The retrenchment comes amid another volatile year for cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin and its peers once again posting the kind of swings that make institutional investors uncomfortable. While high-profile advocates such as Fidelity Investments and the New York Stock Exchange's parent company plow ahead with initiatives seeking to make it easier to own digital assets, the potential customer base seems to be disappearing at a quick clip.

""The market is definitely retail driven and will remain so for the foreseeable future,"" said Nic Carter, co-founder of Boston-based cryptocurrency market tracker Coin Metrics.

At the same time, one of the other projected lures for professional money managers — regulated futures — continue to be greeted with a muted response.

Trading volumes on bitcoin futures on exchanges like Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Bakkt, which began offering futures that settled in bitcoin in September, have increased, but are still relatively low. CME's daily volume this year averaged about 32,500 bitcoins, or $236.8 million at current prices, with more than 3,500 individual accounts trading, the company said in November.

That's just a drop in the bucket compared with the volume on less-regulated trading platforms outside the U.S. Aggregate Bitcoin futures volume — mostly on exchanges letting any retail speculator buy contracts with as much as 125 times more money than they put down — exceeds $10 billion a day, according to tracker Skew.com.

That hasn't stopped Fidelity from joining long-time cryptocurrency advocates such as Michael Novogratz and the Winklevoss brothers from building out services such as custodial storage to make institutional investors more comfortable owning digital assets. Fidelity said recently that growth is exceeding internal expectations without providing specifics.

""It's not a stampede by any stretch, but people are all doing their work,"" Mr. Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners LLC, said in a recent interview. ""The next wave will come from the wealth advisers, maybe with endowments and small foundations participating."" In November, Galaxy launched two new bitcoin funds for institutional investors.

Two public funds in Virginia's Fairfax County recently increased their exposure to the industry. Earlier this year, Harvard University's endowment backed Blockstack Inc., a cryptocurrency company. Institutional investments into cryptocurrencies are likely to increase over the next five years, according to a Fidelity survey earlier this year.

Regulatory scrutiny is to blame in large part for the hesitant steps, as governments try to stop rampant scams and companies like Facebook Inc. from usurping too much power. The resulting uncertainty, as well as cryptocurrencies' inherent volatility (bitcoin has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year, but is down by more than 40% since its peak in June) are likely to continue to give many investors pause.

""Taking a step back, I think some would argue that the levels of institutional adoption are disappointing or underwhelming but, of course, this view depends entirely on expectations,"" said Spencer Bogart, general partner at San Francisco-based Blockchain Capital LLC. ""To me, the fact that there is any institutional adoption for bitcoin only 10 years into existence is a radical success and beyond what anyone could have imagined just 3 or 4 years ago.""","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of former software developers from Morgan Stanley announced on Wednesday the launch of a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange called Phemex that aims to execute trades in less than a millisecond for both retail and institutional investors.

Jack Tao, an 11-year executive with Morgan Stanley where he was the global development leader of the investment bank’s Electronic Trading (MSET) Benchmark Execution Strategies (BXS), co-founded the company. He resigned from Morgan Staley in July.

Tao has assembled a team of more than 30 senior developers, including eight former executives from Morgan Stanley’s BES and enterprise application infrastructure teams.

“The internet has made it possible to communicate and transfer information,” Tao told Reuters in a phone interview. So a public blockchain enables instant transfer of value.”

The platform has been in the beta testing phase for several weeks and commenced trading on Nov. 25, Tao said.

The exchange can manage 300,000 transactions per second, and can deliver an order entry and response time of less than 1 millisecond, Tao said.

Phemex offers up to 100 times leverage to both retail and institutional investors in bitcoin, ethereum and XRP contracts, Tao said.

Contracts will soon be able to be backed by not only crypto assets, but also by traditional financial products, such as stock indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, metals and energy, for users to trade easily and with trust, he added.

The Phemex top official also noted that existing crypto derivative trading platforms have been hampered by performance and reliability issues, especially during high-volume trading periods such as bitcoin’s mid-June $10,000 price surge.

The former Morgan Stanley developers have also built their own cold wallet system, which assigns an independent deposit address to each user, so that all assets are kept in cold wallets, or offline, Phemex said in a statement.

The cryptocurrency market is booming, and with it, criminals are looking to cash in.

Bitcoin (BTC) may not have sustained the $19,000+ price tag of previous years, now coming in at roughly $7,200 at the time of writing, but there is also a variety of other stable coins and altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Monero (XMR), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC), that maintain a loyal following and constant trade.

The industry has gained enough traction in recent years that regulators are beginning to shift towards the viewpoint that virtual coins should be considered taxable assets, with the IRS now hunting down cryptocurrency traders that do not declare their investments. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also clarified its stance (.PDF) this year on what coins can be considered securities or e-money -- some of which now land under the FCA's remit.

Russia, too, known for its hostile approach to cryptocurrency, has begun to accept that cryptocurrency may have a legal position in the economy.

With any form of asset that has financial worth, criminals will look for ways to fraudulently profit and cryptocurrency is no exception. The industry is rather unregulated, with laws potentially applied locally, but with exchanges registered worldwide, investment in cryptocurrency can be a risk.

Exchanges are a common target. A weakness in a website, a vulnerability leading to exposure of a hot wallet -- storage systems used to hold virtual coins that are Internet-connected -- insider threats, and exit scams can all result in traders losing their cryptocurrency. Wallets, too, can be ransacked when vulnerabilities are found, and the blockchain itself, the backbone technology of cryptocurrency exchanges, may be subject to attacks such as the 51% technique. Unless cryptocurrency is stashed in a cold, hardware-based wallet that is not connected to the web, there may be a risk of cyberattack.

Below, we take a look at some of the most noteworthy cases of hacking, criminal investigations, exit scams, and cryptocurrency-related breaches over 2019.

Defendants have repeatedly been undone because they’ve relied on the cryptocurrency for some part of their nefarious activities. Sometimes, they’ve been arrested years after their alleged crimes.

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, it’s estimated that 2% to 5% of the global GDP—or $800 billion to $2 trillion—is laundered each year, much of it in cash. But over the last few years, with cryptocurrencies growing in prominence and price, they’ve become a popular option, too. Government agencies have started contracting crypto-analytics firms like Chainalysis and CipherTrace to track down money launderers and other criminals.

“Cryptocurrencies have the reputation for being cross-border and anonymous, and therefore attractive to bad actors across the world,” Kim Grauer, senior economist for Chainalysis, explained to Quartz over email. “But because transactions involving cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are recorded on a permanent, public, and immutable ledger, cryptocurrencies can actually offer unprecedented transparency into financial transactions.”

Laundering money through bitcoin is like pulling off a jewelry heist, but leaving a map to your apartment at the scene of the crime. You can shred the map into tiny pieces—by sending bitcoin through multiple wallet addresses, or accounts, to hide your tracks—but with sufficient time and data-crunching power, it’s possible for other people to reassemble the clues.

What cryptocurrencies save in time (versus say, buying and selling bars of gold) they lose in efficacy. When it comes to financial crime, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ether, are blunt instruments.

“The goal of money laundering is to create a chain of transactions that can’t be traced, so since the bitcoin blockchain is designed to have an indelible public record of all transactions, it makes ‘laundering’ much more difficult,” Dave Weisberger, CEO of CoinRoutes, a crypto order-routing service, said. “The technology from [blockchain analytics] firms such as Elliptic and Chainanalysis is sophisticated as well. They can trace [wallet] addresses quite well, which also make law enforcement easier.”

That’s part of why the arrest of a crypto expert last week is confounding. Virgil Griffith, a special projects researcher for the Ethereum Foundation, was detained last week in Los Angeles. The US accuses him of traveling to North Korea earlier this year “in order [to] deliver a presentation and technical advice on using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions.”

Regardless of whether Griffith is innocent or guilty, what he’s accused of is, well, dumb. Is it possible to launder money and evade US sanctions using cryptocurrencies? Yes. Is it advisable, or even practical? Hell no. Crypto’s limited trading volumes, traceability, and storage risk affect everybody.

Reuters additionally reported that Griffith may have planned to send mining equipment to North Korea, ostensibly so the government or others could generate their own ether. Apparently he called the idea “cool.” But again—regardless of whether a crime was committed—it’s laughably unrealistic at scale, and anybody who got within 100 miles of North Korean bitcoin would put themselves on the blockchain (and watchlists) forever.

Jack Tao, who served as a senior leader at Morgan Stanley’s electronic trading desk, said he launched Phemex last month with a team of more than 30 developers, including eight executives from the investment banking giant.

Tao left his job at Morgan Stanley in New York and co-founded the crypto trading firm in Singapore in July, envisioning a platform that would be as fast and secure as stock and futures exchanges.

The budding firm has made some big promises.

“Phemex is ten times faster than traditional crypto trading platforms with the ability to manage 300,000 TPS – the fastest matching engine online,” said Tao, who specialized in high-frequency trading. No existing platform has achieved such transaction speeds, he said.

Phemex’s architecture can reduce latency so as to deliver an order entry and response time of less than one millisecond while maintaining stable APIs for algorithmic trading, according to Tao.

While crypto trading is fiercely competitive, Tao believes Phemex has a comparative advantage as a small platform.

“Big trading platforms such as CME [Chicago Mercantile Group] are very great platforms for traditional securities trading, but that’s also why they are relatively slow to adopt emerging technologies and trade digital assets,” Tao said.

Such platforms are more cautious about entering into new markets whereas startups tend to be more experimental with new frontiers, he said.

Phemex offers retail and institutional investors perpetual contracts for bitcoin, ethereum and XRP with up to 100 times leverage. These are similar to futures contracts, except they have no expiration date.

As the exchange gains traction, it plans to also offer contracts backed by traditional financial products, including stock indexes, interest rates and commodities, Tao said.

The ex-Morgan Stanley developers have created their own hierarchical deterministic cold wallet system. It assigns an independent deposit address to each user to keep assets in the cold wallets directly.","Canadian government-backed bitcoin mining firm Great North Data has filed for bankruptcy, owing millions to its creditors.

Backed by federal and provincial government agencies, the firm has liabilities of CA$13.2 million (~$10 million) against assets of CA$4.6 million (~3.49 million), CBC News reported Wednesday, citing bankruptcy documents filed late last month.

The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), responsible for helping create opportunities for economic growth in the Atlantic Provinces, is owed CA$281,675. The ACOA reportedly provided CA$500,000 to Great North Data in late 2015. The agency is now ""in contact with the client and closely following all developments"" regarding the bankruptcy.

The Newfoundland and Labrador government's Business Investment Corporation, on the other hand, is a secured creditor and is owed $313,718. That debt is secured by Great North Data's building, land, machinery and equipment, per the report.

Other unsecured creditors include Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro (CA$316,477) and the Business Development Bank of Canada (CA$225,000).



Offline

Great North Data's website is currently offline, but an archived version shows that the firm was founded in 2013, and grew ""from a basement startup to a major provider of processing capacity in Atlantic Canada.""

An archived version of the website also shows a statement, dated June 26, 2018, saying that Canadian MP Yvonne Jean Jones visited one of Great North Data's centers and said the firm ""invested over $9 million over the course of 5 years. $5-6 million of this total has been invested in contractors and equipment almost entirely hired and purchased from local sources in Labrador,"" adding:

""They currently employ 25 full-time and 4 part-time staff, and have intentions to grow this number with an additional 15-20 full time employees by December 2018. The company anticipates sales exceeding $6 million by the end of this year, which should only double throughout 2019.""

While it is not clear why the firm went bankrupt, recent reports show that Great North Data faced complaints about its operations, such as electricity use, local job creation and why its operations make a loud noise.

In response, Great North Data CEO James Goodwin, said at the time: “We are where we are, because that’s where the power is. The only other option is to shut down business.""



Meanwhile in the U.S., interest in cryptocurrency mining is on the rise, with a slew of companies announcing plans to open mining farms in Texas. These include Bitmain, Digital Currency Group (DCG)-backed Layer1, Northern Bitcoin AG and Whinstone US.","The Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division identified $1.8 billion in tax fraud in 2019, with a 91.2 percent conviction rate for all financial crimes, according to the division’s 100th annual report released Thursday, which also highlighted a continued focus on employment tax, cryptocurrency and cybercrime.

This year’s report, which marked the agency's 100th anniversary, continued a general downward trend of investigations and prosecutions for CI over the last few years. In a conference call with reporters, CI chief Don Fort attributed the trend to fewer special agents, as many retire and those who remain in service devote time to inheriting those cases and training new agents. Fort estimated that 130 to 150 agents retire every year, and that the time between onboarding new agents and completion of their first case averages two to three years.

The overall number of CI investigations initiated in 2019 was 2,485, down from 2,886 in 2018 and 3,019 in 2017. Meanwhile, $4.4 billion in proceeds from other (non-tax fraud) financial crimes were identified in 2019, 1,726 warrants were executed, and 1.24 petabytes of digital data were seized.

“We are in a hiring posture now,” Fort explained. “I’m very hopeful we’ve reached the bottom in terms of staffing. We end the year with 2,000 special agents, which puts us at 1970s levels.” Fort expects to onboard more in-depth special agents over the next year. “I’m really excited about that, and hopeful it’s not a one-time event. We have the support for a number of years of robust hiring, to get the numbers back up.""

Overall, Fort characterized the past year, his third as chief, as “exciting times” as CI ramps up hiring, continues to take advantage of technology like data analytics, and collaborates with other agencies to combat newer threats related to cryptocurrency and cybercrime.

“We’ve had tremendous cases represented by every field office in every state; a lot of positive momentum there,” Fort said. “As we’ve been challenged in the manpower perspective for the last five to six years, we have used that time wisely. We’ve made investments in cyber, cyber investigations in tax and non-tax, working in data analytics with the Nationally Coordinated Investigations Unit [which became an official CI section this year]. The success we’ve seen there, we’ve invested wisely in the last few years. With the investment in those areas, we’re seeing the fruits of our labor.”

Another area of momentum for CI has been in employment tax enforcement, one of the few areas where the unit saw an upswing in investigations initiated (250), prosecution recommendations (104), informations/indictments (73), those sentenced (50) and the incarceration rate (84 percent), all an increase over 2018.

“In particular, employment tax, we made that a point of emphasis for CI and the IRS as a whole,” Fort said. “The time spent on employment tax has gone up considerably. There is a tremendous amount of noncompliance in that area. It’s a huge part of what funds the federal government. We’ve absolutely made that a point of emphasis. It’s the goal of field officers to work a balanced program area. All noncompliance tax threats in a particular area, as well as money laundering and bank secrecy threats. I can confirm employment tax will continue to be an area of emphasis for us.”

Abusive return preparer program enforcement also experienced some positive shifts in 2019. While the number of investigations in the category were down this year, at 163, the number of prosecution recommendations (203) and sentencings (154) were up slightly over last year, keeping the incarceration rate at a flat 78 percent.



In terms of collaboration with outside agencies, Fort identified the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement, or J5, formed in 2018 among CI and its counterparts in four other countries to battle international tax evasion, as one recent success.

Other examples of interagency successes, though acknowledged by Fort to be more dated, were the shutdowns of darknet markets Silk Road and AlphaBay, in 2013 and 2017, respectively, “a great example of multi-agencies, under the Department of Justice, helping to solve crimes.”

“The most recent success in cryptocurrency was the Welcome to Video case, the child exploitation case,” Fort said, referring to what the DOJ called the “largest dark web child porn marketplace” when it took down the website in October. The use of bitcoin on the site led to CI’s involvement in tracking the cryptocurrency.

Fort anticipates that this kind of collaboration will continue in the years ahead.

“The next wave of crime, in front of our eyes, requires us to employ new ways of investigation in solving these crimes. The crimes are money- and greed-based, conducive to our work in following the money. We all have our own skills and capabilities. We have a lot of initiatives underway to partner with federal agencies and collaborate internationally.”

CI has also been partnering with academia to deepen its expertise in data analytics, working with universities and colleges that are utilizing the technology in innovative ways.

In the next year, Fort expects CI to help take down more dark web marketplaces and create more of a tax focus on cryptocurrency. Fort emphasized that CI currently has many open cases related to cryptocurrency and cybercrime that the agency hopes to make public by the end of this fiscal year.","MIAMI, Dec. 05, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via CryptoCurrencyWire -- Leading voices in finance, economy, blockchain, crypto and enterprise will join forces at The North American Bitcoin Conference at the James L.

Editor@CryptoCurrencyWire.com","Crypto lending services BlockFi on Thursday announced the launch of a digital asset trading platform, targeted to both retail and institutional investors.

Dubbed BlockFi Trading, the platform will initially allow trading in three digital assets – Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Gemini dollar.

With its new product, BlockFi is entering a highly competitive market of digital asset exchanges where players like Binance and Coinbase are dominating. To cut into the saturated market, the platform will not charge any fees to execute trades.

Commenting on the new platform, Zac Prince, founder and chief executive of BlockFi, said: “To date, we have focused on providing products to existing crypto investors that are readily available to investors in other asset classes. With the launch of trading, we are taking a big step in the direction of enabling net new investors to come into the ecosystem.”

“Growth of the crypto market overall benefits the entire industry and we’re excited to shift our focus in that direction, in addition to adding products and features that expand the value proposition for our existing clients.”

The lucrative business of crypto lending

Founded in 2017, BlockFi offers crypto lending services, offering loans to those who are interested in borrowing crypto, starting from $2,000, and going as high as $100 million, against Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin at a 4.5 percent interest rate.

It is backed by billionaire Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Capital, and raised nearly $79 million in various funding rounds, according to CrunchBase. The Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange is providing custody of BlockFi accounts, which recently added digital asset insurance coverage.

The announcement also outlined that the company completed MSB registration with FinCen and has expanded their state licensing strategy to include money transmission licenses in addition to its existing state lending licenses. These were done prior to the launch of its trading services.

Meanwhile, in its core crypto lending business, BlockFi is facing competition from players like Blockchain.com, which launched a crypto lending service last month.","Crypto mining pools offer terrorists and criminals a golden opportunity to launder cash, according to a new report.

The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), an independent think tank for international defence and security issues, says cloud-mining companies that take cash for crypto may be helping crooks hide their illicit gains.

In the report, titled ‘From Intention to Action: Next Steps in Preventing Criminal Abuse of Cryptocurrency’, authors Anton Moiseienko and Kayla Izenman write: “Cloud-mining companies that accept fiat currency and distribute cryptocurrency in effect enable their users to exchange fiat for crypto, which can lead to the conversion of criminally obtained fiat currency.

“Furthermore, a Chainalysis webinar suggests that some mining pools allow users to make and then receive fiat payments, which provides money laundering opportunities.

“In those cases, a question may arise as to whether such a company is a financial institution for AML/CTF (anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing) purposes regardless of whether it falls within the definition of a VASP (virtual asset service provider).”

If you've spoken to me at all in the last 7 months you'll know this paper was my baby… and it's finally published! Please check it out and let me know your thoughts 🤩 https://t.co/PMNDJsWI2m — Kayla Izenman (@KaylaIzenman) April 15, 2019

Furthermore, it states cloud-mining companies are not subject to AML/CTF regulation because their distribution of virtual currency is “integral to the provision of [mining] services”.

It recommends that financial watchdogs should consider keeping their approach to AML/CTF regulation of cloud-mining companies under review at all times.

Recently, Kathryn Huan, a former prosecutor on the Silk Road case, revealed the shocking statistic that 99% of all money laundering crimes go unprosecuted.

“Our current system is doing a pretty terrible job of it – 99.9% of all money laundering crimes go unprosecuted,” she said.","View

A sharp reversal from resistance at $7,800 on Wednesday has neutralized bitcoin's short-term bullish setup.

The cryptocurrency has created an inverted hammer on the daily chart, a warning of an impending sell-off. A break below the candle's low of $7,087 will likely invite stronger selling pressure and yield a drop to $6,500.

A UTC close above $7,870 (Nov. 29 high) is needed to revive the bullish view.

Bitcoin experienced a strong rejection at key resistance Wednesday, weakening the short-term bullish outlook.

The top cryptocurrency by market value quickly jumped from $7,200 to $7,800 during the U.S. trading hours on Wednesday, ending a low-volume pullback, as expected. The ascent, however, was short-lived, and prices fell back just as speedily – closing the day (UTC) with a 1.4 percent loss at $7,198, according to Bitstamp data.

The sharp move lower from $7,800 – a level that proved a tough nut to crack at the end of November – has increased the likelihood of bearish price action with the formation of a candlestick pattern called an “inverted hammer.”

While the pattern is considered a bearish signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow-through, preferably a convincing move below the low of the candle.

Put

simply, a break below Wednesday’s low of $7,087, if confirmed, will likely

attract strong selling pressure, possibly leading to a deeper drop.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,330, representing a 1.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.

Daily chart

The long upper shadow attached to the inverted hammer candle represents “sell on the rise” mentality.

So far, there’s been no bearish follow-through. However, that does not mean the path of least resistance is to the higher side, as the cryptocurrency is also held below the resistance of a descending trendline sloping downwards through the Oct. 26 and Nov. 15 highs.

A bullish reversal would only be confirmed if and when the cryptocurrency finds acceptance above $7,870 (Nov. 29 high), invalidating the lower-highs setup.

If prices find acceptance under $7,087 (inverted hammer’s low), that would imply a continuation of the sell-off from $7,870 and will likely yield a re-test of recent lows near $6,511.

3-day chart

Bitcoin charted a bullish hammer reversal pattern in the six days to Nov. 29. So far, however, the follow-through has been anything but bullish, and has faced strong rejection at $7,800, as noted above.

As a result, the immediate outlook is neutral."
2019-12-06,"Bitcoin was born out of despair. Hidden among the lines of code in the first ever batch of the cryptocurrency was a headline from the frontpage of that day’s edition of The Times: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”.

It was 3 January, 2009, and the world was in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Banks were collapsing, businesses were foreclosing and people were losing their homes.

It was the result of the worst excesses and greed of a capitalistic system that was teetering on the edge of comprehensive collapsed. But Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, believed he had a solution.

It came in the form of a revolutionary “electronic cash system” that ditched centralised systems like banks and governments in favour of a peer-to-peer payments network supported by an online ledger known as a blockchain.

But for all its promise, it turned out to be a bumpy revolution. Nothing much actually happened for the first few years after bitcoin‘s birth, and it lay largely dormant until after the worst of the period’s economic turmoil had already passed.

In the early 2010s it was only a core group of cypherpunks and cryptography enthusiasts that really understood bitcoin’s potential but its semi-anonymous nature meant it soon found use among drug dealers and cyber criminals on the dark web.

After a brief price surge in 2012 it began to gain more widespread recognition and by late 2017 it was making frontpage headlines of its own as its market capitalisation briefly exceed $300 billion – more than the entire GDP of over 140 countries.

Some warned at the time that the phenomenal price growth was the result of a bubble – and, sure enough, it eventually crashed. Throughout 2018 its value tumbled repeatedly – and sometimes spectacularly – as naysayers pronounced its death and late investors lost millions.

By the start of 2019, a bitcoin was worth less than $4,000 and excitement for the great economic experiment had subsided before any truly mass-market use cases had even been realised.

But it was far from over. As the decade draws to a close, news about new digital currency projects have begun to emerge – from vast multi-national corporations like Facebook, to some of the world’s biggest economies.

With each positive news story about cryptocurrency, the price of bitcoin has grown, yet the volatility remains. For some, this unpredictability is one of the reasons it can never achieve its potential as a mainstream form of currency.

Bitcoin’s first major price burst in 2013 was a small blip compared to subsequent price spikes of the 2010s (CoinMarketCap)

Sceptics remain and misconceptions of bitcoin being some kind of “magic internet money” with no inherent worth continue to dominate stale narratives about cryptocurrency.

Some cryptocurrency advocates point to the fact that, on the contrary, it is traditional currencies that can be created out of thin air through processes like quantitative easing. And while established currencies are no longer backed by gold or anything tangible, bitcoin has the blockchain to mathematically regulate a finite supply.

Nigel Green, CEO of London-based financial advisory firm deVere Group, claims cryptocurrencies are redefining and reshaping the financial system and that critics are either ignoring, or simply not understanding, the promise they hold.

“I would suggest that most people saying these things do not understand the crypto sector as it is relatively young and/or have vested interests in older, traditional ones,” he tells The Independent. “However, whether they like it or not, dyed-in-the-wool financial traditionalists need to accept that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.”

✕ What is cryptocurrency and the technology behind bitcoin and its rivals?

Bitcoin may have assured its place in history but its future remains uncertain. There have already been thousands of spin-offs – there are currently 2,364 different cryptocurrencies listed on monitoring site CoinMarketCap – and some believe one of these will soon take its place as the dominant cryptocurrency.

Some of the more notable ones, like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash, offer something slightly different to bitcoin, such as quicker transaction times or greater anonymity.

Yet it is the pseudo cryptocurrencies being developed by countries and companies that could see the most mainstream success over the coming decade. They will not be decentralised and will likely be tools to track users rather than provide privacy, but they will solve two of the biggest problems: trust and stability.

“Cryptocurrencies have arguably been the radical fintech innovation of the decade. But while the 2010s has been an exploratory phase – introducing the concepts of cryptocurrencies and blockchain to the world – the 2020s will be the decade for innovation and application,” Christel Quek, co-founder of cryptocurrency company Bolt, tells The Independent.

Beyond new currencies inspired by bitcoin, a whole new industry is forming from its underlying blockchain technology. At its core, it provides an immutable and unhackable platform for storing and transacting digital assets and records, meaning it could potentially transform everything from healthcare to the food industry.

Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology is set to transform dozens of industries (Gartner)

Felix Shipkevich, a New York-based lawyer with expertise in blockchain regulations, says the technology ""has the power to change the world for the better"" by providing a new standard for accountability and trust.

Bitcoin has not only brought blockchain into existence, it has challenged regulatory obstacles that stand in the way of this new wave of applications being realised.

“Cryptocurrencies have given rise to regulators’ acceptance of digital cash and fintech products and services that are both novel and progressive,"" Shipkevich tells The Independent. ""We’ve seen greater acceptance by regulators versus total rejection.

""We saw this happen in China, where crypto trading was strictly prohibited, but are now announcing the use of blockchain technology as a major government and fiscal technology initiative.”

Thousands of cryptocurrencies have emerged in the 2010s, and more will certainly follow in the 2020s (Getty)

The 2010s may have been defined by bitcoin but the next 10 years will dictate which cryptocurrency truly takes off and emerges to rival traditional currencies.

It would be foolish to write-off bitcoin - its death has been pronounced more than 350 times in the press, according to a website tracking ""bitcoin obituaries"" - but its flaws could see it become simply a store of value rather than a mainstream form of exchange.

Much like MySpace and Bebo were usurped by Facebook in the early days of social media, another cryptocurrency could come along to take bitcoin's crown as the most popular cryptocurrency - maybe even Facebook's Libra.

If this happens, predictions about bitcoin's price reaching $500,000 or even $1 million over the next few years will appear wildly ambitious. Then again, it has proved its doubters wrong more than once before.

Cyber security pioneer and bitcoin believer John McAfee made a bold bet about the cryptocurrency’s future (Twitter)

At the start of the decade, bitcoin was worth just $0.03. It will likely close out the 2010’s somewhere north of $7,000.

Another Great Recession could cause enough of a seismic shift in the established order for bitcoin's price to rocket once again and for Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision to finally be realised.

Or it could continue its steady yet chaotic climb to achieve mainstream success through favourable regulation and greater commercial acceptance, which has been quietly underway over the last decade.

It may have been born out of despair but it enters the new decade full of hope.","Charles Schwab has released its Q3 investment indicator report, a quarterly report that breaks down investment allocation across the firm’s brokerage accounts. It corroborates what most of us have known for a while now: Millennials are more attuned to the value of bitcoin than their Gen-X and Boomer counterparts.

According to the report, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was the fifth most popular equity across Millennial accounts managed by the brokerage firm, representing 1.84 percent of all assets held under management for the age group. Millennials represent 12.9 percent of Charles Schwab’s clients, compared to 41.8 percent for Gen-Xers and 38.6 percent for Boomers.

Topping the list for Millennials was Amazon (7.87 percent), followed by Apple (6.18 percent), Tesla (3.22 percent) and Facebook (3.03 percent). In a twist of irony, Berkshire Hathaway — a holding company founded and helmed by famed bitcoin bear Warren Buffett — lagged just behind GBTC at 1.73 percent.

By contrast, Berkshire Hathaway featured more prominently for both Gen-X and Boomer investors, taking up the third spot in both categories for 2.37 and 2.75 percent, respectively. Whereas Amazon topped Apple for the Millennial age group, these two stocks traded places for Gen-Xers and Boomers, with Apple usurping the top spot from Amazon.

The Millennial Embrace of Bitcoin

Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust did not break into the top ten of Schwab’s Gen-X and Boomer portfolios, nor did Tesla or the Walt Disney Co. Even so, to see GBTC featured among blue chip stocks in the Millennial category could be considered a legitimizing milestone for an asset that Warren Buffett has lambasted as “rat poison squared.”

And it also speaks to the notion that Millennials, accustomed to growing up in an ever-evolving digital environment, will warm up to bitcoin before their older generational counterparts. Per a U.S. survey conducted on behalf of Blockchain Capital, 27 percent of surveyees under the age of 35 reported that they’d rather own bitcoin than stocks. within this same age group, 37 percent indicated that they owned stock, while 20 percent said they owned bitcoin — a data point that Blockchain Capital general partner Spencer Bogart called “particularly surprising” when compared to the fact that only 37 percent of people under age 35 are invested in the stock market.

https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/1123201069494853632

The Millennial generation’s relative apathy toward the stock market — and, obversely, its attraction toward bitcoin — speaks to the gulf of wealth ownership between generations in the U.S. According to a 2019 Federal Reserve Report by Business Insider, Boomers owned roughly 21 percent of all American wealth when, in 1989, they reached roughly the age Millennials are today. By comparison, Millennials own a piddling 3 percent today. Meanwhile, the Boomers now control 60 percent of wealth share in the U.S., while Gen-Xers own some 16 percent.

Millennials have gravitated toward bitcoin and other assets that haven’t been concentrated in the preceding generations (such as Tesla and Facebook) perhaps in an attempt to correct this wealth gap.

At the least, GBTC, which sells bitcoin at a hefty premium, has been active since 2015 and has proved itself a stand-in for other regulated institutional on-ramps, such as a bitcoin ETF.

The Schwab survey demonstrates that the demand for bitcoin among younger generations is there; if there were other, more buttoned-up methods of buying and holding it for your average investor, perhaps we’d see even more — especially among a generation that holds less than a sliver of the wealth that their parents held at the same age.

Bitcoin’s monthly MACD histogram, a lagging indicator, has turned bearish for the first time since May.

A break below the recent low of $6,511 is needed to validate the MACD’s bearish turn. That level may come into play if prices find acceptance under the Dec. 4 low of $7,087.

A UTC close above $7,087 (Nov. 29 high) would revive the short-term bullish outlook.

A widely followed long-term bitcoin chart indicator has turned bearish for the first time since May.

The monthly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and gauge trend strength, has crossed below zero to indicate a bullish-to-bearish trend change in prices.

Some observers have called the MACD’s bearish turn bad news for bitcoin. The indicator, however, is based on 12- and 26-month exponential moving averages (EMAs) and tends to lag prices.

Therefore, the latest bear cross has limited predictive powers and is more a confirmation or result of the prevailing bearish trend as represented by the sell-off from the June high of $13,880 to the November low of $6,500.

A popular Twitter analyst going by the name of “Mr. Anderson” (@TrueCrypto28) told CoinDesk that, as the the monthly MACD is a lagging indicator, traders should focus on smaller time frames.

“Even if we are about to interpret it as bearish, that is coming after a mover from $14K to $7k and is woefully late,” Mr. Anderson said. “If someone likes the MACD, the weekly is plenty proficient. And the daily would do you just fine as well.”

Some analysts may argue that monthly MACD crossovers have proved reliable in the past. For instance, BTC dropped sharply in 2014 and 2018 following bearish crossovers of the histogram.

Monthly chart

The MACD’s move below zero in July 2018 was followed by three months of sideways trading and a sharp slide to levels below $4,000 in November.

On similar lines, in 2014, bitcoin fell from $490 to $150 in the five months following the confirmation of the bear cross in August.

Even so, the latest crossover should not demoralize the bulls, as the broader market conditions are different today than those in the above instances.

Back in 2014 and 2018, bitcoin was coming off record highs and, with the histogram’s bearish turn, traders likely found a reason to take profits or sell the cryptocurrency.

This time, the MACD’s shift is not preceded by record highs: the cryptocurrency topped out at $13,880 (well short of the lifetime high of $20,000) at the end of June.

More importantly, the 52 percent drop seen over the last five months is widely being viewed as a corrective move in a broader uptrend from lows near $4,000 seen in early April. Additionally, there are signs of seller exhaustion on the technical charts.

3-day chart

Bitcoin charted a classic long-tailed hammer candle in the three days to Nov. 26, signaling bearish exhaustion near six month lows. The cryptocurrency posted a strong bullish follow-through in the following three days, confirming a bullish reversal.

The short-term bullish case weakened with Wednesday’s strong rejection at $7,800, however. Prices are still holding above $6,511, even so, meaning signal of seller exhaustion is still valid.

The monthly MACD’s bearish reading would gain credence only if prices find acceptance below $6,511.

Daily chart

A UTC close above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870 is needed to invalidate the lower-highs setup and revive the short-term bullish case. A bullish close, if confirmed, would open the doors for $8,500.

On the downside, $7,087 is key support. A drop below that level would validate an inverted bearish hammer created on Dec. 4 and likely invite stronger selling pressure leading to a drop to recent lows near $6,500.","In order to satisfy its customers’ needs, the cryptocurrency lending service BlockFi has presented a new zero-fee trading model.

Premier cryptocurrency lending service BlockFi has introduced a new feature. It is trading at no fees for Bitcoin, Ethereum and the stablecoin GUSD. The startup has been known to allow users access to returns on their cryptocurrency holdings by offering loans to borrowers against users’ cryptocurrency holdings and then passing across the returns in terms of interest on the loans while securing the crypto assets that were used as security for the loans.

While this model is known to have been extremely successful, the startup has gone one level further by offering to trade of one cryptocurrency asset against another without any need for fees. In this scenario, a user will be able to sell one cryptocurrency asset for another for zero fees. The big question therefore that many have asked is: where will the revenue streams come from? The answer to this will be the data on trades and consumer behavior that will be sold to institutional cryptocurrency firms. These firms will also step into the new market place and will take on the role of market makers which will enhance the liquid position of the new market place. BlockFi Ceo Zac Prince referred to this when he said:

“Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,”

This, of course, has brought the issue of privacy of users data which has many people worried. The company itself has sought to allay peoples’ fears when it said that users’ data will be anonymized and that no personalized records will be made available to the cryptocurrency firms.

Sources further indicate that a number of the market makers have been clients of BlockFi on the lending side and some have also been investors in the startup in the early days. They include Akuna Capital, Susquehanna, and CMT Digital.

The CEO’s position is that multiple partnerships for BlockFi allow for the deepening of partnerships with such partners which shows his interest in building the business side of things with such partners for the long term.

The cryptocurrency startup has also indicated that the decision to go into trading was made after a customer survey demonstrated that a large portion of withdrawals was made for trading activities.

This also proves that the startup, that was supported by such prominent names as Galaxy Digital, Winklevoss Capital, ConsenSys Ventures, understands how to respond to the needs of customers.

The cryptocurrency startup has also indicated that it will be adding more cryptocurrency options shortly which include USDC and Litecoin and is also looking towards bringing in new traders in the crypto-space onto its platforms. At the end of the day, it is these kinds of customer-centric innovations that will encourage further cryptocurrency adoption.","An Indian fugitive ‘holy man’ accused of rape and other crimes has announced he has set up his own country – and will run its economy with cryptocurrency.

Nithyananda, from Tamil Nadu, attracted followers in a spiritual centre – known as an ‘ashram’ – he opened in Bengaluru during 2005, but cops claimed he raped and assaulted a woman at the ashram under the guise of giving her religious teachings.

Officers also allege the 41-year-old beat children and forced them to earn money for the ashram.

He fled India and has now declared a ‘Hindu sovereign nation’ called Kailaasa after buying his own island off the coast of Ecuador, reports the Times of India.

A website has been registered in Panama with its IP located in the US state of Dallas. However, mystery surrounds Kailaasa’s exact location.

As well as a flag, constitution, and emblem, the website says the nation will have its own economy that is “not contaminated by fiat currency”.

It adds: “Imagine that this currency is the only one accepted in the Paramashiva economy – to participate in the Dharmic economy, one that is aligned with the cosmic laws, one that will give them enormous spiritual rewards and multiple returns on investment, people have to use this currency.

“An ideal way to create such a currency is through cryptocurrency.”

In February, a ‘private city’ in Norway ditched cash for its own cryptocurrency.

Liberstad, which was established in June 2017 in the south of the Scandinavian country, is a self-proclaimed libertarian city.

A spokesman said: “City Coin is a secure and innovative cryptocurrency based on City Chain, a smart city platform that enables the design, implementation, and use of next-generation services for smart cities and their inhabitants.”","eclipse_images | E+ | Getty Images

Tax season is still months away, but the IRS will want to know about your cryptocurrency holdings. The IRS just released a new Schedule 1 for the 2019 tax season, spelling out the details on above-the-line deductions, including the tax break for student loan interest and health savings account contributions. Eagle-eyed taxpayers will notice that the IRS threw in an extra question on the form: ""At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?"" This is the agency's latest effort to gather additional information on taxpayers' virtual currency holdings. See below for the form

""The biggest thing is that the IRS is asking this for a reason, and my question is how much have you increased your audit risk by checking 'Yes' in response?"" asked Jeffrey Levine, CPA and director of financial planning at BluePrint Wealth Alliance in Garden City, New York. The inquiry itself is a vague one, experts said. ""As a taxpayer myself, I find this question very frustrating because it isn't clear,"" said Sarah-Jane Morin, partner at Morgan Lewis in San Francisco.

Moving your own virtual currency from one crypto wallet to another, for instance, could be considered ""sending,"" she said ""The most conservative approach that a taxpayer can take is to consider any interaction you've had with virtual currency and whether there's any way this can fall under this very broad list of what you could've engaged in during 2019,"" said Morin. Indeed, the IRS has signaled that it would be taking a closer look at cryptocurrency. Back in July, the agency announced it was sending letters to more than 10,000 taxpayers with virtual currency transactions who may have failed to report income and pay taxes owed. Here are the tax basics on cryptocurrency.

Varying tax treatments

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) headquarters in Washington, D.C. Janhvi Bhojwani | CNBC

If you sold your cryptocurrency, you need to report the transaction. If you wound up with a capital gain, you must pay the appropriate tax. Cryptocurrency you receive from an employer is subject to federal income tax withholding, FICA tax and federal unemployment taxes, just like wages. These should be reported on your Form W-2, the IRS said. Meanwhile, independent contractors who are paid in virtual currency must pay self-employment taxes. For those who mine cryptocurrency, the fair market value of it as of the day of receipt is included in your gross income, according to IRS guidance.

Failure to properly report these transactions can be costly: You may be audited and held liable for penalties and interest. In the most extreme cases, you could face prison time and a fine of up to $250,000. ""A taxpayer who is investing in virtual currency should have a system for tracking the purchase and selling price of the assets,"" said April Walker, lead manager for tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of CPAs. ""For tax purposes, the virtual currency is treated as property, similar to a security,"" she said. ""Therefore, taxpayers should maintain cost records similar to the way records are kept for stocks and securities, although there will be no monthly statements.""

Following basis

Luc MacGregor | Bloomberg | Getty Images","Deutsche Bank has published its outlook for the decade ahead, predicting growth in appeal of cryptocurrency given the fragility of fiat money.

The 'Imagine 2030' report highlights the dangers of the forces holding the fiat money system unravelling in the next decade, in turn fuelling the demand for crypto.



Deutsche Bank describes cryptocurrencies as ""additions rather than substitutions"", but believes this may change by 2030.



Given the aging population, labour costs, which have been low for decades, could increase, bringing an end to generations of low inflation and signalling a return to the ""rampaging late-1970s peak"".



This will drive demand for alternative currencies, while fiat money will be tested by governments and central banks wrestling with higher inflation and the policy decisions that come with it.



Deutsche sees the potential in cryptocurrencies taking off a payment method given the advantages of speed, security, minimal cost and ""relevance in the digital era"".



The German bank therefore concludes that a new, mainstream cryptocurrency may emerge in the decade ahead.

With regulatory support, their appeal and adoption could increase and eventually replace cash, given the desire of governments and banks to move to a cashless society.



Cryptocurrency needs to acquire legitimacy in the eyes of governments and regulators, which would bring stability in the price and allow for global reach. This would fuel the interest of stakeholders in the payments industry, such as Visa and Mastercard, not to mention tech giants like Apple and Google.



In the short-term, however, political support remains far from clear. Buying and selling cryptocurrency in China and India is banned, with the former adopting a singularly hard stance of late.



Moving to any kind of digitised, global payments system will also bring to the fore concerns of cybercrime or anything else that curtails the use of electricity.","Why did this happen?

For more information you can review our Terms of Service and Cookie Policy.","U.S. Congressman Brad Sherman (Democrat-California), who once called for a blanket ban on cryptocurrency buying, has been elected as chairman of the Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets.

The House Financial Services Committee announced the news Thursday, saying that Sherman has been elected by the Democratic Caucus and the development is subject to approval by the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee as well as the Democratic Caucus.

Sherman would replace Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. “I want to thank Congresswoman Maloney for her leadership as Chair of the Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets, and I look forward to working with Congressman Sherman in his new capacity as we continue to make great strides in our efforts to protect investors and the integrity of our capital markets,” said Congresswoman Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee.

Waters and Sherman both have been opponents of digital currencies in general. Waters, for instance, recently said: “My concerns remain with allowing a large tech company to create a privately controlled, alternative global currency,” referencing Facebook-led Libra stablecoin project. Sherman, on the other hand, once said: “We should prohibit U.S. persons from buying or mining cryptocurrencies.”

The Subcommittee on Investor Protection oversees the Securities and Exchange Commission and self-regulatory organizations, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. “My colleagues are already giving me good ideas for hearings and legislation. I am committed to defending investor protections, improving access to capital and maintaining the Wall Street reforms that have helped fuel our economy. As a CPA [Certified Public Accountant], I also look forward to looking at accounting issues,” said Sherman."

Africa will define the future, especially the Bitcoin one, said Twitter's Jack Dorsey

Even as India and RBI are against cryptocurrency, Twitter CEO and cofounder Jack Dorsey believes Africa could be define the future for Bitcoin. Dorsey who is also the CEO of Square, a fintech company, recently visited Africa and now plans to live there in 2020.

Dorsey tweeted,

“Sad to be leaving the continent…for now. Africa will define the future (especially the Bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I’ll be living here for 3-6 months mid 2020. Grateful I was able to experience a small part.”

Interestingly, Dorsey, earlier in July this year, hired former Google director Steve Lee to head the crypto development project at Square. He, however, has not supported Facebook’s Libra and even questioned the intent behind the development.

On Libra, Dorsey had earlier commented,

“It’s not an internet open standard that was born on the internet. ..It was born out of a company’s intention, and it’s not consistent with what I personally believe and what I want our company to stand for.”

So India is missing out an economic opportunity by barring cryptocurrency and Bitcoin? Only time will tell.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price continues to fluctuate. On December 5, Bitcoin transactions worth $8.9 Bn were processed in a single hour.

The flip-flops on December 5, however, didn’t impress Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital. He commented, “Bitcoin pump & dumpers are losing their mojo. They managed to pump the price by $550 in one minute, a 7.5% spike. Yet the dump reversed the entire pump with an 8% drop in just 7.5 hours. If #Bitcoin pumpers can no longer sucker in new buyers the game is over.”

Let’s take a look at this week’s news!

“It’s Happening World Over” RBI Defends Anti-Crypto Stance

The RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, on December 5, once again defended the RBI notice of banning banks from extending any service to crypto entities. Responding to a media question, Das reiterated that with regard to virtual currency there is the fact it is private digital currency. RBI is very clearly against any kind of private digital currency.”

“Let me also add that it’s not just the RBI, world over, the central banks and the governments are against the private digital currency. This is because currency issuance is a sovereign function. A private currency cannot override sovereign mandate…there are huge challenges around money laundering,” said Das.

Das definitely needs to revisit his statement which is factually incorrect. In US while over two dozen crypto Bills are pending or in process, Australia has successfully regulated cryptocurrencies. Japan and South Korea also have favourable laws pertaining to cryptocurrencies.

The questions that emerge are:

How informed is the RBI on the matter of cryptocurrencies?

Can cryptocurrencies be banned under the garb of law?

Numerous blockchain innovations use tokens as part of the validation process, won’t this discourage the blockchain innovation at large?

Be it ecommerce or trade policies at large, is India blindly following China on these matters?

Every time, there has been a banking fiasco be it, in terms of demonetisation, PNB Bank scam or PMC Bank scam, there has been an increased investment in cryptocurrencies in India. On the other end, cryptocurrencies are also largely transacted at dark web. Can RBI find a balance between the two extremes?

On fiat cryptocurrency, Das said, “It’s too early. As and when the technology evolves, with certain safeguards, it is an area the reserve bank will look seriously at an appropriate time. The technology is still evolving and is at an incipient stage.”

According to 3iQ Corp, the company will act as the investment manager and portfolio manager of the Fund.

Bitcoin To Hit $10K Soon: Bloomberg Research

Bloomberg has released a new research paper which claims that it’s just a matter of time before Bitcoin hits $10K as we head into 2020. The paper also draws a positive picture of Bitcoin in 2020.

The report has also stated that the rise of Tether has impacted Bitcoin positively. It said, “Love It or Hate It, Tether Boosts Bitcoin as Crypto Standard. There’s little to dislodge Bitcoin and Tether as the crypto-asset leaders, in our opinion, with related market implications. The mass adoption of the Tether stable coin has negative ramifications for most crypto assets masquerading as currencies, and positive implications for a solitary digital equivalent of gold, Bitcoin.”

IDAX’s CEO Missing With Cold Wallet

Crypto exchange IDAX’s CEO has reportedly disappeared along with the cold wallet which may have over $500 Mn worth cryptocurrencies.

In an announcement, the company stated, “IDAX Global CEO have gone missing with unknown cause and IDAX Global staffs were out of touch with IDAX Global CEO. For this reason, access to Cold wallet which is stored almost all cryptocurrency balances on IDAX has been restricted so in effect, deposit/withdrawal service cannot be provided.”","Cryptocurrencies have the potential to eventually replace cash, according to new research from financial services giant Deutsche Bank.

In the “Imagine 2030” research report, Germany-headquartered Deutsche Bank said cryptocurrencies may have been “additions” rather than “substitutes” in the finance world thus far, but the next decade could change that as regulatory hurdles get past.

“If one of the GAFA [Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon] (or their Chinese counterparts BATX [Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi]) for example are able to overcome regulatory hurdles...this would broaden the appeal of cryptocurrencies, hasten their adoption, and give them the potential to eventually replace cash,” per the report, which is led by Jim Reid, global head of fundamental credit strategy and thematic research at Deutsche Bank.

The current fiat system looks “fragile,” particularly because of “decades of low labor costs” and inflation. Over the next decade, things could change and “demand for alternative currencies, from gold to crypto, could take off,” according to the report.

Benefits of cryptocurrencies such as security, speed, minimal transaction fees, ease of storage and “relevance in the digital era” could help drive mass adoption in the years to come, it added.

Another reason that cryptocurrencies could become the “21st-century cash” is their privacy, per the report. “Nearly two thirds of consumers prefer dematerialised to cash payments and a third are concerned by anonymity. These are the two things that cryptocurrencies do best.”

Eventually, inflation could drive demand for alternative currencies. “Will fiat currencies survive the policy dilemma that authorities will experience as they try to balance higher yields with record levels of debt? That’s the multi-trillion dollar (or bitcoin) question for the decade ahead,” said Reid.

Cryptocurrencies, however, need to become legal in the eyes of governments and regulators to become widespread, per the report. This would bring price stability, allow for global reach and see increased interest from companies in the payments industry, such as Visa and Mastercard, as well as from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart.

While many predict the end of cash in the years to come, Deutsche Bank believes that plastic cards could die out as smartphones make physical cards obsolete. “Whether it is through the eager adoption by millennials or the increased digitalisation of countries’ infrastructure, the plastic card could be on its way out over the next decade while people will still be paying with humble notes and coins.” Governments and banks are also moving towards a cashless society, per the report.

Based on current trends, the Deutsche Bank research report further said that the number of blockchain wallet users would increase to 200 million by 2030.","While Markets Move Sideways, Crypto Whale Sightings Increase

While cryptocurrency markets have been moving sideways during the last few weeks, digital currency proponents have been observing large bitcoin whale movements. Transactions with tens of thousands of BTC have been noticed on the move from one wallet to another. On Friday, one colossal BTC holder moved over 50,000 BTC ($410 million) and cycled the funds through multiple addresses.

Bitcoin Whale Sightings

One of cryptocurrency’s favorite topics is the subject of whales and the large digital currency holders who can make prices swing with a single transaction. Depending on who you ask, the definition of a whale can vary. Some believe that a whale can hold 1,000 BTC or more to make it into the club. In February, the number of addresses that had 1,000 to 10,000 BTC ($7.5-75.1 million) was approximately 1,709. Since then, the number of these types of whales increased by 18.6% as there are 2,028 addresses with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC today. While BTC spot prices seem stagnant at the end of 2019, every now and then there’s been unexpected price spikes and rapid drops in value over the last two months. Crypto speculators have attributed this market action to whales buying and selling thousands of coins.

For instance, crypto enthusiasts have focused their attention on the Twitter bot Whale Alert, an account that tracks onchain settlement for coins like BTC, ETH and XRP. During the late evening on Sept. 5, U.S. EST, a whale moved 94,504 BTC or $711 million in one fell swoop. A few weeks ago, on Oct. 17, a transaction for 9,999 BTC ($75 million) caught the crowd’s attention.

Last Wednesday, during the early morning trading sessions onchain observers witnessed 43,564 BTC ($327 million) withdrawn from the exchange Bittrex. A few days later, on Friday, another whale moved 55,354 BTC ($410 million) from unknown wallet to another unknown wallet. The Twitter bot Whale Alert registered at the time more than $10 billion worth of these cycled transactions and the account noted that the transactions were “very likely change transactions” or some form of consolidation. Within roughly 30 minutes, there were 22 transactions recorded with movements of over 55,000 BTC.

342,000 Ethereum on the Move

Besides the BTC whales moving massive amounts of funds, digital currency observers have been watching the ETH whale who drained 342,000 ETH ($50 million) from Upbit’s hot wallet on Nov. 27. After the hack, the South Korean exchange Upbit promised to compensate all of the funds that were taken. The stolen ether started moving on Dec. 3, as both the Twitter bot Whale Alert and Etherscan flagged the transactions. In the last 24 hours, the hacker continues to shift the funds to different addresses in large amounts.

So far, there’s been a total of eight ETH transactions on the move that stem from the Upbit hack in November. With every transaction, the funds have been sent to unknown Ethereum addresses to sit and so far none of the funds have been sent to known exchange addresses. The eight transactions also followed a pattern on Saturday as one transaction worth 1,000 ETH would be sent, it would be followed by another transaction worth 10,000 ETH.

Onchain movements and giant whales have always fascinated the crypto community and whale sightings can be seen on numerous blockchains. The reason large holders are focused upon in this regard is that their massive movements can sway markets in the blink of an eye. Despite the massive transfers, the crowd cannot truly connect large transactions to major market movements, but it’s safe to say the crypto community will eagerly continue to watch whale activities.

Germany’s second-largest stock exchange, Boerse Stuttgart, has opened up its cryptocurrency trading platform to all interested traders in the country. This move follows the passing of a bill allowing banks in Germany to sell and hold cryptocurrencies for their clients starting next year.

Regulated Crypto Trading Platform

Boerse Stuttgart announced Friday that its digital asset trading platform is “now open to any interested persons in Germany.” The BSDEX platform was launched in September but only for selected users. The company described:

At Germany’s first regulated trading venue for digital assets, users can currently trade bitcoin against the euro. Additional digital assets are to be added.

To access the BSDEX platform, the user must be at least 18 years of age, a resident of Germany, a European Economic Area (EEA) national, and have a German bank account. The platform offers free cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals with varying trading fees based on the order type.

“The BSDEX is a multilateral trading system that brings together buyers and sellers of digital assets through an open order book,” Boerse Stuttgart explained, adding that customer orders are executed directly against each other. The company elaborated:

At the moment our offer is limited to Germany. However, our goal is to make it available in other countries in the future.

The digital asset platform complies with the regulatory requirements of the German Banking Act. The Baden-Württembergische Wertpapierbörse, which also acts as a holding company of the public stock exchange, regulates and monitors the compliance of the platform. The technical operator of the BSDEX is the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange, a joint venture between the Boerse Stuttgart Group, Axel Springer, and Finanzen. Blocknox, a subsidiary of the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures, acts as the custodian holding customers’ cryptocurrencies.

Early this year, Boerse Stuttgart launched a crypto trading app called Bison, developed by Sowa Labs, a fintech subsidiary of the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures. The smartphone app can be used to buy and sell BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP from financial services provider Euwax AG, a subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart.

Germany’s Crypto-Forward Bill

Germany has recently emerged as a crypto haven following the passing of a bill on Nov. 29 which allows banks to sell and hold cryptocurrencies for their clients starting next year. The new rules have been adopted as part of the implementation of “Directive (EU) 2018/843 of 30 May 2018,” the fifth AML Directive, explained global law firm Dentons.

Under the new rules, crypto assets qualify as financial instruments, the law firm continued, emphasizing that this was disputed in the past. According to the firm, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) took the view that utility tokens did not qualify as financial instruments, but investment tokens qualify as securities and currency tokens qualify as “units of account” — both of which fall under the definition of financial instruments pursuant to the German Banking Act.

The new rules also include licensing requirements. Companies wanting to provide crypto trading or custody services are required to obtain a license from Bafin as a bank or an investment firm, the law firm further detailed. “Entities that provide no other financial services than custody are exempted from certain rules that apply to other investment firms.” Among other requirements, companies seeking a license for only the crypto asset business must have an initial capital of 125,000 euros ($138,234). Dentons added:

The new law will enter into force on January 1, 2020, subject to certain transition periods.

Entities wanting to obtain a license for crypto-related services should notify Bafin of their intention to obtain a license on or before March 31, 2020. The law firm clarified that “In such case, the license will be deemed to be awarded on a preliminary basis, provided that they will submit a complete application for a license no later than November 30, 2020.”

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved an investment fund that will invest in bitcoin futures contracts. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce calls this move “a bit of progress.” The SEC has also revealed why it decided to approve such a fund.

Bitcoin Futures Fund Cleared to Launch

The U.S. SEC declared the registration statement filed by Stone Ridge Trust VI for the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund effective on Monday. The company filed Form N-2 with the SEC on Oct. 2 and amended it twice, on Oct. 16 and Nov. 26. This form is used by closed-end management investment companies to register and offer their shares under the Securities Act. Stone Ridge Asset Management Llc will be the fund’s investment adviser. As of Aug. 30, the company managed approximately $15 billion of assets.

The NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund “is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that continuously offers its shares,” the filing details, adding:

The fund pursues its investment objective primarily by investing in bitcoin futures contracts … The only bitcoin futures in which the fund will invest are cash-settled bitcoin futures traded on commodity exchanges registered with the CFTC.

“The fund will not invest in bitcoin or other digital assets directly,” the filing emphasizes. “The fund will seek to purchase a number of bitcoin futures so that the total value of the bitcoin underlying the bitcoin futures held by the fund is as close to 100% of the net assets of the fund.” Its shares are being offered initially at an offering price of $10 per share. Only institutional investors, their clients, and certain eligible investors as specified in the fund’s prospectus can invest in the fund. Currently, CME is the only CFTC-approved exchange offering cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts.

The fund has an interval structure; it aims to conduct quarterly share repurchase offers, which it expects to be for a maximum of 5% of the fund’s outstanding shares at net asset value per quarter. The initial quarterly repurchase offer is planned for May 2020. This fund will not be a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), however, as its filing states:

The fund’s shares are not listed and the fund does not currently intend to list its shares for trading on any national securities exchange.

‘A Bit of Progress’

At the 2019 ICI Securities Law Developments Conference on Tuesday, Dalia Blass, Director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, talked about cryptocurrency ETFs and the SEC staff’s decision to approve a fund investing in bitcoin futures contracts. “We welcome and value constructive industry engagement regarding new products and novel investment strategies,” she said. “A prime example of such engagement involves registered funds seeking to invest substantially in digital assets and related investments.”

Blass explained that she issued a public letter last year calling on the fund industry to discuss issues presented by such investments, elaborating:

As a result of this engagement, we are at the point that a registered closed-end interval fund with a bitcoin futures strategy is preparing to launch. To reach this point, the fund first responded to each of the issues identified in the staff letter.

Commenting on Blass’ speech, Commissioner Hester Peirce, aka Crypto Mom, tweeted on Wednesday that the agency’s move is “A bit of progress.”

Without naming the fund, Blass explained that it expects “to generally value its bitcoin futures holdings at daily settlement prices reflected on a CFTC-registered futures exchange, consistent with the principles of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and U.S. GAAP.”

As for custody, the director clarified that since the fund will invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures, it “will not face the challenges presented by direct holdings of digital assets.” In addition, it is a closed-end interval fund which means it “will not offer daily redemptions and will not be subject to potentially large, unexpected liquidity demands over short periods.” Blass further described that “as an unlisted fund, its pricing will not depend on an efficient arbitrage mechanism and the willingness of market makers to make markets in a fund pursuing a digital asset strategy,” noting:

The fund also has taken steps to address issues related to potential manipulation in the digital asset markets.

“This includes prominent risk disclosures, offering the product only through registered investment advisers, and limiting the size and future growth of the fund, with an initial cap of $25 million,” the director concluded.

Over the past five years, the West African country has become the fastest-growing mobile money market on the continent. The burgeoning number of mobile money users is proof that digitized payments systems are providing a means for people to become financially active.

According to a 2019 economic analysis by the World Bank, the number of registered mobile money accounts in the country exploded from just 3.8 million to 23.9 million between 2012 and 2017.

The statistics alone speak volumes to the power of mobile networks in providing a means for previously unbanked or financially-excluded people to transact money remotely. Mobile phones are giving a large number of Ghanaians the chance to become financially active without having to use cash or card services.

The move to mobile payments has not gone unnoticed by the country’s central bank. At the end of November 2019, the Bank of Ghana announced plans to explore the use of a central bank digital currency in the new year.

Bank of Ghana governor Dr. Ernest Addison revealed that the bank has been working on a pilot project with a number of stakeholders to test the issuance and use of a digital currency. The announcement was made at Ghana’s National Banking Conference at the end of November. The move is an effort by the nation’s authorities to stay abreast of the increasing volume of mobile money users in Ghana and drive the digitization of its financial sector.

Crypto unregulated in Ghana

The surge in popularity and users of mobile money services in the country does not necessarily mean that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are enjoying the same level of success in Ghana.

Cryptocurrencies are currently unregulated in the West African nation, and there are no laws governing their use — a fact which has been confirmed by the Ghana Securities and Exchange Commission to Cointelegraph.

While the sector remains unregulated, the Ghana SEC issued a public warning to investors in March 2019. The note cautions investors to do their due diligence when dealing with unregistered or unlicensed trading platforms touting “high returns on investment.”

In its warning letter, the SEC listed 24 cryptocurrencies that have gained prominence worldwide, including BTC, ETH, LTC and XRP, while clearly stipulating that cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender in the country.

When asked for a general gauge of the level of interest in cryptocurrencies in Ghana, the SEC’s policy research department manager, Frank Donkor, told Cointelegraph that an in-depth market study has yet to be undertaken:

“We have not conducted a market survey to determine the interest in cryptocurrencies, however, as indicated in the public notice, people are attracted to it because of the promises of high returns on their investments.”

Donkor also dismissed various reports earlier this year by local media outlets that suggested the local SEC would consider licensing the use of cryptocurrencies. This will continue to remain a barrier to entry for cryptocurrency users in the country according to the official:

“There are no legislations backing the trading and use of cryptocurrencies in Ghana. Thus investors who tend to invest in such currencies or assets may be doing so at their own risk and are not protected under the Securities law regime in Ghana.”

Apathy toward cryptocurrency continues

There seems to be a certain amount of apathy toward cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in Ghana, evident in the blanket statement and public warnings issued earlier this year. The Ghana SEC’s belief that a major drawcard for using cryptocurrency is the promise of high returns on investments suggests that the body could be lacking knowledge about the technology and efficacy of the systems underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Omar Majdoub, president of registered non-profit organization Blockchain Society Ghana, believes that the general populace as well as policy makers in the country are ill-informed about the basics of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

According to Majdoub, there is a growing interest in the sector in the country, but misinformation has led many people to perceive all cryptocurrencies as fraudulent money-making schemes. He added that there is curiosity toward the applications of blockchain technology, but actual adoption of the technology is low.

Unsuspecting investors around the world have been duped by various crypto scams, and Ghana’s people are no exception. Majdoub suggests that an effort to protect the Ghanaian public from similar situations has led to the negative perception toward the sector in 2019:

“I believe government authorities are mostly under informed about cryptocurrencies, and Blockchain Society Ghana hopes to rectify that by having more dialogue. We hope to clarify the legitimate uses of crypto and how to distinguish from scams.”

Will Ghana’s CBDC be blockchain-based?

What remains to be seen is whether the Ghana Central Bank’s digital currency will be developed using blockchain infrastructure. Cointelegraph reached out to the Bank of Ghana to clarify the details of the pilot project for its central bank digital currency, but has not received an official response on the matter.

Given the current stance of the Ghanian SEC and its central bank, it seems unlikely that the project will be based on a blockchain platform. At the same time, the explosion of mobile money users in the country suggests that the medium could be a prime candidate to provide the infrastructure for the planned central bank digital currency.

Nevertheless, the possibility of an e-cedi being issued and available to the public in Ghana is a positive step toward providing a regulated, digitized form of payment in a country that has traditionally struggled with soaring inflation.","David Gray/Reuters

Binance Coin, or BNB, is the only major cryptocurrency outperforming bitcoin this year, but its namesake exchange is facing new concerns around increased competition, police raid rumors, and its ""burning"" practice.

The Binance exchange faced new scrutiny after it said in November it has no ""fixed offices in Shanghai or China"" following reports of a police raid in the country, Bloomberg first reported.

The exchange also destroys, or ""burns,"" a portion of BNB coins in circulation each quarter as part of a plan to slash supply in half.

Though Binance buys the coins off investors before destroying them, the practice likely serves as a factor in BNB's surge in 2019 and demand may wane once the burns reach their goal.

BNB's popularity as the leading exchange token now faces opposition from new firms looking to corner the initial-exchange-offering market.

Watch BNB trade live here.

Binance Coin is the only major cryptocurrency outperforming bitcoin this year, but its namesake exchange faces heightened scrutiny for its ""burning"" practice and police raid rumors.

The coin, typically referred to as BNB, allows holders to gain access to trading discounts and other benefits on Binance, the world's largest spot cryptocurrency exchange. BNB is up roughly 156% year-to-date, dwarfing bitcoin's 100% surge.

The digital coin's outperformance was first reported by Bloomberg.

The coin's run-up is likely boosted by the exchange's quarterly practice of destroying, or ""burning,"" BNB to reduce the number of tokens outstanding. Binance plans to burn half of the total BNB supply — about 100 million coins — before pausing the practice. Though it buys the coins from holders before destroying them, the practice drives BNB demand as users still look to use its benefits.

Binance destroyed $36.7 million worth of BNB at the end of the third quarter, or roughly 2 million coins. The exchange determines the amount of BNB to destroy based on its quarterly trading volume, and the latest burn hints the firm posted its most profitable quarter ever in the July-to-September period, Bloomberg reported.

The platform also enjoys looser regulatory scrutiny due to its registration in Malta, yet critics are calling for Binance to clarify rumors around a reported raid on offices in China. A spokesperson for the firm told Bloomberg it has no ""fixed offices in Shanghai or China,"" yet the rumored police search raised worries around whether the exchange is misleading investors to avoid China's crypto regulations.

BNB's surge cooled alongside other cryptos through the second half of the year, and a decline in initial exchange offerings on the platform could further hamper its performance. Binance customers used BNB to purchase coins sold by startups on the exchange, but as competitors with similar discount tokens crop up, Binance's popularity has faced new threats.

""BNB's large relative outperformance came in the first part of this year, as the IEO craze reached its peak,"" Travis Kling, who leads hedge fund Ikigai Asset Management, told Bloomberg. ""IEOs have cooled off a lot of its relative outperformance.""

BNB traded at $15.61 per coin at 3:10 p.m. ET. bitcoin traded at $7,456.46 per coin.

NOW WATCH: A big-money investor in juggernauts like Facebook and Netflix breaks down the '3rd wave' firms that are leading the next round of tech disruption","Ethereum has undergone a hard fork, dubbed “Istanbul,” in which six distinct upgrades have been added to the network at block number 9,069,000.

A hard fork refers to a radical change to a network’s underlying protocol that creates new rules defining which blocks and transactions the network will consider valid. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, the community has to work with each other as well as system developers to agree on which changes will be programmed into various clients, which, in Ethereum’s case, include Geth, Parity, and Nethermind. To date, the Ethereum network has undergone seven hard forks, including Constantinople, Spurious Dragon, and Byzantium.

Details

Istanbul contains six distinct upgrades, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP):

EIP-152: Add Blake2 compression function ‘F’ precompile

This EIP will make it possible for the BLAKE2b hash function to run cheaply on Ethereum. This will improve interoperability between Ethereum and Zcash, enabling contracts like trustless atomic swaps between chains and adding to the network’s privacy features. It will allow for tBTC equivalents but denominated in ZEC.

EIP-1108: Reduce alt_bn128 precompile gas costs

In 2018, the underlying library used by the official Go reference implementation to implement ECADD and ECMUL was changed to Cloudflare’s bn256 library, leading to performance gains. Decreasing the price of the precompiles will encourage the emergence of more privacy and scaling solutions on the network.

EIP-1344: ChainID opcode

The current approach is for client implementers to manually specify the chain ID at compile time, which has led to increased risks of human errors causing loss of funds or relay attacks. With this EIP, developers can access and validate the chain ID based on the proposed opcode as well as easily implementing chain ID changes.

EIP-1884: Repricing for trie-size-dependent opcodes

A number of opcodes have become more resource intensive due to the growth of the Ethereum network. This EIP will raise the gas cost for those opcodes in order to restore the balance between the price of an operation and the amount of resources it consumes.

EIP-2028: Transaction data gas cost reduction

This EIP will reduce the gas cost of Calldata from 68 gas per byte to 16 gas per byte. More data will be able to fit within a single block, which will result in higher bandwidth and increased scalability. Larger blocks also have security implications since there will be longer network delay associated with data transmission. As a result, fewer nodes will be generated within a given time and the cost of the network getting attacked will decrease.

EIP-2200: Net gas metering for SSTORE operations

This EIP proposes a structured definition of net gas metering on SSTORE. The resulting gas reduction scheme will enable contracts to add new functions such as re-entry locks and same-contract multi-send.

Logistics

Regular customers of an Ethereum-based exchange or wallet service do not need to take any action unless informed otherwise by their service provider.

Miners or node operators, on the other hand, have to upgrade their Ethereum client to the latest version in order to run Istanbul on Rinkeby, Goerli, and Ropsten. Otherwise, they will remain on an incompatible chain and will not be able to operate on the post-upgrade Ethereum network.

Developers should review all EIPs to determine if their current contract is affected by any of them. If so, they have to upgrade their contracts accordingly.","Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, is taking steps to expand into Turkey, an up-and-coming cryptocurrency market.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the company is establishing a team of a dozen full-time employees in the country.

Zhao said:

“Other than that we really want to invest in Turkey heavily. We also want to increase our team members somewhere between 10-20 people in the next 3 to 6 months. And if you’re looking for a job in the cryptocurrency industry please say hi to us.”

According to Coinhills, the Turkish lira is the fifth most traded national currencies for Bitcoin, just behind USD, JPY, EUR, and KRW.

Why Turkey?

During the interview, Zhao emphasized that the Turkish crypto community has a “high degree of understanding of blockchain,” adding that the local crypto community is very enthusiastic.

The enthusiasm is reflected by the volume of the local market, which has surpassed major regions like the U.K., Canada, and Singapore — all countries that have implemented better infrastructure earlier on.

The Statista Global Consumer Survey released in June 2019 also showed that Turkey had the highest number of respondents stating that they used or owned cryptocurrencies at some point.

For exchanges, especially for major trading platforms, it is a priority to identify a rapidly growing market and to focus on establishing a strong infrastructure in it to expand their reach.

Binance, for instance, has implemented the approach of expanding globally from one country to another since its inception, rather than trying to exclusively and dominantly target one market.

Does Turkey stand a chance against front runners?

Evolved crypto markets like Japan and South Korea have already laid solid regulatory frameworks to provide clarity to both exchanges and investors to a large extent.

Although the Turkish government has not taken a negative stance towards crypto assets, it also has not introduced clear policies to govern exchanges and oversee the local market.

Data suggests that a growing number of companies are actively working to expand into Turkey. But, for medium to long-term growth, it is critical that core areas of crypto regulation are addressed to create a more productive and efficient environment for businesses.

As major markets generally move towards complying with the standards of cryptocurrency regulation drafted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — a watchdog of the G7 — Turkey and other growing markets are expected to provide some form of regulatory clarity around crypto assets in the future.

2019-12-08,"3. How much Bitcoin will miners receive after the next halving?

Every new block will produce 6.25 BTC. At inception, the reward was eight times as much.

When Bitcoin was launched in 2009, miners were receiving 50 BTC per block. Thus, a total of 10,500,000 BTC was generated before the next halving took place in November 2012, when miners began to receive 25 BTC for each block.

It may seem like an overly generous bonus (more than $365,000 per block, based on current value), but the network was only just starting to develop at the time, and no one knew for certain whether people would continue to find the concept worthy of investing their computer processing power into the Bitcoin blockchain to keep it alive.

Another fact to take into account is that the all-time high market price for that period was $31 per BTC in June 2011, but that “bubble” later burst and Bitcoin was back to $2 before the year’s end. Nevertheless, mining has ultimately turned out to be much more profitable for those who got in early, which is a big part of the reason Bitcoin critics call it a Ponzi scheme.

The second Bitcoin halving occurred on July 6, 2016, as block number 420,000 was produced and miners began collecting 12.5 BTC for every new block, which is the current rate. The third halving will reduce that rate in half yet again, which will lower the block reward to just 6.25 BTC, or around $45,000 given the current market price.","Deutsche Bank Strategist Predicts Crypto Could Replace Fiat Money

Deutsche Bank analysts have made some predictions regarding the future of cryptocurrency. Strategist Jim Reid explained why cryptocurrencies are inevitable and how the existing fiat money system could crumble over the next decade, leading to soaring demand for cryptocurrencies.

‘The End of Fiat Money?’ – Cryptocurrencies Are Inevitable

Deutsche Bank Research released a special edition of Konzept entitled “Imagine 2030” on Thursday. Konzept is a regularly published research report that addresses the fundamental issues driving the world of economics and finance. In the 84-page special edition, Deutsche Bank analysts discussed contrarian ideas of how the 2020s may evolve.

Jim Reid, Global Head of Fundamental Credit, Strategy and Thematic Research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in the report: “While critics bemoan cryptocurrencies as constrained by regulatory hurdles, we believe the incentives of governments and card providers are such that digital currencies are inevitable.” He authored the section of the report entitled “The end of fiat money?” Reid detailed:

The forces that have held the current fiat system together now look fragile and they could unravel in the 2020s. If so, that will start to lead to a backlash against fiat money and demand for alternative currencies, such as gold or crypto could soar.

Cryptocurrencies Could Replace Cash

One of the sections of the report discusses cryptocurrencies as “the 21st century cash.” Marion Laboure authored this section, with contribution from Anthony Chaimowitz, Market Research Lead for the EMEA and APAC regions at the bank. “Until now, cryptocurrencies have been additions, rather than substitutes, to the global inventory of money,” Laboure explained, asserting that “Over the next decade, this may change.” She elaborated:

Overcoming regulatory hurdles will broaden their appeal and raise the potential to eventually replace cash.

Laboure provided a comparison between the adoption rates of cryptocurrencies and the internet by examining the number of Blockchain wallet users and the number of internet users over multiple years. “It is early days but the curves are similar after adjusting for scale,” she claims. “Indeed, if current trends continue, there could be 200m blockchain wallet users in 2030.”

To achieve widespread adoption, Laboure believes that cryptocurrencies must become legitimate in the eyes of governments and regulators. They must also “allow for global reach in the payment market.” Furthermore, “To do this, alliances must be forged with key stakeholders – mobile apps such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, card providers such as Visa and Mastercard, and retailers, such as Amazon and Walmart,” she opined. “If these challenges can be overcome, the eventual future of cash is at risk.” Laboure continued:

As we look to the decade ahead, it would not be surprising if a new and mainstream cryptocurrency were to unexpectedly emerge.

“Cryptocurrencies may constitute the best tool for a digital war,” she added, pointing out that some countries with historically-strong banking industries are already trialing them. “The question is which country will take advantage of being the first to obtain licenses and build alliances. As that occurs, the line between cryptocurrencies, financial institutions, and public and private sectors may become blurred,” she concluded.

The company will install 70 units next year, each with a capacity of about 1 megawatt (MW), Chase Lochmiller, CEO of Crusoe, told Bloomberg in an interview published Saturday. Crusoe has also raised $70 million in fresh capital to fund its projects.

Announced Friday, the new capital comes from two rounds - $30 million in equity funding and $40 million in project financing. The equity round was led by existing investor Bain Capital Ventures and new investor The KCK Group, with participation from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Winklevoss Capital and Polychain Capital. The $40 million round was led by New York-based credit fund Upper90.



Winklevoss Capital also participated in Crusoe's $4.5 million seed round in May, which was led by Bain Capital Ventures.

Gas flaring

Through its projects, including bitcoin mining facility, Crusoe aims to solve the growing problem of gas flaring, where energy companies burn off excess gas in the absence of adequate pipeline capacity. Citing data from the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, Crusoe said nearly 497 billion cubic feet of natural gas are flared annually in the U.S., which is enough gas to power over 10 million homes.

With its bitcoin mining farm, for instance, Crusoe plans to utilize about 10 million cubic feet a day of gas which otherwise would have got wasted, Lochmiller told Bloomberg. “It’s a very creative way to solve an environmental and economic problem for the oil and gas industry,” Alex Urdea, the chief investment officer of Upper90, was quoted as saying in the report.

Crusoe plans to deploy up to 40 Digital Flare Mitigation (DFM) systems through the first half of 2020, per the announcement. The company currently has flare mitigation projects operating in three oilfields - Wyoming's Powder River Basin, Colorado's Denver-Julesburg, and North Dakota and Montana's Bakken. Crusoe said its DFM systems are scalable up to millions of cubic feet per day and can be deployed anywhere in the U.S. or Canada.

Is the U.S. becoming a new China?

The U.S. appears to be becoming another China for cryptocurrency mining. Just last month, two firms - Whinstone US Inc. and Northern Bitcoin AG, merged to open a 100-acre bitcoin mining farm in the Texas state. Chinese mining giant Bitmain also recently launched a 50-megawatt farm, also in Texas, calling it “the world’s largest for bitcoin mining.” Digital Currency Group-backed firm Layer1 also recently raised $50 million to build mining chips and to run its own electricity substations in Texas.

The Block recently reported that one advantage of bitcoin mining in Texas is its abundant power resources and cheap electricity prices. But that’s not the main reason bitcoin miners are flocking to the state. Rather, regulatory stability is the key driver, several industry participants told The Block at the time. “In China, mining is a dirty business,” said Leo Zhang, research lead at Iterative Capital, referring to the fact that bitcoin miners in China usually need to have a deep understanding of the local political and social culture, and possess a substantial social network to set up their mining business.

Yet, around 70% of the crypto mining market is currently dominated by Chinese miners and the top 5 known mining pools are also all based in China.","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recently released instructions for computing taxes involving crypto assets. The digital market has been waiting for this report since May 2019 after the Revenue’s chief Chuck Rettig hinted at an update to the existing regulations. In April 2019, some members of Congress wrote to Rettig seeking clarification regarding crypto reporting requirements and related tax consequences.

The guidance consists of a revenue ruling section and FAQs. According to Rettig, the IRS is dedicated to increasing citizens’ understanding of their tax requirements in this developing sector. The new directive, he added, would enable taxpayers and industry professionals to understand how prevailing tax principles fit into the ever-changing scene.

What’s more, the authority would shed some light on the relevant reporting requirements and ensure fair implementation of tax regulations. Although the guidance addresses Federal income taxes, states might soon observe these rules. Some of the highlighted issues include tax liabilities from crypto forks, computing taxable gains during cryptocurrency sales and how to estimate cryptocurrency earnings.

Forks

The document states that new digital currencies developed from a current Blockchain fork should be considered as normal income equivalent to the new coin’s market price when received. This is only possible if you are in control of the coins. While a hard fork arises when coins in a shared ledger shift, a soft fork is from a protocol switch that does not divert the ledger, hence, does not create another cryptocurrency.

As such, holding digital coins before hard forks or immediately after is free of tax penalties. However, a new cryptocurrency’s airdrop after a hard fork incurs tax on the airdrop’s value. An airdrop spreads crypto units to multiple users’ ledger addresses.

Determining Cost Basis

It also explains how to find the market price of currencies earned from mining and selling goods and services. When it comes to the cost basis, add the cash spent on buying the coins to the other acquisition costs in U.S. dollars. In addition, the document explains how to work out the cost basis for every crypto unit disposed of through a taxable deal.

Take the example of an investor who has bought bitcoins through different transactions over the years. During the sale, it will be unclear which buying price to use when computing taxable gains. A coin’s price determines its value when bought at an exchange. Income basis, therefore, comprises of fees and similar purchase costs.

When buying the cryptocurrency at a peer to peer (P2P) exchange, you can establish its market value using a price index. According to the IRS, this could be an explorer that checks global crypto indices and computes coin values at a particular date and time. Users distinguish the coins they are selling by recording distinct labels such as addresses or private and public keys. Alternatively, they can use the transaction registers of all units.

Past Guidance

This report borrows from a similar IRS directive in 2014. Dubbed Notice 2014-21, the document contains 16 FAQs explaining the relevance of general tax concepts in crypto transactions. It describes a crypto coin as a digital symbol of value functioning as an accounting unit, mode of exchange and store of value.

Although digital coins act as real currency in certain environments, they lack legal tender status. Virtual currency is considered a capital asset only if it is convertible to cash. For example, users can buy bitcoins or convert them into currencies like the Euro and the U.S. dollar. Needless to say, capital gains principles cover both profits and losses.

Gifts and Contributions

Suppose virtual currency is exchanged as a gift. The giver does not incur taxes. The gifted individual, on the other hand, will not earn from it unless they sell or exchange it. It is prudent to note that business gifts do not apply. When it comes to donations, the charges are equivalent to the currency’s value if the period you held it exceeded one year.

Defaulters

The IRS notes that some users have not reported their earnings nor paid the resulting taxes. Similarly, others have given incorrect information about their transactions. Therefore, the commission is using methods such as audits, tax literacy and criminal investigations to tackle non-compliance.

In July 209, for example, the authority declared that it had sent letters to over 10,000 citizens who submitted false crypto transactions or failed to report their activities altogether. Such offenses could attract penalties, interests and even criminal prosecution. Investors should, therefore, document transactions such as sales, receipts, and exchanges to determine their tax returns.

Featured image via BigStock.","CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA – At exactly 12:29 EST on Thursday, a crypto wallet built by developers at SpaceChain hurtled into the stratosphere aboard a Falcon 9 rocket.

When it arrived at the International Space Station, the 1kg node – only a fraction of SpaceX CRS-19 resupply mission’s 2,600kg payload – became the first active bitcoin node on the ISS.

For SpaceChain, the launch is a step forward in its mission of building out a robust, decentralized blockchain infrastructure high above the Earth. The wallet will be beyond any country’s jurisdiction – and well above the reach of any physical hardware hacks.

SpaceChain sees its nodes as a radical new way to make crypto transactions more secure. This is the three-year-old company’s third launch and its first from American soil. The other two launches blasted off from China.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The wallet will play a small but important part in that long-term goal, said to Zee Zheng, SpaceChain’s CEO and co-founder. Once the astronauts aboard the ISS install it, the node will operate for about a year securing multi-signature transactions through the ISS data feed.

We met with Zheng over margaritas at a Mexican joint overlooking the famed Floridian Space Coast. More than half of his team had congregated in Florida to watch the launch. He was ecstatic.

This launch had been the 23-person company’s full-time focus for much of 2019 and it was a milestone they’ve been shooting for since they first proposed it 18 months ago.

“We put all the company’s resources into it,” said Zheng. SpaceChain declined to state how much payload space and research and development cost. They contracted through Nanoracks, whose CEO Jeffrey Manber is also a SpaceChain advisor.

It is fundamentally different from the other two nodes SpaceChain has put into orbit.

“For us, it’s kind of tricky,” said Zheng. “There’s no existing space-tested hardware available, so even to install our own software we needed to make major changes.”

Building a space wallet was one thing; making it compliant for use on the ISS was something completely different. SpaceChain’s open-source protocol had to be vetted by NASA and retrofitted for the station’s unique plug architecture, Zheng said

Zheng said that having Jeff Garzik as SpaceChain’s Chief Technical Officer helped in that regard. Garzik was one of the early bitcoin core developers and he led SpaceChain’s effort to build out the software soon to be integrated with the ISS. He’s also been thinking about blockchain in space even before SpaceChain founded, said Zheng.

“About five years ago in the bitcointalk forum, Jeff wrote an article about bitcoin in space,” said Zheng. “It’s been his dream for a while.”

This launch is a far cry from their first space project: a Raspberry Pi equipped with a Qtum node that the company launched from China’s Gobi desert in February 2018.

Their second launch, also from China, was slightly more developed. That hardware could run blockchain dapps on the SpaceChain OS and it communicated directly with the ground.

This new wallet will operate independently of SpaceChain’s past launches. It will not communicate with the previous nodes and all comms will route through the ISS feed to ground. This means the device will have a slower connection and it will take hours, not minutes for any single transaction to complete.

“We actually want to make slower,” said Zheng, who described this crawling pace as a feature, not a bug.

“We see so many crypto exchanges get hacked. And within two minutes the funds – millions of dollars – get transferred. By utilizing this channel we can not only secure transactions,” but have a chance to intercept suspicious activity, he said.

This could appeal to high-dollar clients – custodial services, exchanges, and enterprise customers, said Zheng, who are more than willing to trade a few extra hours for added peace of mind.

The node will live alongside a number of other experiments sent up to the ISS including Anheuser Busch’s study of how sugars malt in space and an experiment to test of the effects microgravity has on genetically modified super-mice.

Only a few months ago it received a 60,000 euro grant from the European Space Agency. Zheng said the exposure that comes with NASA and SpaceX will help it grow to the larger mission.

But he insists SpaceChain is rocket agnostic. It’s willing to contract with any agency, anywhere, whenever the time is right. NASA and SpaceX happened to be the ideal partners for the Dec. 5 launch, just as Chinese partners were for their first two. Future launches won’t necessarily be.

“Actually, next March we’re going to use an Indian rocket,” said Zheng, referring to one of the two SpaceChain launches he says is coming in the next 18 months.

In 10 years, perhaps, SpaceChain will deploy a network of dedicated satellites that “speak to each other” and run far more blockchain infrastructure than any single ISS wallet ever could, said Zheng. Until then, Zheng said he and SpaceChain will continue to rally toward its orbital goal.

One of the most interesting recent developments in cryptocurrency is the emergence of decentralized liquidity pools.

Algorithmic-based smart contract liquidity pools such as Ethereum’s Uniswap, or privacy-focused, off-chain decentralized exchanges such as Starkware’s StarkDEX are just two examples of projects leading the charge.

Inbound/outbound liquidity is essential for the creation and growth of financial markets. Price discovery, and the ability to move in and out of trade positions, whether they’re from a big institutional firm, or a small-time trader, remains key if crypto is to reach maturity; where its aggregate daily volume could sustain at levels comparable to the legacy financial system.

It is not exactly a secret that the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries have a liquidity problem. Large trades in all but the most popular assets move the market to an alarming degree. This volatility then causes a cascade of ills.

First, it decreases the credibility of the markets due to the reality or appearance of manipulation.

Second, it makes people nervous about holding assets, meaning that applications dependent on low volatility have trouble getting off the ground.

Third, it harms the viability of decentralized exchanges and other decentralized token economies because insofar as they depend on slow mainnets, they lag badly behind the price information available on faster, more efficient centralized exchanges.

Decentralized payments are just one piece of the puzzle of what it really means to be decentralized, as you’ll also need the assistance of decentralized liquidity to build and extend additional functional financial layers on top of your blockchain-related protocol/application. Liquidity is king, and it can make or break your protocol if you cannot rally sufficient liquidity to aid in your project’s growth and enable the use cases you sought out to provide your end-users.

With the proliferation of decentralized lending, borrowing, and more, the current decentralized landscape appears to be grasping the basic essentials necessary for the financial instruments we’ve grown familiar with in traditional legacy markets (Compound Finance is but one example). To better understand where we’re at, let’s first go deeper into what solutions the industry has concocted thus far.

Liquidity pools

To begin, liquidity pools could help address a key problem faced by new token-based projects: the need to arduously bootstrap a liquidity-providing network before the project has real utility. Liquidity pools can mitigate this by providing a unique, less-speculative reason for people to hold tokens that do not have a large user base yet (i.e., to provide liquidity for a fee).

Moreover, the existence of decentralized liquidity pools provides added reassurance to large investors in young projects who do not want to get stuck trying to unload their tokens in an illiquid market. The pools thus function somewhat like insurance for token holders (we’ll cover this idea more below).

Second, liquidity pools should be considered an impressive achievement in decentralized institution-building. Liquidity has long been a central concern, not only for cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, but for financial markets in general. It is a prerequisite for the growth of a whole range of other institutions, financial and otherwise.

And, decentralized liquidity provisioning is emerging through a mechanism that does not exist in traditional financial markets — automated smart contracts. This is a totally new vector of provisioning liquidity, which opens up the possibility of broader, more competitive involvement in market-making. Liquidity pools are thus a bellwether of maturation for decentralized cryptocurrency markets.

The total quantity of liquidity in these decentralized pools remains small by the standards of conventional markets (which can trade daily with volumes exceeding hundreds of billions in USD), but it is growing at a fairly impressive pace.

Here is an accounting of the total USD value locked in Uniswap contracts, from https://defipulse.com/uniswap:

The total USD value locked in Uniswap contracts, from https://defipulse.com/uniswap.

It is also worth taking a closer look at a few of the leading liquidity pool providers. Their mechanics vary, and are not always terribly straightforward. However, they represent important opportunities for investors to analyze. And if they continue to grow, they could alter the calculus for large investors interested in cryptocurrency markets but concerned about liquidity risks.

Uniswap

Uniswap has emerged as a leader in the decentralized liquidity space. Their contracts are simply pools of 50% ETH and 50% some target asset. Traders buy either asset directly from the contract, causing the prices to move algorithmically. When differences emerge between the algorithmically-determined price offered by the contract and the market price, arbitrageurs close the gap. Anyone can replenish liquidity in the contracts by contributing an equal amount of ETH and the target asset. Doing so entitles them to a pro-rata share of the trading fees (0.3% per trade) that accumulate in the contract.

This piece provides an excellent starting framework for understanding the basic bet implied by supplying liquidity to a Uniswap contract. A deeper dive can be found here as well.

Bancor

Bancor built the first meaningful decentralized liquidity solution. However, it has been losing ground because it suffers from several technical disadvantages, and is also dependent on its own token (making its solution less elegant than Uniswap’s architecture).

The biggest problem faced by liquidity suppliers to pools like Uniswap is the risk of major relative price movements between the paired assets; if the price of an asset in a trading pair surged suddenly, it could cause a ripple effect of negative counter-trades from a lack of proper liquidity. It is therefore ideal to supply liquidity in terms of a stable asset, instead of a volatile one like ETH. This problem is exacerbated by Bancor’s dependence on its native token, BNT, which is even less stable/liquid than ETH, while also adding the complexity of another abstracted token to maintain.

Moreover, transactions on Bancor are structured in such a way that they can incur high gas fees, and they are not presently planning to utilize layer 2 scaling technologies to alleviate those pains.

Bancor is working to address these issues instead by introducing a new stablecoin to replace BNT as the basis of its liquidity pools, as well as a few other upgrades. It remains to be seen whether the effort will succeed. It would appear though that an algorithmic approach such as Uniswap, paired with a tightly-coupled asset like ETH or another ETH-built stablecoin, is probably the best approach until further improvements emerge in the industry.

[Other projects like Kyber Network and the 0x Project focus on cross-chain liquidity and possess their own ERC20 asset — but they fall outside the scope of this post.]

Balancer

Balancer is only a whitepaper for now. But it details a protocol that would allow people to easily instantiate new liquidity pools, backed by larger, more flexible sets of assets, with more precisely calibrated algorithmic incentives and user-determined transactions. If it takes off, it could encourage much broader participation in providing liquidity.

Convexity

Described in a recent whitepaper, the Convexity Protocol may turn out to be an important accelerant of decentralized liquidity provision. By allowing anyone to easily write collateralized options contracts, and sell those contracts in the form of an ERC20 token (oTokens), it will allow more sophisticated forms of hedging to occur without an intermediating institution. While the Convexity Protocol could have a nearly infinite range of possible uses, one of the most obvious is as liquidity insurance. Would-be liquidity providers in new markets will have a bit less to fear when they can use relatively stable assets as their base pair, insuring against collapses in the liquidity of their target market.

Obviously, there is no free lunch. In a sense, it is possible to think of Convexity Protocol as “spreading” risk from riskier markets into more stable ones. Nonetheless, if the fundamentals of participation continue to improve, tools such as this could speed the arrival of meaningful decentralized liquidity in a wider range of assets.

Unipig and StarkDEX

It is important to notice the connection between liquidity and network capacity/throughput. The inability of the main Ethereum chain to rapidly settle high volumes of transactions is a fundamental impediment to liquidity providers, because the ability to quickly remove liquidity is a driver of willingness to provide liquidity in the first place. (For a deeper dive into the nuances of this dynamic, take a look at the CFTC’s report about the 2010 “Flash Crash”).

Therefore, one of the most important fronts in the battle to unlock decentralized liquidity is the development of Layer-2 and off-chain solutions for the rapid settlement of a high volume of trades. Two of the most interesting projects in this space are Unipig and StarkDEX. They both promise vastly increased network capacity and execution time, but take different routes to get there.

Unipig, currently live in demo form, allows transactions to be posted in real time and high volume to aggregators running fully functional Uniswap contracts, which are then “rolled up” and posted to the main chain. Parties’ trust in the veracity of these aggregators’ reporting is backed by a bond that dishonest aggregators stand to lose. This is a simple scaling solution whose success with real money at stake will depend upon effective auditing of aggregators. We suspect that the Unipig team will get the auditing and verification mechanisms right, but there is still some uncertainty about whether large institutional players will ever feel comfortable supplying liquidity through this channel. Still, we think their approach of scaling Uniswap via layer 2 technologies and optimistic roll-ups remains one of the most adept approaches yet seen; without the use of SNARKs/STARKs, more developers will be able to learn how to utilize their setup more quickly.

StarkDEX, on the other hand, uses state-of-the-art cryptographic STARK proofs to take on-chain transactions, process them off-chain, and then batch them back on-chain in order to increase throughput. The challenges of this method are purely technical, rather than social, as with Unipig (where you just have to get others to supply more liquidity over time). Running on testnet it appears to increase transaction volumes by more than 100x versus the main chain, with correspondingly decreased gas costs.

It is not obvious to us how the trade timing constraints it imposes will interact with the needs of major liquidity providers, or how quickly their solution will be adopted by other major players. That said, it is a very promising step towards orders-of-magnitude better throughput and major new opportunities for decentralized liquidity provision, and could likely play a pivotal role in the creation of scalable dark pools — with few or no trust assumptions

The Liquidity backbone

Plenty of parties have tried (and will continue to try) to “shortcut” the liquidity problem by providing liquidity from some concentrated or centralized venue. But this only highlights the deep connection between liquidity and the decentralization ethos itself.

Any financial system is, in a sense, only as decentralized as the sources of its liquidity. After all, if there are no central banks, but instead a handful of whales acting as central banks, what exactly has improved?

When provided from a wide range of parties whose behavior is deeply uncorrelated, liquidity is fundamentally more robust: it is less likely to evaporate in a crisis and more indicative of a healthy market.",,
2019-12-09,"Well, folks, it’s almost that time of year again. Q4 is drawing to a close, chestnuts are roasting on an open fire, and Bitcoin investors closely watching to see if Rudolph’s nose will flash red or green in the days leading up to the end of the year; after all, it could be time for a good ol’ Bitcoin Santa Rally.

A “Santa Rally” or “Santa Claus Rally”–which actually is not, in fact, unique to Bitcoin or even cryptocurrency–is when there is a sustained increase during the price of an asset throughout the last week of December and into the first two trading days in January.

What causes “Santa Rallies” to happen?

Investopedia explains that there are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. One theory points to sentimental causes–that holiday cheer and holiday bonuses result in an injection of new capital into the market.

A more practical theory explains that the cause is likely the fact that institutional investors–who tend to be pessimistic–go on vacation around this time of year, leaving the markets to retail investors (while the cat’s away, the mice will play.)

This phenomenon is well-documented outside of the crypto world. Over 65% of Decembers since the 1960s have resulted in positive gains for shareholders. However, within the cryptosphere, which is just over ten years old, the phenomenon has also been observed.

For example, on December 1 of 2017, the price of BTC was roughly $10,840; by January 1, 2018, the price had risen to roughly $13,902 (though Bitcoin had risen to nearly $20,000 midway through the month, and a severe price crash followed soon after.) The year prior to that (2016), BTC was roughly $750 on December 1 and $970 on January 1, 2017. 2015 to 2016 also saw an increase from $360 to $430.

However, the Santa rally is not a guarantee–take, for example, last year. On December 1, 2018, BTC was hovering around $4,240; on January 1, it had fallen to $3,750, although the price had fallen as low as $3,200 in mid-December. Similarly, from 2013-2014, Bitcoin recovered from a mid-December crash to roughly $420 to $770 by the first of the year, though it had started the month at roughly $1,000.

What’s in store for this year?

An inflection point approaches

Last Monday, Bloomberg predicted that Bitcoin was approaching an “inflection point” as the price was continuing to fall toward the lower limit its Trading Envelope Indicator.

“The gauge smooths moving averages to map out higher and lower limits, with a break below the lower band potentially preceding a retreat similar to the one seen on Sept. 24, when the coin fell 12% in one day,” the article said. “A bounce off the lower limit, on the other hand, could signal support at that level and, possibly, a rally similar to the one seen on Oct. 25, when Bitcoin posted a 15% gain.”

Since that piece was posted, the price of Bitcoin has risen from roughly $7,280 to approximately $7,500 at press time. But where could it go from here?

Willy Woo: “on-chain momentum is crossing into bullish”

Cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo Tweeted on Saturday, December 7, that he has observed a trend reversal toward a more bullish sentiment in the price of BTC. Specifically, Woo wrote that “on-chain momentum is crossing into bullish,” and pointed toward the upcoming “halvening.”

On-chain momentum is crossing into bullish. Prep for halvening front running here on in. Can’t say what this indicator is, as it’s proprietary to @AdaptiveFund, but it tracks investor momentum. The bottom is mostly likely in, anything lower will be just a wick in the macro view. pic.twitter.com/WqiPRpweUv — Willy Woo (@woonomic) December 7, 2019

“Halvening,” or “halving,” is a term that refers to the instances when BTC mining rewards are cut in half. On the Bitcoin network, halving happens regularly at preset intervals of every 210,000 blocks. This is built into the Bitcoin protocol; the next halvening is scheduled for May 14.

I only tweet when I’m at high confidence, else it erodes my rep. — Willy Woo (@woonomic) December 7, 2019

While there’s not a direct correlation between halvenings and the price of BTC, increases in BTC’s valuation have often followed.

The most popular theory behind these price increases seem to be that fewer mining rewards result in less cryptocurrency is being mined. The increased scarcity that results from the decrease in mining drives the price of that cryptocurrency up. Therefore, if miners have less incentive to keep doing their work, less coins will be mined, and the coins that are mined will be more valuable.

“The 1000 whales that control 50% of all bitcoin don’t care about on-chain [transactions].”

However, entrepreneur Charles Fuchs tweeted in response to Woo that on-chain transactions only tell a part of the story: “the 1000 whales that control 50% of all bitcoin don’t care about on-chain [transactions],” he wrote.

The 1000 whales that control 50% of all bitcoin don’t care about on chain 🙌🏼😂😂 — Charles Fuchs 🔰 (STACKIN) (@charlesfuchs) December 7, 2019

In other words, the massive amounts of cryptocurrency that are traded off of the Bitcoin blockchain often aren’t immediately reflected in the markets. Therefore, making observations and predictions of on-chain volume can only be effective to a certain extent.

Bearish opinions

However, according to cryptocurrency analyst Eric Thies, things aren’t looking up for Bitcoin. “$BTC is done for a while…short the corn,” he wrote on Twitter.

Yikes. I’m taking the hint this time guys.. $BTC is done for a while. This squashes some bullish sentiment i was feeling yesterday ….the purpose and reason I built this tool was to eliminate my emotion in analysis and it’s pretty clear I need to listen to it. Short the corn. pic.twitter.com/AiVLec0sUs — CryptoThies 📈 (@KingThies) December 1, 2019

However, in response to a Tweet by @CredibleCrypto, Thies acknowledged that it’s possible that the sell signal will have disappeared by the end of the month.

I’m down for that 😘 — CryptoThies 📈 (@KingThies) December 2, 2019

Mitoshi Kaku, technical Analyst and Creator of The “Waves & Particles Trading System” at Ikagi, responded critically to this:

So you told everyone to short on a 1M candle signal, at the opening of the candle, even knowing that signal won’t be certain until the end of the month? Come on dude, you have a big following don’t mess with them like that! 🙄 — Mitoshi Kaku 👨🏻‍🚀 (@CryptoSays) December 7, 2019

Charles Hoskinson says “crypto is unstoppable”; Tom Lee sees possible positive motion from new money and China

But while a Santa Rally could yield some positive short-term results, what are experts saying about the long term?

Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum and the creator of Cardano, seems unabashedly bullish about what’s in store for cryptocurrency. “ We will see 10k btc again and welcome 100k,” he wrote last week. “Crypto is unstoppable. Crypto is the future.”

Bitcoin’s price is going down? Remember everyone, after the FUD, news trading and manipulation clears out, we still have a global movement that’s going to change the world. We will see 10k btc again and welcome 100k. Crypto is unstoppable. Crypto is the future pic.twitter.com/9vlgH4S7u2 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 22, 2019

However, Tom Lee, Managing Partner and the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, also seems to be fairly confident about the future.

“I think bitcoin’s weakness since July is understandable,” he said recently to CNBC. “I don’t think adoption has really grown since July and if you can’t grow adoption, network effects don’t take place and so bitcoin drifts lower. But does this change the 10-year, five-year, or even two-year outlook for bitcoin? I don’t think so.”

Lee noted that the increasing availability of institutional-grade investment products and services in crypto could bring new money into the space, and that China’s increased interest in blockchain technology could be good for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Writing in its research report Imagine 2030, Deutsche Bank said that the structure that keeps fiat currency in place could crumble, allowing cryptocurrency to rise to replace it.

“The forces that hold the fiat money system together look fragile, particularly decades of low labour costs. Over the next decade, some of these forces could begin to unravel and demand for alternative currencies, from gold to crypto, could take off,” the banking giant wrote in the report.

“Until now, cryptocurrencies have been additions, rather than substitutes, to the global inventory of money. Over the next decade, this may change. Overcoming regulatory hurdles will broaden their appeal and raise the potential to eventually replace cash.”

Cryptocurrency will replace cash, say blockchain experts

The Deutsche Bank predictions have been welcomed by the blockchain industry, which – perhaps unsurprisingly – sees crypto as the future of currency.

“Cryptocurrency definitely has the potential to replace cash within the next 10 years,” said Peter Wood, CEO of CoinBurp.

“Mass adoption of blockchain wallet holders following a public decline in cash use, wavering distrust in modern day banks and a fragile fiat system, is only set to increase as the legitimacy and popularity of digital currencies continues its skywards trajectory.”

The increasing interest of major technology companies in cryptocurrency, such as Facebook with the launch of Libra, is likely to help move crypto into greater mainstream use. However, there are still significant hurdles to overcome.

“They must become legitimate in the eyes of governments and regulators. That means bringing stability to the price and bringing advantages to both merchants and consumers,” said Marion Laboure, lecturer in Economics & Finance at Harvard University, writing in the Deutsche Bank report.

“They must also allow for global reach in the payment market. To do this, alliances must be forged with key stakeholders – mobile apps such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, card providers such as Visa and Mastercard, and retailers, such as Amazon and Walmart.”

However, this is an issue that Wood believes the industry can overcome.

“With proper regulation and guidelines in place, cryptocurrency can serve as a powerful digital alternative for businesses and individuals to utilise for increased security, speed and efficiency over traditional banking transactions.”

Cryptocurrency in 2020: Laying the foundations

For all of this to happen, the next year is set to be critical for the cryptocurrency industry, and according to Kiran Raj, CEO of Bittrex Global, there are a number of key changes that are set to occur in 2020.

The first of these is the diversification of digital assets, with digital tokens used for non-payment purposes becoming more distinct from conventional cryptocurrencies.

“For much of its history, blockchain has been synonymous with cryptocurrency, the most prevalent and prominent use case of distributed ledger technology. There is a significant growth runway for cryptocurrencies in their own right, but they are not the beginning and end of the emerging digital asset economy,” said Raj.

“In 2020 we expect to start seeing more of the next stage – towards digital tokens as vehicles for a wider range of underlying assets, from property to equities. Over time, the advantages of digital asset trading – in cost, speed and efficiency – have the potential to convert those who might not initially believe a physical asset can be safely transacted via a digital token.”

Regulation is also set to crystallise in some areas, paving the way for future legislation on the industry.

“Regulation in its own right is likely to be one of the prevailing blockchain trends in 2020. January will mark the formal arrival of Liechtenstein’s Blockchain Act, one of the most advanced regulatory regimes for the industry in the world – one that balances support for innovation with importance advances in customer and asset protection,” he said.

“Where Liechtenstein is leading, others are set to eventually follow. And this will mark the shift of the blockchain, and specifically cryptocurrency, market from an unregulated one which has attracted a justifiably poor reputation in some corners, to the kind of regulated industry that can provide a stable home for investor capital.”

And finally, there is the evolving role of major organisations – from governments to big tech – in cryptocurrency.

“2019 has been a year in which institutional involvement in blockchain has started to grow. We are seeing a combination of opportunism and caution, with the industry under growing political scrutiny,” said Raj.

This year we have seen questions raised – is big tech the right vehicle for cryptocurrency, how can governments best regulate an emerging industry, what will the role of central banks be? In 2020, we can expect more answers, and greater clarity about how state and corporate institutions intend to approach both the opportunities and challenges of the token economy and blockchain technology.”

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has finalized and put in use a new tax form that requires crypto owners to declare whether they received, bought, sold, exchanged, or acquired any cryptocurrencies in 2019. Tax experts are frustrated at the vagueness of the tax agency, with some questioning whether the answers would increase the chances of being audited by the IRS.

New Tax Form With Crypto Question

The IRS published a new tax form containing a question about cryptocurrency on Thursday. The Schedule 1 form is part of the 1040 tax form for U.S. taxpayers to declare “Additional Income and Adjustments to Income.” The IRS first unveiled the draft of this form in October, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. The form is now finalized and posted on the IRS website for use in filing 2019 tax returns. Form 1040 is used by over 152 million U.S. tax filers. The first question on the new Schedule 1 reads:

At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?

What Will the IRS Do?

The crypto question at the beginning of the new tax form has the crypto community guessing the IRS’ intention, what it will do with the information, and what exactly needs to be declared. A tax expert told CNBC that “The inquiry itself is a vague one.”

Sarah-Jane Morin, a partner at Morgan Lewis in San Francisco, told the publication, “As a taxpayer myself, I find this question very frustrating because it isn’t clear.” She pointed out that moving one’s own cryptocurrency from one wallet to another could be considered “sending.” Morin concluded that “The most conservative approach that a taxpayer can take is to consider any interaction you’ve had with virtual currency and whether there’s any way this can fall under this very broad list of what you could’ve engaged in during 2019.”

Jeffrey Levine, a CPA and director of financial planning at Blueprint Wealth Alliance in New York, was quoted by the news outlet as saying:

The biggest thing is that the IRS is asking this for a reason, and my question is how much have you increased your audit risk by checking ‘Yes’ in response?

The IRS has a history of being vague when it comes to taxing crypto transactions. The agency released new tax guidelines in October to supplement its previous guidance issued in 2014. However, while the new guidance answers some questions, it also raises several more, especially regarding how hard forks and airdrops are taxed. In November, two attorneys in the IRS Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting) attempted to answer some questions regarding hard forks and like-kind exchanges.

IRS Increases Focus on Crypto

The IRS has been increasing its efforts to find and tax crypto owners. The agency’s Criminal Investigation Annual Report 2019 released last week outlines its efforts and progress in finding and convicting crypto tax evaders. The IRS wrote:

Cryptocurrencies are undermining the financial and tax system.

“Companies pay employees in cryptocurrency or receive crypto for goods/services,” the tax agency continued. “They do not pay taxes and entities shift income to offshore exchanges with no reporting requirements, utilizing exchanges with little to no AML practices.” The IRS added, “Understanding the advancements in this area and staying on top of the criminal methodologies is our bread and butter.”

While admitting that its resources are limited, the IRS believes that it has the tools and ability to find crypto tax evaders. Cyber criminals “now deal in cryptocurrency, again thinking this will make them anonymous, but our agents have once again proved that there is nowhere to hide. We will not stop in our pursuit,” the report reads. In July, the tax agency sent more than 10,000 letters to crypto users reminding them of their tax obligations.

The IRS’ report also highlights the achievements of its collaboration with international partners, the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement or J5. The group comprises the IRS Criminal Investigation and its counterparts in the U.K., Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands. The J5 focuses on international tax evasion including the use of cryptocurrency to evade international tax obligations. The IRS further wrote:

In just 18-months, we are already seeing the benefits to this group both in the development of new tools and in the numbering of real cases. We expect our first operational results from this group in FY20.

A new crypto ratings index from China’s Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID) is out.

The government-sponsored index ranks the top crypto assets based on three key factors – tech, applicability and creativity.

The index places a premium on smart contract platforms, with EOS, Ethereum and Tron taking the first, second and third spots, respectively.

Other leading cryptocurrencies by market cap are much further down the list, with Bitcoin at #9, Stellar Lumens at #10, and XRP at #18.

Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are even further down the list, at #27 and #32, respectively. The list does not include Binance Coin or Bitcoin SV, which are the 8th and 9th largest coins by market cap.

Here’s a look at the complete rankings for December.

Despite strong support of blockchain technology from President Xi Jinping, China continues to draw a hard line against cryptocurrency.

The country appears to be stepping up its enterprise support for blockchain while also rebooting a strict ban on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, which initially began in September of 2017.

Late last month, China’s central bank released a statement outlining the government’s strong stance against crypto.

Primitive Ventures partner Dovey Wan highlighted a few key points from the release.

“1. ICO, IFO, IEO, STO are all unauthorized illegal public offering and securities issuance, and potentially illegal fund-raising, financial fraud, pyramid schemes and other illegal crimes.

2. Shanghai law enforcement agency will conduct ‘Special rectification of cryptocurrency-related trading platform, which can be registered overseas, shall be immediately rectified and retired’.

3. They will further regulate trading platform whose servers are outside mainland but providing virtual currency trading services to domestic residents, and will continue to strengthen the clean-up [of] the fiat payment and settlement channels and gateways.

4. Investors should be careful not to mix blockchain technology with cryptocurrency, and there are multiple risks in cryptocurrency financing, issuance and trading (again, Blockchain not crypto).”

China is now releasing its crypto rankings every two months and plans to drop its next one in February.

From Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory to Ripple’s push to bring blockchain to academia, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin

A crypto analyst known in the industry as The Cryptomist says Bitcoin may be poised for a big breakout.

In a series of tweets to her 43,000 followers, the analyst says BTC appears to be in an ascending triangle and could breakout in a matter of days.

“A possible ascending triangle to look out for Like I have been saying for the past week and a bit. I am favoring longs right now, (however, possibility of one more move down for bears)…

Targets from last week remain the same:

– 7700

– 8450

– 9400

Not long now.”

Meanwhile, a fellow analyst who goes by the name Magic is far more bearish.

Although the analyst agrees that BTC may move to the upside in the short term, Magic tells his crew of 31,000 followers that the leading cryptocurrency will remain locked in a retracement for the foreseeable future.

“BTC and the others may try for an upside breakout in the coming days. However, if BTC puts in yet another lower high, it will likely breakdown below the recently contested critical support at 7250.

We may see a short term reversal, but BTC remains in a bear market downtrend.”

Ripple and XRP

The University of Texas at Austin says it’s looking to hand out grants to faculty members and graduate students who want to launch research projects centered on blockchain and cryptocurrency.

The program is backed by Ripple, which partnered with the university in November of last year to accelerate the understanding of blockchain in academia.

“The funding is made available through a generous gift made by Ripple Labs Inc.

Students and faculty members receiving funding from the initiative shall hold the title of ‘Ripple Graduate Fellow’ and ‘Ripple Fellow,’ respectively, during the funding period, and acknowledge the grant from the Blockchain Initiative at Texas McCombs in their research papers.”

Litecoin

Litecoin creator Charlie Lee says there are multiple reasons why LTC is a necessary and important crypto asset.

In a new interview on the Let’s Talk Bitcoin podcast, Lee spotlights the coin’s biggest strengths and its overall liquidity.

“So with shorter blocktimes and cheaper fees [than Bitcoin], it’s quite good for payments and people use it quite a bit. And it’s also good for testing new stuff. Litecoin’s market cap is a lot smaller than Bitcoin’s. So we can take a little bit more risk and do stuff that potentially Bitcoin would be too conservative to do…

These network protocols, currencies – they have a network effect. So if everyone’s using it, you want to be using the one with the most liquidity, the one that’s on all the exchanges that you can easily switch back between fiat and cryptocurrency. So Litecoin benefits from that because, for example, the Chinese exchanges all added Litecoin as a second cryptocurrency.

And Litecoin now is on pretty much every single exchange. So it’s very easy for anyone, anywhere to move their money to Litecoin and obviously Bitcoin. So that helps a lot for onboarding new users. And that definitely has a network effect. Once you’re supported by all the exchanges – for example, two-thirds of the Bitcoin ATMs support Litecoin because it’s easy to implement and it’s supported everywhere.”

And, in a new development, they’re beginning to look to financial derivatives to hedge against the wild swings in their electricity needs that can turn profits to dust.

The growth of a market for such tools could accelerate investment in cryptocurrency mining, originally the preserve of lone enthusiasts but now a capital-intensive industry that is expected to see growing demand for digital coins.

Crypto miners must draw on increasingly large amounts of computing power as they compete against others to solve the complex mathematical equations to build the blockchain and earn rewards in the form of new digital coins.

Startups have largely been defenseless against changes in so-called “hashrate” - in short, a fluctuating measure of the processing power of the entire bitcoin network that dictates how much power miners need to produce new coins.

A spike in hashrate means more electricity is required, ramping up production costs and eating into eventual profits of coins sold. This wildcard could become a major obstacle for startups to attract much-needed investment from institutions and markets.

The answer, seven cryptocurrency miners and industry players told Reuters, are derivatives that allow miners to hedge the hashrate. In theory, that would give clearer projections of cashflow - a prerequisite for would-be investors.

The miners and crypto traders, spread from the United States and Canada to Britain and Hong Kong, said a market for such products, though in a very early form, was emerging and would grow in importance.

“The trend in hashrate is upwards. Unless miners increase production, they will get fewer bitcoin with the same power,” said Michel Rauchs, author of a Cambridge university study on cryptocurrency miners.

“With hashrate derivatives, they can price in risk.”

London-based DAG Global, which pitches itself as a cryptocurrency merchant bank, said miners were showing strong interest in the firm’s products for hedging hashrates.

“As the hashrate changes, you can go from being profitable to losing money very quickly,” said Robert Andersen, who leads DAG’s digital asset sales. “The contract insures you against that. It’s like insurance, and for that you pay a premium.”

Another firm, crypto trader GSR, said it has been working on similar products but, given the early stage of the market, was not yet ready to offer them.

“We’re building products around hashrate and difficulty,” said co-founder Richard Rosenblum.

“It’s going to take more than a few months for there to be significant liquidity,” he said, cautioning that a market could take a few years to develop.

And for sure, the market is at a very early stage. Firm figures are hard to come by, but some crypto players say it likely totals around $50-$100 million dollars a year.

WINNING OVER INVESTORS

For traditional investors, hunting high-yielding returns in an era of ultra-low interest rates, crypto miners could offer a tempting proposition.

With bitcoin trading at around $7,500, the 1,800 bitcoin that can be produced on any given day equates to an annual market of around $5 billion a year.

And many investors want a slice.

In an major example of a crypto mining company going public, last month Chinese giant Canaan launched a $90 million initial public offering on the Nasdaq, valuing the firm at around $2 billion.

While this is an indication of capital market appetite, Canaan is one of only a handful of giant, global crypto miners. Many others are smaller outfits that would likely have to work harder to convince investors they can manage their risks.

Still, said Marco Krohn, co-founder of Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining, which produces bitcoin from Iceland to Kazakhstan, hundreds of millions of investment dollars could be up for grabs.

“You need to leverage the traditional financial markets - and these people ask questions. They tend to be risk averse.”

To attract such investors, mining firms told Reuters they are looking more closely at controlling their risks - both on hashrates and prices - via financial tools.

“The adoption of derivatives in the mining community has definitely increased in recent months,” said Kevin Shao, a manager at Canaan’s blockchain unit, speaking through an interpreter.

It may be early days for crypto mining hedging tools, but changes are definitely afoot, said U.S. firm BitOoda, which has since April brokered a product known as a “difficulty swap”.

Sam Doctor, the company’s chief strategist, said the market for such products was growing more liquid, with the length of contracts also on the rise.

“There are more players on the sidelines watching how these trades perform before they take the step of trading themselves.”","Bitcoin mining colossus Bitmain has rejiggered its sales strategy to reverse a decline in market share following the return of co-founder Jihan Wu to the company’s helm.

At a customer event hosted by Bitmain on Saturday in Chengdu, China, Wu appeared on stage for the first time as the sole chairman and CEO a month after regaining control. Addressing clients and partners, he presented new strategies to restore Bitmain’s waning market dominance.

In essence, he proposed to sway miners to stick with Bitmain’s products by having the company take on the risks related to cash flow, bitcoin price volatility and electricity costs.

As such, Bitmain is betting big that bitcoin’s price will jump next year amid the scheduled halving of mining rewards, which will reduce new supply created with each block of transactions. Whether the next halving will actually spark a rally like the first two did is a subject of debate currently.

While the event was exclusive for customers, screenshots of the firm’s presentation deck seen and verified by CoinDesk show that Bitmain has rolled out three main tactics to appeal to mining investors.

To begin with, it appears Bitmain has replaced its previous sales strategy, wherein customers had to pay the full amount upfront for mining equipment due for future shipment, with a tiered down payment structure.

For instance, customers that pre-order 100 to 999 miners can put 50 percent down while larger investors purchasing more than 5,000 units can pay a minimum 20 percent upfront.

The rest of the payments need to be cleared seven days prior to the actual shipment date. But the upshot is this would shift the short-term cash flow pressure away from customers toward Bitmain itself.

Co-mining

A second tactic that Bitmain plans to roll out targets those who own mining farms with power resources but do not yet have enough equipment to run at full capacity.

The firm said it will offer a co-mining agreement that runs over a year for mining farm operators to rent its flagship AntMiner S17 or T17 products. Bitmain would cover the year-round electricity cost at 0.35 yuan ($0.05) per kilowatt-hour while mining farm operators remain responsible for maintenance.

In return, Bitmain will retain 75 percent of the mining profits and farm operators will take the remaining 25 percent. Notably, if the mining revenue is less than the electricity cost, all the mined coins would go to Bitmain, the presentation deck shows.

Through this plan, Bitmain could once again increase its capacity in mining for itself – an investment that has decreased over the past two years as the company focused more on selling equipment.

CoinDesk reported earlier this year that Bitmain decreased its self-owned bitcoin hash power to just 237 peta hashes per second (PH/s) in May – an 88 percent drop from April – accounting for around 0.5 percent of the network’s total power.

Yet based on the company’s latest disclosure, its proprietary mining power has rebounded over the past six months to 930 PH/s as of Dec. 5, taking about one percent of the network’s total hash rate.

Further, Bitmain now seeks to ease mining investors’ concerns regarding bitcoin’s price volatility by giving out a put option to those who make product orders in large quantities.

For example, for users who purchase 1,000 units of AntMiner S17 Pro, worth about $1.5 million, the firm will give away 62 put options, worth in total one percent of the miner order amount. Each put option would allow customers to sell bitcoin at a price of 35,000 yuan ($5,000) on March 27.

If bitcoin’s price hovers higher than $5,000 by that date, it would be a losing proposition to exercise the option. If it’s below the threshold, customers could exercise the option to make a profit, the size of which depends on how much lower bitcoin’s price would be below $5,000 at that time. Bitmain would be the counter-party bearing the cost.

Heated competition

It remains to be seen whether Bitmain’s new strategies will succeed. But the shift is a sign of intensifying competition in the mining business.

In a recent all-hands meeting, Wu admitted to his staff that Bitmain’s market dominance in mining equipment and mining pool hash rate have been declining throughout the year.

And it was for that reason that he chose to return to the management of the firm by making a surprising move that ousted his co-founder Micree Zhan as chairman.

Meanwhile, competition among major miner makers in China is still racing nonstop ahead of bitcoin’s halving next year with Shenzhen-based WhatsMiner manufacturer MicroBT launching its flagship M30 series of miners.

Also on Saturday, MicroBT released the new line of products. They boast a hashing power of 88 tera hashes per second with energy consumption as low as 38 joules per terahash.","A new bitcoin futures fund managed by the $15 billion asset manager Stone Ridge has been approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While firms like Galaxy Digital and VanEck have recently rolled out similarly structured funds, the new fund intends to invest only in cash-settled futures, which addresses regulatory concerns regarding potential market manipulation and has won it a personal endorsement from SEC official Dalia Blass.

Stone Ridge Trust VI filed the registration statement for the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund in October. After two subsequent amendments, the registration went into effect on Monday. According to an NYDIG spokesperson, the fund is the first to be approved by the SEC.

Stone Ridge Funds, a subsidiary of Stone Ridge Holdings Group targeted at institutional clients with long-term horizons, will act as the new fund’s investment advisor, according to the filings. By Aug. 30, the group has managed approximately $15 billion worth of assets.

The new fund is “a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company,” the filings say. Its shares are not listed on any exchange and only institutional traders can invest at a price of $10 per share. Shareholders may not sell or repurchase their shares on a daily basis but can only periodically sell portions of their shares back to the fund. This feature is designed to only draw in long-term investors with sustainable investment goals and relatively high-risk tolerance. Furthermore, the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund will not directly invest in digital assets like Bitcoin, the filings claim but will focus on investing in bitcoin futures contracts.

""Prime example""

The new fund came as a result of the SEC’s recent effort to engage the fund industry in conversations about investor protection, according to last week’s speech by Director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, Dalia Blass.

In her speech, Blass gave the agency’s rationale for supporting the fund. Firstly, the fund will only invest in cash-settled futures, which will mitigate the risks and challenges involved in direct holdings of digital assets. Secondly, since the fund is a closed-end interval fund that does not offer daily redemptions, it will not suffer from large, short-term liquidity demands by market makers and its price will remain relatively stable. Moreover, the fund has taken measures to prevent potential manipulation, including offering substantive risk disclosures, recruiting only registered investment advisers, and setting an initial cap of $25 million to limit the fund's size and growth trajectory. At the same time, however, she emphasized that “no investment products are absolutely risk-free,” which she said is particularly true when it comes to newly emergent investment strategies like those seen in the digital asset market.

Blass considers the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund a “prime example” of the SEC’s recent engagement efforts and claimed that the agency “welcome[s] and value[s] constructive industry engagement regarding new products and novel investment strategies.” SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce echoed Blass’s restrained optimism and tweeted that the launch of the new fund shows “a bit of progress” in this regard.","Barely three months after launching its long-anticipated physically settled bitcoin futures product, the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt has gone live with its bitcoin options and cash-settled futures contracts.

The New York Stock Exchange’s sister firm announced in a blog post Monday that it’s using its physically settled bitcoin contracts as a benchmark to support the new products, which were both announced in recent weeks.

The blog post compared Intercontinental Exchange’s bitcoin ambitions to those of its Brent Crude Oil Futures. The company launched a number of swaps, options and futures contracts based on the crude oil product, and hopes to follow “a similar playbook” to grow its bitcoin-related products.

“By starting with the physically delivered Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Monthly Futures, we have a benchmark contract which provides the foundation for us to develop complementary products based on the needs of our customers,” the blog post said.

While Bakkt’s physical futures contract saw a slow start after it was launched in late September, volume has recently picked up, with the monthly futures product trading more than $120 million three months in.

Bakkt’s options contract comes just a month before CME, which already offers cash-settled bitcoin futures in the U.S., launches its own similar product. However, while Bakkt’s pricing will be based around its existing physical product, CME’s is dependent on its bitcoin index.

Malta-based OKEx also announced Monday that it would offer options trading later this month.

Bakkt’s monthly options contract has no exposure to spot markets, the firm said.

The cash futures, offered through ICE Futures Singapore, seemingly takes aim at potential demand in Asian markets, though any ICE customer can trade the contract.

The blog post also included a signup link for individuals interested in being updated on Bakkt’s consumer app, with the link itself asking those signing up to specify whether they are a consumer or a merchant.

Bakkt announced the app in October, saying it would help consumers pay for goods using bitcoin. Starbucks will be a launch partner when the app goes live sometime next year.

“At Bakkt, our mission is to bring trust and utility to digital assets,” the blog post says. “These new contracts represent an important milestone in the development of this emerging asset class and our bitcoin product complex.”"
2019-12-10,"Three men, including one from Camarillo, have been arrested in connection with an alleged cryptocurrency mining scheme that authorities say defrauded investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars from April 2014 through December 2019. The Department of Justice announced charges Tuesday.

Matthew Brent Goettsche, 37, of Lafayette, Colo.; Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks, 38, of Arvada, Colo.; and Joseph Frank Abel, 49, of Camarillo, were indicted on charges of conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities. Goettsche and Weeks were also charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

U.S. Atty. Craig Carpenito described the alleged fraud as a “modern, high-tech Ponzi scheme” that amounted to $722 million. Two other suspects remain at large.

“Those arrested today are accused of deploying elaborate tactics to lure thousands of victims with promises of large returns on their investments in a bitcoin mining pool, an advanced method of profiting on cryptocurrency,” said Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “The defendants allegedly made hundreds of millions of dollars by continuing to recruit new investors over several years while spending victims’ money lavishly.”

The defendants operated BitClub Network, providing false and misleading figures that investors were told were “bitcoin mining earnings” in exchange for money, Carpenito said.

According to court documents, officials said that Goettsche referred to investors as “dumb” and said he was “building this whole model on the backs of idiots.” On at least three occasions, the illegality of the alleged scheme was referenced to Goettsche. Additionally, he, Weeks, Abel, and others conspired to sell BitClub Network shares when they were unregistered securities, authorities said.

The maximum penalty for wire fraud conspiracy is 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Conspiracy to sell unregistered securities carrie a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine up to $250,000.","LOS ANGELES — Five men were charged Tuesday in connection with what federal prosecutors called a lucrative cryptocurrency scheme that fleeced investors out of $722 million in a business model that one of the defendants described as built ""on the backs of idiots,"" according to court documents.

The 27-page indictment, unsealed in U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, names Matthew Brent Goettsche, 37, of Lafayette, Colorado; Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks, 38, of Arvada, Colorado; and Silviu Balaci, whose age and residence were not immediately known, as part of a conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They were also charged with conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities.

""What they allegedly did amounts to little more than a modern, high-tech Ponzi scheme that defrauded victims of hundreds of millions of dollars,"" U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said.

Prosecutors allege that BitClub Network, which operated from April 2014 to this month, was built on soliciting money from individuals in exchange for shares of purported cryptocurrency mining pools and on rewarding investors for bringing in new clients. The group did not register shares sold with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the indictment alleges.

To bolster their business, Goettsche, Weeks and others conspired to solicit investments by providing false and misleading figures described as ""bitcoin mining earnings,"" prosecutors alleges. Weeks and a fourth man, Joseph Frank Abel, 49, of Camarillo, California, created videos and traveled around the country and the world to promote BitClub Network, describing their firm as ""the most transparent company in the history of the world that I've ever seen"" and ""too big to fail,"" according to prosecutors.

But behind the scenes, they appeared to combine greed, contempt for their investors and, at times, doubt about sustaining the scheme, according to prosecutors.

In February 2015, Goettsche directed Balaci to ""bump up the daily mining earnings starting today by 60%,"" according to the indictment, to which Balaci is alleged to have warned ""that is not sustainable, that is ponzi teritori [sic] and fast cash-out ponzi ... but sure.""

Balaci told Goettsche not long after launching the company that their target audience would be ""the typical dumb MLM (multi-level marketing) investor,"" according to the court filing. Months later, the complaint alleges, Goettsche told Balaci that ""we are building this whole model on the backs of idiots"" and that to ""prove the mining ... just means convincing the morons Q.""

In September 2017, Goettsche sent an email to another alleged conspirator, suggesting that BitClub Network ""[d]rop mining earnings significantly starting now"" so he could ""retire RAF!!! (rich as f---),"" according to the indictment.

But court documents indicate that cracks were showing. Weeks remarked in an email to Goettsche and another accused conspirator in June 2017 that BitClub's selling shares and not using the money to buy mining equipment was ""not right.""

Four of the men were scheduled to make court appearances Tuesday. Authorities also are seeking a fifth man, whose identity was redacted pending his arrest.

If convicted, the defendants face maximum penalties of 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 on the fraud conspiracy count. The charge of conspiracy to sell unregistered securities carries a maximum sentence of five years with a $250,000 fine.",How much Bitcoin comes from dirty coal? A flooded mine in China just spotlighted the issue,"French asset management firm Napoleon AM has launched a new fund tied to Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) cash-settled bitcoin futures.

The “Napoleon Bitcoin Fund” began trading on Dec. 6 with a minimum €100,000 ($110,000) buy-in for professional investors, who must reside in France, according to the prospectus. It can not be traded cross-border.

It is the first bitcoin fund released by Napoleon AM, the asset management wing of French financial services firm Napoleon Group. Napoleon AM became a licensed “Alternative Investment Fund Manager” in May 2019, the French financial regulator’s website shows.

And it’s also one of the first French funds to make novel use of CME’s cash-settled Bitcoin futures. The fund seeks exposure to bitcoin price movements without holding any actual bitcoin, according to the prospectus.

To that end, it trades CME bitcoin futures, the United States’ only regulated cash-settled bitcoin futures products (CME competitor Bakkt launched its own cash-settled bitcoin futures product in Singapore on Monday).

Napoleon could conceivably tap into Bakkt’s new product; the prospectus and investor factsheet leave open the possibility of including “similar[ly] organized exchange listing cash-settled BTC futures” going forward.

“We have opened the door for alternative use of futures in order to optimize replication and maintain access to the best sources in the future,” said Napoleon AM’s Communications Director Sergio Gonzalez.

Stéphane Ifrah, President of Napoleon AM, said in a press statement that the fund “is the culmination of discussions with the [French] regulator.”

“We are proud to contribute to the institutionalization and democratization of digital assets through a unique regulated fund under French law.”

It remains to be seen how popular an investment vehicle tied to bitcoin futures will be with French investors.","China Releases Year-End Crypto Rankings

China’s Center for Information and Industry Development has published its year-end crypto project rankings. Thirty-five projects were evaluated and ranked overall as well as in three separate categories. Bitcoin has risen in ranking while EOS remains China’s favorite.

Year-End Crypto Rankings

The Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID), under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, released the 15th update of its crypto project rankings on Friday. While the hype for blockchain technology initiated by President Xi Jinping has somewhat subsided, the center continues its work on evaluating and ranking crypto projects. This month’s release is the last one this year. The center evaluated the same 35 projects in December as it did for the previous rankings in September.

In addition to the overall ranking, the CCID evaluated all the projects based on their basic technology, applicability, and creativity. EOS remains at the top of the overall ranking, followed by Ethereum and then Tron. The center started ranking Tron in February, debuting it at number two overall. However, in July, it dropped to the third place and Ethereum regained its number two ranking. In September, Tron overtook Ethereum once again but only to fall to the third place once more this month. NULS ranks fourth, followed by Lisk, Neo, Steem, and Bitshares. BTC has risen from the 11th spot to the 9th spot. BCH also improved, rising from the 30th spot to the 27th spot.

The CCID describes itself as “a first-class scientific research institution directly under the administration of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China.” It provides professional services to the government including research, consulting, evaluation, certification, and research and development, according to its website. The center has been working on its Global Public Blockchain Technology Assessment Index since the beginning of last year. The rankings are compiled by CCID (Qingdao) Blockchain Research Institute, an entity established by the CCID, in collaboration with other organizations such as the CCID Think Tank and the China Software Evaluation Center. “The result of this assessment will allow the CCID group to provide better technical consulting services for government agencies, business enterprises, research institutes, and technology developers,” the CCID previously explained.

This Month’s Sub-Rankings

The CCID explained that the basic technology sub-category mainly evaluates the technical implementation of the public chain, primarily examining its functions, performance, security, and decentralization. This month, EOS and Tron still occupy the first and second places, the center noted, adding that “The average value of the basic technology sub-index has not changed much from the previous period.”

The applicability sub-index mainly evaluates the comprehensive level of the applications that the public chain actually supports, including node deployment, wallet applications, development support, and application implementation. In this evaluation period, the center revealed that “The average value of the overall applicability index increased significantly from the previous period.” The creativity sub-index mainly examines the continuous innovation of the public chain, including the number of developers, code updates and code impact. The center noted that compared to the previous period, the average creativity sub-index has only increased slightly.

David Low, general manager of South East Asia at Luno, told local news outlet The Malaysian Reserve on Monday that the exchange will add XRP later this month or early next year. Luno Malaysia currently offers trading in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).

The exchange’s plan of adding XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by Ripple, been approved by the Securities Commission Malaysia, per the report. “Ripple also has a remittance use case which we are excited about. That’s why we want to introduce it to Malaysians, as it allows people on the platform to access and learn about it, and figure out new ways to use this technology for their benefits,” said Low.

Luno was relaunched in Malaysia last month after receiving approval from the securities regulator. “We are planning to increase our cryptocurrency offerings as we grow, while keeping customer’s safety and compliance with regulations as our highest priority,” Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia at Luno, was quoted as saying in the report.

Luno is backed by notable investors, including Naspers Ventures, and has raised $13.8 million in total funding to date, according to Crunchbase. It also operates across Africa and Europe. Last month, Luno also announced to relaunch its services in Singapore as banks opened its accounts - while it will help Luno to pay salaries and hold money raised from investors, it won’t yet allow the firm to hold money for clients.","Denmark-based cryptocurrency users have begun receiving letters from the Danish tax agency, Skattestyrelsen, requesting that traders provide a full background of all their cryptocurrency transactions, sources informed Cointelegraph on Dec. 10.

In its letters, Skattestyrelsen specifically asked crypto users to provide information about profits and losses for fiscal years 2016 to 2018, according to FIFO (First In First Out) principles. These principles represent a method of inventory valuation assuming that all goods are sold or used in the same chronological order in which consumers purchased them.

Furthermore, the tax agency asked for the rates used for each transaction, information on the purpose of acquiring digital currencies, and documentation regarding the creation of a cryptocurrency wallet.

Disclosure of crypto exchange services used

In terms of crypto exchange services, Skattestyrelsen requested that crypto consumers revealed the confirmation of their trading activity in the form of a screenshot featuring the individual’s name and an agreement on the creation of an account.

In addition to that, Skattestyrelsen wants to examine crypto consumers’ account statements from their bank accounts for the aforementioned period. Robin Singh, founder of cryptocurrency tax startup Koinly, provided Cointelegraph with the letter. Singh commented:

“Many of our Danish users have received these letters, Skat is asking for a full breakdown of all their transactions and asking them to fix all past reports as well. Filing tax on cryptocurrency trades is a difficult task as crypto traders usually hold several exchange accounts & wallets and freely transfer crypto between them, so there’s no easy way to figure out what the capital gains are for any particular trade.”

Skattestyrelsen’s first steps towards crypto user taxation

Skattestyrelsen turned its focus to crypto consumers late last year when it confirmed that it was “identifying” 2,700 individuals it said owed taxes on Bitcoin (BTC) gains. The agency intended to go after each individual with an eye to determining their payment obligations. Skattestyrelsen said at the time:

“If something does not match, we will contact them and ask for more information. However, how many people it is and what it may mean, it is still too early to say.”

In January 2019, the country’s Tax Council authorized Skattestyrelsen to obtain information on all trades of cryptocurrencies across three domestic crypto exchanges. At the time, the tax agency planned to make the first adjustments to tax treatment for specific cases based on the newly-acquired information before summer 2019.

In August, the agency received authorization to obtain information regarding cryptocurrency trading from 20,000 private individuals.

Following the U.S. IRS practice

Skattestyrelsen thus follows the United States Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) example. The IRS sent letters to 10,000 crypto investors to clarify crypto tax filing requirements and, in certain cases, compel them to pay back taxes. At the time, the IRS said that it asked some of the crypto investors to amend their tax filings, while compelling others to pay back taxes and/or interest and penalties.

In October, the IRS added a question on crypto ownership to the standard 1040 income tax form for the coming tax season. IRS specifically asked: “At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?” The question expects a straightforward yes or no, with no additional details requested.","This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world.

Why hasn’t cryptocurrency gone mainstream?

“It doesn’t scale.”

“It’s slow.”

“It’s expensive.”

“It’s volatile.”

“It’s hard to use.”

Or maybe it was never supposed to go mainstream.

This is not to say cryptocurrency is any less important, meaningful, or useful. Rather, I think perhaps we have been judging cryptocurrencies’ success (or lack thereof) according to a false metric. We would not judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.

By design, cryptocurrency does not solve mainstream problems.

Scale, speed, and cost are all examples of mainstream problems within finance, from main street to Wall Street. Credit card networks go down. Stock trades take days to clear. Wire transfers are expensive. In some situations, cryptocurrencies may offer marginal improvements on any of these issues, but more often blockchain-based systems will fail when compared to more conventional, centralized solutions.

This does not represent a design flaw. In fact, this is an intentional trade off. Decentralized systems forsake scale, speed, and cost in favor of one key feature: censorship resistance. Cryptocurrency solves problems faced by the censored who, by definition, are not the mainstream.

In particular, cryptocurrency enables individuals and organizations to make censored transactions. Procuring drugs on the internet. That’s an example of a censored transaction. Buying US dollars in Argentina is another example. Paying a sex worker. Sending money to a friend in Iran. Making an online purchase as an unbanked individual. Selling cannabis as a dispensary. Getting money out of Venezuela. Supporting dissidents in Hong Kong. The primary utility of cryptocurrency lies in engaging in financial activity that is otherwise suppressed or prohibited.

This is the stated intent of cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, described cryptocurrency as a tool of freedom. He compared it to other peer to peer networks like Tor which are similarly resilient to censorship. If we look at the anecdotal evidence, we can see that this is indeed how bitcoin is being used from China to Palestine. Furthermore, what little quantitative data we have also suggests that cryptocurrency use is higher in countries with financial restrictions. These results line up with predictions around cryptocurrency adoption that have existed for years. It is time to face this potentially uncomfortable reality: cryptocurrency is most useful when breaking laws and social constructs.

I, for one, do not want to live in a world where cryptocurrency has found mainstream use.

There exists a long history of censorship resistant and privacy preserving technologies: Signal for messaging, Bittorrent for file-sharing, Tor for web browsing. Like bitcoin, these tools are not built for the mainstream. Most people would rather use faster, slicker, glossier centralized alternatives like Facebook Message, Dropbox, and Google Chrome. But for censored people and organizations, decentralized technologies have always provided an escape hatch. For as long as they have existed, these tools have brought with them a certain level of societal discomfort. This discomfort stems not from these platforms being lawless domains — regulations exist on the dark web as much as they do in any jurisdiction – but rather from the difficulty these platforms present in enforcing these government policies and social norms. These technologies render censored activities more difficult to stop.

Decentralized technologies can be used for good, for evil, and for everything in between. From Hammurabi’s Code through to the Patriot Act, the morality of laws has been a matter of debate for as long as they have existed. The laws of one jurisdiction are often deemed unethical and unacceptable by its citizens and those of other geographies. To say that cryptocurrency is used primarily to engage in illegal or socially unacceptable activities is not a normative statement. It is used by freedom fighters and terrorists, by journalists and dissidents, by scammers and black market dealers, by revolutionaries and government officials. It is used by civilians to break unjust laws and escape humanitarian crisis, and it is used by the policymakers who write those very same laws. And of course, the same statements can all be made regarding the original decentralized payment system: cash.

As an industry, we spend a lot of time considering how to drive mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. I, for one, do not want to live in a world where cryptocurrency has found mainstream use. For if it has, that world is a very scary place indeed.

This is not to discourage or devalue any of the work that is being done to improve decentralized technologies. Many projects in the industry are working toward optimizing away shortcomings in the technology. Layer 2 protocols promise to speed things up. New consensus mechanisms and forms of sybil resistance expect to improve scalability and reduce infrastructure costs. A myriad of applications are building more user-friendly wallets, on-ramps, exchanges, and other tools. All of these developments are important but they may never result in mass adoption. Improvements in scalability, speed, cost, volatility, and user experience may, however, make the critical difference for those who are users, no matter how fringe: the young woman in Venezuela surviving on bitcoin or the Chinese businessman using Tether for cross-border trade.",
2019-12-11,"Three people were arrested -- and two more remain at large -- for involvement in an alleged ""high-tech Ponzi scheme"" that defrauded $722 million out of investors using the ""complex world of cryptocurrency,"" according to federal authorities.

The alleged scheme includes a trail of evidence indicating they were targeting ""dumb"" investors and ""building this whole model on the backs of idiots,"" investigators added.

""The indictment describes the defendants’ use of the complex world of cryptocurrency to take advantage of unsuspecting investors,"" U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said in a Department of Justice statement on Tuesday announcing the arrests.

""What they allegedly did amounts to little more than a modern, high-tech Ponzi scheme that defrauded victims of hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Carpentino added. ""Working with our law enforcement partners here and across the country, we will ensure that these scammers are held to account for their crimes.""

Matthew Brent Goettsche, 37, and Jobadiah Sinclair Week, 38, of Colorado, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities. Joseph Franks Abel, 49, of California, also arrested as part of the alleged scheme, was charged with conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities.

Two other defendants remain at large, authorities said. Their identities are under seal and were not released.

The men allegedly lived ""lavishly"" while running the scheme, which began more than five years ago.

The three men arrested ""are accused of deploying elaborate tactics to lure thousands of victims with promises of large returns on their investments in a bitcoin mining pool, an advanced method of profiting on cryptocurrency,"" Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, said in a statement.

""The defendants allegedly made hundreds of millions of dollars by continuing to recruit new investors over several years while spending victims' money lavishly,"" Delacourt added.

John R. Tafur, the special agent in charge at the IRS Criminal Investigation's Newark Field Office described their alleged scheme as a ""classic con game with a virtual twist.""

From April 2014 until this month, the men allegedly ran BitClub Network, which rewarded investors for recruiting new investors and brought in money from them in exchange for shares in the apparent crypto mining pools.

Goettsche told the others to target ""dumb"" investors, who he referred to as ""sheep,"" authorities said. At one point, he said he was ""building this whole model on the backs of idiots,"" according the DOJ.

In a particularly damning exchange in February 2015, Goettsche told a colleague to ""bump up the daily mining earnings starting today by 60%."" His colleague said back: ""that is not sustainable, that is ponzi teritori [sic] and fast cash-out ponzi ... but sure,"" authorities said.

Abel and Weeks promoted BitClub Network to investors around the country, law enforcement said. In one promotional video, Abel told investors that BitClub Network was ""too big to fail.""

In September 2017, Goettsche directed a colleague at BitClub Network to ""[d]rop mining earnings significantly starting now,"" so that he could ""retire RAF!!! (rich as f***).""

The men were arrested across the country: Goettsche in Colorado, Weeks in Florida and Abel in California. Their initial court appearances are scheduled in the districts of their arrests, according to authorities.

It is not immediately clear if the three arrested have obtained attorneys. Attempts by ABC News to reach them on Wednesday were unsuccessful.

The DOJ is encouraging victims of the BitClub Network scheme to come forward at a designated website.","A Colorado man with Cedar Rapids ties who has made news locally for his family's jet-setting lifestyle was charged this week in connection with what federal authorities call a $722 million bitcoin fraud - akin to a high-tech Ponzi scheme.

Identified as Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks, 38, of Arvada, Colo., in court documents, he is among four people named as defendants - with a fifth at large and unidentified - in the alleged ruse involving digital currency.

Weeks 'promoted” BitClub Network, which was at the center of the scheme, according to charging documents.

The defendants deployed 'elaborate tactics” to lure 'thousands of victims with promises of large returns on their investments in a bitcoin mining pool, an advanced method of profiting on cryptocurrency,” said a news release from Craig Carpenito, U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.

'The indictment describes the defendants' use of the complex world of cryptocurrency to take advantage of unsuspecting investors,” Carpenito said in a statement. 'What they allegedly did amounts to little more than a modern, high-tech Ponzi scheme that defrauded victims of hundreds of millions of dollars. Working with our law enforcement partners here and across the country, we will ensure that these scammers are held to account for their crimes.”

The Gazette has reported twice on the Weeks family's almost too-good-to-be-true globe-trotting adventures in the past year. In the stories, he was identified as 'Joby” Weeks - short for Jobadiah.

The story has been told through the lens of Liberty Weeks, the 1-year-old daughter of Joby and wife Stephanie Weeks, a Cedar Rapids native who grew up here and attended Jefferson High. They periodically return to visit family.

Messages to Joby and Stephanie Weeks were not returned.

At 42 days old, Liberty became the youngest to visit all 50 states, and by 13 months had already visited 45 countries, her family said and documented through photos, videos and social media.

Joby Weeks had ties to former Libertarian and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, who was on hand for the delivery of Liberty, and rubbed shoulders with other celebrities.

The lifestyle was supported by Joby Weeks' early investment in bitcoin, he had told The Gazette in 2018.

He was also an entrepreneur and had online videos and tutorials discussing bitcoin and encouraging investors.

Weeks and Matthew Brent Goettsche, 37, of Lafayette, Colo., were indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and Goettsche, Weeks, and Joseph Frank Abel, 49, of Camarillo, Calif., were indicted on charges of conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities, according to the news release. Silviu Catalin Balaci was later indicted.

According to the news release, from April 2014 through December 2019, the defendants operated BitClub Network, a fraudulent scheme that solicited money from investors in exchange for shares of purported cryptocurrency mining pools and rewarded investors for recruiting new investors. They scheme was bolstered by providing false and misleading figures that BitClub investors were told were 'bitcoin mining earnings,” according to the statement.

Goettsche, in messages obtained by federal authorities, referred to their target audience as 'dumb” investors, 'sheep,” and said he was 'building this whole model on the backs of idiots,” according to the news release.

In June 2017, Weeks emailed Goettsche and another saying, 'BitClub selling shares in BitClub and then not using the money to purchase mining equipment was ‘not right,'” according to the news release.

Weeks and the other defendants 'obtained the equivalent of at least $722 million from BitClub Network investors,” according to the news release.

Additionally, BitClub did not register its shares, which were securities, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the news release.

The wire fraud conspiracy charge carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison, and a fine of up to $250,000. The conspiracy to sell unregistered securities charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine up to $250,000, according to the attorney's office.

In 2019, it became clear that Asia was moving ahead in cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption and application. Because of internal and external drivers, Asia has been setting the pace in turning ideas in the blockchain space into reality.

Investors in China, Japan, and South Korea are being driven into crypto markets by global and regional trade wars, currency devaluation, and tight government control of individual assets. Global trading platform, eToro, has found consistent spikes in bitcoin activity during key moments of the US-China trade war.

In May, after China announced a tariff hike on $60 billion worth of American goods, and investors immediately moved to divest their wealth elsewhere. The number of new bitcoin positions soared 139% (along with a 108% rise in new gold positions). The increase in both new gold and bitcoin positions has been consistent as the trade war between both powers has continued — with bitcoin witnessing more significant benefits than the precious metal. It seems that amidst increasing uncertainty upon the global economic stage, bitcoin is reaping the benefits.

Additionally, in 2019, Chinese consumers were the greatest users of Tether—using the stablecoin to transfer their yuan across borders, free from government supervision and sanction. While the Chinese government doesn’t allow yuan trading on domestic exchanges, Tether has allowed Chinese consumers to partake in global cryptocurrency markets—with up to 99% of bitcoin spot trades conducted using Tether according to Chainalysis.

Established Markets: Where Fintech Innovation is Commonplace

Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore are established hubs for digital payments adoption and fintech innovation. In the first 9 months of this year alone, investments into Singaporean fintech companies exceeded $1 billion USD, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore stating that this was the result not only of local startup activity but also international fintech companies using Singapore is a base for global expansion.

China is perhaps the first country to be in a position to credibly claim “cashless” status. A 2017 Penguin Intelligence study has shown that 92% of inhabitants in China’s top cities use WeChat Pay or AliPay as their primary payment method. In addition to their prowess within the fintech space, the more traditional markets of Asia’s leading economies have been dubbed as the next bastion of economic growth globally, with the Financial Times predicting that by 2025 we will have entered into a new “Asian Century”. With regional fintech players dominating digital payments, one would question whether crypto can compete and find a foothold to demonstrate its use as a digital payments system.

Global instability has provided opportunities for alternative assets. The Chinese economy and the Yuan are continuing to trend downward amidst a trade war with the US. Hong Kong’s financial sector is suffering the consequences of increased political instability and security risks within the country. Hong Kong’s stock market was the world’s worst performer in Q3. Meanwhile, fraught relations between South Korea and North Korea, as well as Japan, are doing nothing to improve investor confidence in the capital markets, hurting the value of national currencies. With stability increasingly in question, traditional investors and institutions are looking at cryptocurrencies as a means to hedge their assets and diversify their portfolios, creating capital flows into the digital assets space, which has been largely insulated from the knock-on effects of regime instability and international trade conditions.

Emerging Economies: Growth Without Trust

Blockchain and cryptocurrency has a different sort of role in emerging economies, like Philippines and India, where trust in local institutions remains low and new systems and structures created in the crypto markets can bolster feeble financial infrastructures.

Crypto is offering tangible benefits within countries’ struggling to provide adequate services and solutions to consumers.

From the use of cryptocurrencies as a remittance tool—facilitating more convenient, secure, and transparent international payments than legacy payments systems—to interbank transactions, crypto-adoption is offering tangible benefits within countries’ struggling to provide adequate services and solutions to consumers. Far removed from the inefficiencies of local governments and financial apparatus, decentralized finance potentially provides a more stable, secure means of holding and transferring wealth.

2019: Regulating a Grassroots Movement

Singapore, one of the leading hubs for blockchain adoption, now boasts more than 400 fintech firms within the island nation, one for every 14,000 people living in the country. “Blockchain” is the fastest growing job skill in Singapore, and among the top 3 in China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Vietnam, according to LinkedIn studies. While BTC and ETH continue to enjoy popularity within the region, altcoins like TRON and EOS have special status in Asia. With all of this activity, the region’s regulators have been paying attention. This has resulted in much regulatory proactivity—with countries from Malaysia and Singapore to Japan and South Korea having unveiled comprehensive guidelines for the issuance and purchase of digital assets, while other regions have lagged behind. This may well signal more things to come in the year ahead.

Big companies like Facebook entered the crypto space this year, but there is still a long way for them to go in drawing large consumer-tech firms into the cryptocurrency fold. Mature businesses and institutions are unlikely to enter into the nascent crypto sector if they believe they are rolling the dice on regulatory compliance. Enticing them into the blockchain ecosystem will require clear regulation. Asia is where they may be able to find it.

The region’s regulators have become the forerunners in establishing clear “rules of the game” when it comes to digital assets, engaging closely with groups such as the Financial Action Task Force and key industry players. While the U.S. continues to grapple with the regulation of digital assets, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, and particularly within the island of Jeju, have outlined more comprehensive regulatory boundaries for actors within the blockchain industry. While China has taken a heavy-handed regulatory approach, the government has been nonetheless consistent and clear in the communication of policies surrounding the blockchain sector. This clarity leaves Asia’s regional blockchain sector well-positioned to serve as a vanguard for the development of real-world use cases of cryptocurrency technology and as a leader in consumer engagement.

2020: Cryptocurrencies Coming of Age?

In 2019, Asia became a testing bed for cryptocurrency adoption, presenting real use cases of cryptocurrencies in both highly developed and emerging markets. Pervasive economic tensions, structural instability, and downward market pressures may prove the headwinds necessary for cryptocurrency to finally enter the mainstream.","David is a tech journalist who loves old-school adventure games, techno and the Beastie Boys.

Bitcoin‘s long-term holders continue to keep their cryptocurrency close, despite its declining value — 59 percent of BTC’s circulating supply still hasn’t moved in at least one year.

Generally, these trends are in-line with shrinking Bitcoin trading volumes, reports research firm Delphi Digital.

Still, the firm highlighted 220,000 BTC (worth roughly $1.6 billion at current prices) bought way back in November 2017 — the start of peak Bitcoin-mania — that hasn’t moved at all since then. Surely, some strong hands.

The green line represents Bitcoin that hasn’t moved in at least 1 year

There’s less new money entering the cryptocurrency space

Trading activity spiked at the end of October, when Bitcoin‘s price last pushed above $9,000, but volumes had reached six-month lows by the end of November.

“Declining volume has been the trend since the high back in June, a symptom of a general decrease in new money entering the space,” said Delphi Digital analysts.

That blue line represents Bitcoin’s rolling 7-day volume.

In fact, Bitcoin’s month-over-month volume has dropped by 9.4 percent across the top cryptocurrency exchanges, with the largest decline coming from spot USD markets.

The firm again noted this means it’s possible there’s less capital entering and exiting the space.

Binance and Huobi attract most of the inflowing Bitcoin

As for where the inflowing Bitcoin goes, major exchanges Binance and Huobi persist as the industry’s dominant trading venues. Together, they account for over 50 percent of BTC deposits every month since August.

There’s more Bitcoin flowing into exchanges than out.

Analysts noted that OKEx and Huobi saw “strong increases” since the beginning of August, but highlighted that a portion of the latter’s activity was actually a byproduct of a cryptocurrency-fueled Ponzi scheme known as PlusToken.

“The worst monthly decline since the same month last year definitely added insult to injury to the crypto market’s ongoing drawdown. Fading catalysts and sentiment are partially to blame, but one of the real culprits is the lack of new buyer demand,” said Delphi Digital.

“Often times, it seems as if capital is just being reshuffled among existing player who can ignite violent market moves given the minuscule size of this market, so a renewed enthusiasm among investors is going to be required for bitcoin (and crypto at large) to reverse its downward trend,” it added.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

The broader cryptocurrency market appears vulnerable to further losses on Wednesday, as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies slipped back into negative territory for the month.

Bitcoin fell back to its lowest trading level since Dec. 4, after the BTC/USD pair broke through the $7,300 support barrier.

Binance Coin was worst performer inside the top 10 while Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin edged close to critical support.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is currently $191 billion as measured by TradingView, a loss of $11 billion since Monday.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin has started to fall back into a lower short-term trading range, following the heavy technical rejection from the $7,600 level earlier this week.

A bearish triangle breakout is currently underway on the lower time frames, leaving the BTC/USD pair vulnerable to further losses while trading under the $7,380 level.

Key upcoming technical support is located at the $7,070, $6,850 and $6,600 levels.

Total Market Capitalization

The chart of the total market capitalization is looking increasingly bearish, following the recent rejection from the $211 billion level.

The lower time frames show that a loss of $187 billion level could trigger heavy technical selling , with $180 billion as a possible target.

Sustained weakness under the $180 billion level could spark an even deeper market decline, and place the November monthly trading low back into focus.

Overall Sentiment

According to the latest data from The TIE, sentiment toward the cryptocurrency market is bullish at 63 percent.

Bitcoin SV has the strongest sentiment among the top 10 at 63 percent. Meanwhile, Binance Coin has the weakest at 35 percent.","China’s bitcoin miners now control two-thirds of the crypto network’s processing power, research showed on Wednesday. And a growing share that is likely to benefit the country’s miners.

Miners in China control 66 percent of the power of all computers around the world that are hooked up to the bitcoin network, according to a report by digital asset manager CoinShares. That power is known as the “hashrate,” and it dictates a computer’s ability to produce new coins.

The Chinese share of hashrate, up from 60 percent in June, is the highest recorded by CoinShares since it began tracking hashrate nearly two years ago. The gains may be due to China’s greater deployment of more advanced mining gear, said Chris Bendiksen, the firm’s head of research.

Chinese companies such as Bitmain and MicroBT are among the world’s biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear. Another, Canaan, launched a $90m initial public offering in November, indicating investor hunger for exposure to miners.

At bitcoin’s current price of around $7,200, miners produce bitcoin worth around $4.7bn every year.

“This is beneficial to the Chinese mining industry,” said Bendiksen. “If you are the first to increase your proportion of the hashrate, and you can do that before your competitors, that’s generally good.”

Crypto-mining is a highly opaque sector, with little reliable data on the bitcoin network or bitcoin miners.

Bitcoin miners draw on huge amounts of computing power as they battle against others to solve complex mathematical equations to earn new coins. The higher the hashrate, the more power is needed to produce bitcoin.

And mining has become more difficult. The network’s hashrate has risen 80 percent since June, in part because of the strong profitability of miners and more powerful machines, said London-based CoinShares, which manages around $600m in digital assets.

China has cracked down on crypto-exchanges and fundraising in recent years, even as it develops its own digital currency.

After looking at banning crypto-mining, Beijing last month indicated it would not do so. Some analysts interpreted the move as indicating tolerance of the sector.

The most significant crypto mining hubs are in China’s Yunnan, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Sichuan provinces, CoinShares said, with the latter accounting for over half the global hashrate. Other centres are spread from the United States to Russia and Kazakhstan.

China’s share of hashrate may fall as more Chinese-made next-generation gear makes its way into other markets, CoinShares said.","Denmark's Tax Authority Sends Warning Letters to 20,000 Crypto Owners

The tax authority of Denmark has reportedly sent out warning letters to 20,000 crypto owners asking them to amend their tax returns, pay taxes on crypto gains, or face penalties. The tax agency is demanding a full breakdown of their crypto transactions; it recently obtained information on these traders from three local crypto exchanges.

Warning Letters to Crypto Investors

Danish Skattestyrelsen, the tax authority of Denmark, has reportedly sent out warning letters to 20,000 cryptocurrency owners. Swedish crypto tax startup Koinly posted a copy of the letter on its website on Monday. The company detailed:

In the last 2 weeks, the agency began sending out warning letters to these investors urging them to amend their tax reports by the 15th of December or face penalties.

“Many of our Danish users have received these letters, Skat is asking for a full breakdown of all their transactions and asking them to fix all past reports as well,” said CEO Robin Singh who founded Koinly last year. “Filing tax on cryptocurrency trades is a difficult task as crypto traders usually hold several exchange accounts and wallets and freely transfer crypto between them, so there’s no easy way to figure out what the capital gains are for any particular trade.” The company claims to have helped thousands of crypto investors track and generate tax reports for funds worth over $250 million last year.

Tax Agency Has Info on 20,000 Crypto Traders

Earlier this year, Skattestyrelsen announced that it had been authorized by the country’s tax council, Skatterådet, to obtain information on crypto traders using local exchanges. The agency then announced on Aug. 29 that it had acquired information on 20,000 citizens trading cryptocurrency on these platforms. The tax agency declared:

For the first time, the tax authorities have received information on trading, for example, bitcoins, on Danish crypto exchanges. In total, information of approx. 20,000 citizens.

The exchanges were required to provide information on all crypto purchases and sales made between Jan. 1, 2016, and Dec. 31, 2018. The data obtained includes “identification information such as names, addresses, social security numbers and possibly CVR [business registration] information,” Skattestyrelsen revealed.

How Crypto Transactions Are Taxed in Denmark

The Danish tax authority explains on its website that trading bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is considered speculation, meaning that the purpose of acquiring them is to make a profit. Therefore, as a general rule, profits or losses from their sales must be disclosed to the tax authority. Anyone unclear whether their trading activities are considered speculation can ask the tax agency for a specific “binding” answer, which costs DKK 400 ($60) and takes between 3-6 months. The answer is valid for a maximum of five years.

The letters sent to some 20,000 crypto traders request information about profits and losses from crypto transactions made during the fiscal year 2016 through 2018, calculated using the FIFO method. The tax agency’s website describes:

If you have several purchases, you must initially calculate profits and losses according to the FIFO principle (FIFO = First In First Out). This means that the bitcoins you bought first are the ones you sell first.

Tax Agencies Worldwide Turning Attention to Cryptocurrencies

A growing number of tax authorities worldwide are turning their attention to cryptocurrencies as they have become more popular with growing market capitalizations. Koinly asserted Monday that “Tax agencies are taking note of bitcoin and want to avoid it being seen as a safe haven from taxes.” CEO Singh noted that Denmark has special laws about how capital gains are reported, elaborating:

You can only offset profits with losses from the same cryptocurrency during the same income tax year. This is different from how it works in other countries so existing solutions require a lot of manual work.

The Danish tax authority is not the only one that has sent letters to crypto investors. The U.S., Canada, and India are among the countries that have similarly sent letters to crypto owners seeking to tax their crypto gains.

In July, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that it sent out letters to over 10,000 crypto investors reminding them of their tax obligations. The IRS has also stepped up other efforts to identify and convict crypto tax evaders. In its report issued last week, the agency emphasized that “Cryptocurrencies are undermining the financial and tax system,” adding that cyber criminals “now deal in cryptocurrency, again thinking this will make them anonymous, but our agents have once again proved that there is nowhere to hide. We will not stop in our pursuit.” Furthermore, the IRS is now using a new tax form requiring all tax filers to disclose whether they received, sold, sent, exchanged, or acquired any crypto during the year.

“As regulations and guidelines around cryptocurrency taxes clear up, more people are likely to receive similar letters,” Koinly wrote. “This is just the first step in the fight against tax evasion and more serious actions are likely to be taken against investors in the future so it is a good idea to get your affairs in order as early as possible.” News.Bitcoin.com has previously published a tax guide as well as a list of useful tax tools for crypto owners.

The pseudonymous developer is known for his work throughout the Lightning developer community, working on both the Lightning Labs and c-Lightning implementations over the past two years, another tweet said.

With the grant, Square Crypto said the developer is able to “leave behind his day job of 14 years” to work full time on Lightning and bitcoin.

Lightning Labs infrastructure lead Alex Bosworth said in an email the funding looked like a one-time grant and is not part of the Square Crypto developer team’s general mandate.

“I think the focus is broadly on bitcoin and they are still figuring out a good intersection of helping bitcoin and pursuing their development interests. They have a great team and a lot of freedom to pursue different directions,” Bosworth said.

Despite claims that ZmnSCPxj is an anonymous individual, Lightning developers likely know his identity. The individual attended October’s Lightning Conference in Berlin, giving a presentation during the conference’s second day. The developer also appears to have spoken to others, such as c-Lightning’s Rusty Russel, under Chatham House rules.

The Evolving Bitcoin Landscape in Argentina

The temperature has steadily been rising in the Argentinian crypto space for several months of 2019, creating a clear timeline for the increased acceptance of bitcoin and other alternative assets. The nation’s economy and fiat currency have been especially wobbly since August 2019 as the stock market hemorrhaged during an upset presidential election. In addition to damaging the return value on investments, this also caused the peso’s value to plummet. Very soon after this initial trigger, the relative valuation and trading volume of bitcoin spiked to levels comparable to conflict-stricken regions like Hong Kong.

The Central Bank of Argentina, run by the national government, attempted to stabilize the situation first by imposing limitations on the purchase of USD. Beginning by limiting Argentinians to only $10,000 in purchases per month in September 2019, the bank added additional restrictions on October 31, 2019. In addition to limiting the amount of USD that a citizen can acquire per month to $200, the bank also announced that bitcoin could only be purchased by means of “funds transferred from a bank account.”

Since this time, the relative valuation and trade volume of bitcoin have spiked yet again in Argentina, even compared to the initial increase when the peso first hit shaky territory. The bitcoin price was reported to reach as high as $12,759 on an Argentinian exchange in November 2019, marking a 38 percent premium compared to other exchanges around the world. In that same month, Argentina exchanged an estimated 19.4 million pesos on LocalBitcoins.

To make better sense of the dynamics of these changes, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to several Argentinian bitcoiners to learn more about their firsthand experiences.

Santiago Siri is the founder of the Democracy Earth Foundation and has been involved in both crypto-related political activism and the largest bitcoin exchange in Latin America, Bitex, for several years. Having moved to New York from Argentina, Siri has maintained a base of connections across the international crypto space and particularly in his country of origin.

Lautaro Dragan, on the other hand, is the lead developer for decentralized media protocol Po.et and has in-depth experience with both the Argentinian banking system and the situation on the ground as he lives in Buenos Aires.

Searching for Alternatives

Siri claimed that there is a direct correspondence between the suppression of the dollar and the rise of bitcoin in Argentina.

“Since the peso is a currency that lacks trust from the people due to its high inflation rate (about 50 precent), most people save money in dollars,” Siri said. “But keeping dollars in the bank can be risky since this is not the first time this happens. Back in 2001, the country lived one of its most traumatic days when a similar limit was imposed. The growth of adoption in Bitcoin is a no brainer to most: censorship resistant money that cannot be taken by the government matters to the average Argentine that does not want to see their money being taken away by the government.”

This dynamic is of particular importance to regions of global instability, he added.

“When people start stashing cash, that also increases the risk of violent assaults and overall insecurity of the country,” Siri explained. “Back in 2001, a rise in ‘express kidnapping’ emerged from criminals chasing people taking their money out of the bank ... so the ability to keep the money in an immutable ledger and protected by a code no one can break is also very beneficial there.”

Dragan concurred with this analysis but also added some sobering commentary.

“It’s a bittersweet feeling,” he claimed, “because even though we’re happy we have Bitcoin to help us in this situation, nobody is happy about the restrictions, since they affect everyone for the worse and are a symptom of deeply-rooted economic issues.”

Dragan said that hyperinflation in the Argentine peso has been a regular feature of the country for his entire life, since “reading my high school history book and seeing in it a black-and-white picture of a panettone selling for 1 million pesos, and [growing] up on stories of people losing most of their savings due to them being force-converted to ARS and inflation immediately striking afterwards, or hyper-inflation rendering your entire salary worthless.”



He explained that many Argentinians turn to alternative currencies as a chance to access the most basic features of financial security.

“The sad truth is that, as things are, most people can’t save a single cent,” Dragan said. “The ones who can save buy USD to prevent their savings from being eaten by hyperinflation, and the lucky ones who work digitally look for remote work paid in USD, GBP or EUR to prevent their salaries from being eaten by hyperinflation.”

After many personal difficulties with regularly using foreign fiat currencies or opening up a U.S. bank account, Dragan said that he began to turn increasingly to cryptocurrency.

“Even though bitcoin is too volatile to be a good store of value right now, it’s possibly the best means of transferring value humanity has ever seen,” he said. “And that alone is such a powerful tool that makes a case for crypto on its own, but it will probably also ensure it will live long enough for it to become a good store of value too.”

Argentina’s Bitcoin Community

Siri described the Argentinian cryptocurrency space as “a very active community that has grown big very fast,” while noting that there is room for Bitcoin to grow.

“Probably we are still a long way from making Bitcoin a mainstream thing, but you'll probably find among the hacker culture of Buenos Aires some of the best cryptocurrency engineers in the world,” Siri said. “It's worth noticing the emergence of startups like Zeppelin (leading smart contract auditors in the world) or RSK (smart contracts with a BTC sidechain) that emerge from that hacker culture. I'm currently helping to bring Devcon 6, the annual event held by the Ethereum Foundation, to Buenos Aires in 2020.”

Dragan concurred with this assessment.

“In Argentina, we have had a few small businesses accept bitcoin for several years, but we’re now seeing larger businesses joining too,” he said. “Last year, Garbarino Viajes, one of Argentina’s biggest travel agencies, took the lead on this, accepting bitcoin as a means of payments. This year, Mercado Libre, an Argentine company that operates in all of Latin America, started accepting bitcoin in Brazil. More large business are sure to follow.”

Dragan added that more institutional adoption could be forthcoming.

“I’m confident we will see more of this in the 2020s, and traditional banks will start feeling the pressure and want in,” he said.

To this end, Bitex, the Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that Siri is a partner in, has facilitated smoother entry of private banks into the wider crypto-economic system.

“The regulation announced by the Central Bank specifically forbid buying cryptocurrency with credit cards but said nothing about direct bank transfers,” Siri said. “Bitex has been one of the pioneering bitcoin exchanges in the local market there and has been able to establish solid relations with banks in the country. Still, a lot of bank managers, due to age or lack of information are a bit skeptical about accepting services willing to operate using BTC ... But, thankfully, this is beginning to change thanks to the reputation built by companies like Bitex.”

Dragan also noted some mixed institutional progress in Bitcoin adoption, noting the potential for regulatory clarity from the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (AFIP), Argentina’s revenue service, though with some skepticism about how much of a help this will ultimately be for local Bitcoiners.

“I know the AFIP, our tax authority, is working on ways to properly support cryptocurrencies, and the new policies and laws make it clear that the government is aware they need to do something about it, but they still don’t understand it well and isn’t a high priority given all the issues our country is facing, so adoption grows slowly but steadily,” he said.

Of course, the cryptocurrency space in Argentina is not only turning to bitcoin, largely due to the perception Dragan highlighted that the asset is better at transferring value than storing it long-term. The Ethereum-based stablecoin DAI, Dragan claimed, “has been growing like crazy” in Argentina. Siri agreed with this, telling us, “Most people cannot afford big swings on their savings. That's why adoption of DAI is growing in Argentina: you want a currency that cannot be taken away by a bank, that is pegged to the dollar and that is stable in order to be able to use it for saving.”

“Bitcoin as a Financial Battleground”

Siri also commented on how crackdowns on Bitcoin can play out on a global economic stage.

“It's interesting to see how Bitcoin is being weaponized by Nation-State actors,” he said. “Because Bitcoin can be used either for good or for bad, we can find some extreme cases on how various sanctioned nations like Venezuela and North Korea have tried to use cryptocurrency both within their own borders and when dealing with other nations.”

“I'm not stating all this to say bad things about Bitcoin: I'm a long-time HODLer myself,” Siri continued. “But it is important to understand how Bitcoin is becoming the battleground of a financial battle that is being pushed by the USA and its economic sanctions mechanism.”

Even with the price already rising in Argentina due to these internal pressures, we can already see how this “bitcoin as a financial battleground” thesis has played out more recently. On December 2, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new set of tariffs on metal products, especially steel and aluminum, from Argentina. On December 9, 2019, the Argentinian president appointed a new economy minister to his cabinet, who has repeatedly voiced skepticism of institutions like the International Monetary Fund with close ties to U.S. international economic designs. Whether motivated directly by these developments or not, fears of further peso inflation and economic downturn have likely caused bitcoin’s value in Argentina to spike yet again: LocalBitcoins trading volume in Argentina reached a new all-time high of 22 million ARS in the first week of December 2019.

As a parting sentiment, Siri wanted audiences abroad to appreciate Argentina’s unique and valuable relationship with financial assets across the board.

“Argentina will break every single financial system you can think of,” he claimed. “Whether it's the Argentine peso, the US dollar, Bitcoin, Ethereum or anything that ends up coming next ... we Argentines are going to make sure we figure out how to hack it.”

While it’s noteworthy that, for the average citizen, a stablecoin like DAI might be a more reliable way to protect paychecks and savings than either the fiat currency or bitcoin, the past few months of increasing bitcoin trading volume and adoption among economic uncertainty in Argentina illustrate a real-life use case for the technology.

“If Bitcoin is to supplant the USD, I’m sure it won’t happen for decades,” Dragan concluded. “But the key takeaway here is that we don’t need it to. Bitcoin is an excellent means of transferring value as it is. Even in the hypothetical case that we discovered it is impossible for it to scale, it already is good enough.”

2019-12-12,"Bitcoin miners in China now control 65% of the cryptocurrency network's processing power (hash rate), according to research by digital assets manager CoinShares.

In its latest report, shared with The Block, CoinShares said 65% of global bitcoin mining happens in China, and the country’s Sichuan province alone produces 54% of global hash rate. The remaining 35% of bitcoin miners are spread from the U.S. to Russia and Kazakhstan.

The Chinese share of hash rate, up from 60% in June, is reportedly the highest recorded by CoinShares since it began tracking hash rate almost two years ago. CoinShares said the development of the last 6 months has been mainly one of expansion.





Source:CoinShares

“More than anything miners have been taking advantage of increased cashflows, especially in spring and summer, from rejuvenated bitcoin prices to reinvest in more powerful and more efficient mining gear – both to secure their share of network hashrate against the advent of next-generation hardware, and as an efficiency preparation for the upcoming block reward halving,” per the report, authored by Christopher Bendiksen, head of research at CoinShares and Samuel Gibbons, research analyst at the firm.

Major improvements in mining hardware have also made their way into the bitcoin network, per the report. Key players are Bitmain (with their Antminer 15 and 17 series) and MicroBT (Whatsminer 10 and 20 series). Bitfury (Clarke chipset), Canaan (Avalon 10-series), Innosilicon (T3 unit) and Ebang (E10 model) also contributed, said CoinShares.

Bitmain’s declining market share

While Bitmain is one of the key players, its market share by hash rate has fallen from ~70% in June to ~66% now, according to the report. In June 2017, Bitmain’s own estimates (via Frost and Sullivan) showed that it had a market share of around 75%.

“Bitmain needs fresh inflows of capital mainly to heal a series of self-inflicted wounds caused by poor strategic decisions,” said Bendiksen and Gibbons, adding: “Judging from internal leaks and the financial statements released as part of their failed Hong Kong IPO bid, Bitmain has suffered from serial malinvestment, ranging from failed tape-outs, hardware overproduction, overhiring, and perhaps worst of all, its disastrously performing and likely captive BCH [bitcoin cash] holdings. All these factors have been contributing to balance sheet issues which, according to a recent leaked internal memo by Bitmain chairman and co-founder Jihan Wu, almost sunk the company in early 2019.”

CoinShares further said that at current bitcoin prices, the average miner is profitable. However, going into the reward halving in the spring of 2020 the company said equipment matters.

""Older gear such as the venerable Antminer S9, which is still widely deployed in the network, will likely be approaching the end of its useful lifetime unless the price of Bitcoin rises dramatically, or indeed if more operators gain access to electricity around or below ¢1/kWh,"" it concluded.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Chinese Bitcoin miners now control a record proportion of the network’s hashrate, according to new research. An estimated 65% of BTC mining now happens in China.

CoinShares, a digital asset investment fund, noted this high since the firm started monitoring the network in late 2017.

Research jointly published in October 2018 out of Princeton and Florida International University estimated that 74% of Bitcoin hashpower is managed by Chinese mining pools⁠, a service that allows miners to pool their resources to reduce the randomness in Bitcoin block reward payouts. However, these figures are a poor gauge of mining centralization because miners from any geographic location can participate in these pools.

Mining is centralized in China because most Bitcoin hardware is manufactured in the country ⁠— with juggernauts like Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT dominating the landscape. Chinese customers tend to get preferential pricing and avoid the friction of tariffs and shipping, according to sources familiar with the industry.

Meanwhile, cheap hydro-power makes Sichuan one of the best places in the world to deploy mining hardware. An estimated 54% of the global mining share happens out of this region of China alone.

“The centralization of hashrate threatens the ultimate promise of cryptocurrency networks: that no one party or group controls the ledger or flow of transactions,” said mining expert Kristy-Leigh Minehan to Crypto Briefing. “Any number of natural disasters or state-level threats could introduce network turmoil, whether through increased block times, transaction costs, or transaction censorship at the state-level.”

These figures run contrary to the narrative that the U.S. is on the rise as a mining hub that could challenge China. In October, Bitmain launched a 50 megawatt facility in Texas. Just last month, Northern Bitcoin AG and Whinstone U.S. Inc. merged to open a 100-acre Bitcoin facility in the same state.

Yet, the trade war between the United States and China jeopardizes the American mining industry. Growing tariffs on hardware will further harm margins.

Whether mining centralization will actually impact the trajectory of Bitcoin, however, is still hotly debated.","ING, the largest bank in the Netherlands with over $980 billion in total assets, is said to be getting into a crowded cryptocurrency custody market.

A Reuters report on Thursday, citing “people familiar with the matter” said that ING is working on developing technology to help clients safely store cryptocurrencies.

The custody project is being run out of Amsterdam and is still in its early days, per the report. ING told Reuters that it “sees increasing opportunities with regard to digital assets on both asset backed and native security tokens.”



Interestingly, ING recently said that “cash is still king,” and that for cryptocurrencies to catch on, it will need to be proven ""useful, relevant and trustworthy."" It also said that ""technical improvements are needed"" for cryptocurrencies to become mainstream.

More traditional financial firms are getting into cryptocurrency space. Last year, Fidelity launched a separate unit, Fidelity Digital Assets, to provide cryptocurrency custody and trading services to institutional investors. This November it received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services to provide services to clients based in the state.

Japanese bank Nomura has also been preparing to launch a custody solution for digital assets in partnership with Ledger. Their solution is expected to launch next year. Germany also recently passed a law, effective Jan. 1, 2020, which would allow authorized companies to offer crypto services, including custody.","A recent YouTube channel identifies useful browser plugins that all cryptocurrency users should know. Several browser extensions – plugins – are useful and even are sometimes necessary for cryptocurrency users.

Popular web browsers like Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Brave, and Safari support several of such browser plugins. Crypto users have a particular need for the browser extensions to check market prices, perform cryptocurrency payments in-browser, and enhance their privacy/security.

This article aims to highlight the top browser plugins and why they are important to crypto users.

Cryptocurrency Wallet Extensions

Crypto wallet plugins allow you to access blockchain powered smartphone apps, conduct crypto transactions, and receive and send crypto assets as you access the internet.

For example, metamask is a necessary crypto wallet plugin that cryptocurrency users need to use in your cryptocurrency transactions. The extension is available for Brave, Opera, Firefox, and Chrome. Metamask enables Ethereum users to make use of this plugin to send and receive Ether and Ethereum tokens as well as accessing other Ethereum-enabled dapps in their browsers.

Badger is another important plugin that allows users to store and send Bitcoin Cash and the SLP tokens built on the Bitcoin Cash protocol. The non-custodial web wallet not only allows micropayments and in-app purchases using Bitcoin Cash but also access to Bitcoin Cash decentralized apps.

Market Data Plugins

Market data extensions enable cryptocurrency users to check the prices of various cryptocurrencies in real-time. The information you gather will, therefore, help you to make informed investment decisions for your digital assets.

Bitcoin Tab is a Chrome extension that you can rely on to get information about various market data. This plugin is designed to enable you to get real-time prices of various cryptocurrencies as well as news related to various cryptocurrencies. The extension also gives a snapchat of what’s happening across the crypto industry at a glance.

Precautions and Privacy

Precautions and privacy plugins are designed to enhance privacy and security of crypto users. Chrome Web Store has many varieties of the available plugins under this category.

Before you install a privacy and precautions plugin, ensure to check the number of installs and the user ratings. Normally, a low number of installs and poor ratings are signs that a plugin doesn’t deliver on its promise.

As soon as you install Chrome plugin, you need to install an AdBlock to prevent hackers from using it to access your personal details associated with your cryptocurrency wallets.

Takeaway

The three main categories of browser plugins play vital roles, which cryptocurrency users should be aware of. To get the best out of these extensions, it’s now upon your responsibility to look for information about efficiency and how each plugin functions. It’s also advisable not to install any new or untested plugins whose authenticity is unverified.","A closer look at bitcoin holdings data shows a potentially troubling trend among the anonymous accounts — increased consolidation among large owners.

Investors with 1,000 to 1 million bitcoins, often referred to as whales, hold 42.1% of all bitcoin supply, up from 37.9% during the height of the speculative bubble two years ago, according data from researcher Coin Metrics.

While small retail holders, investing a few hundred or thousand dollars, trickled in during and after the 2017 boom, the rising ownership concentration means that the sway big holders have over prices is likely increasing. Only about 3.5% of all addresses are actively trading on any given week, according to Flipside Crypto, another researcher.

“The problem with a few large players holding crypto is that when they sell they can easily push the price down, which makes the market susceptible to rapid swings,” said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who has published research on market manipulation in cryptocurrencies.

Overall, the top 1,000 addresses control 34.8% of all available bitcoin, up slightly from 34.4% at the end of 2017, according to Flipside. Meanwhile, more than 27 million wallets held a balance of fewer than 10 bitcoins as of September, per researcher TokenAnalyst.

Much of the recent accumulation likely happened among investors who are not wedded to the bitcoin dream, warned Aaron Brown, an investor and writer. The top 10,000 to 100,000 addresses are likely held by family offices and high-net worth individuals who may not stick around if the coin doesn’t perform, he said. Such addresses now account for 15% of bitcoin supply, Brown said, up from 10% just 18 months ago.

“I doubt they have infinite patience, and without significant growth in actual use, I would expect them to quietly withdraw to chase other promising technologies,” Brown said. “They have no great financial or ideological commitment to either crypto or the ideals and technologies behind it.” Bitcoin’s wild price swings prevent the coin’s wide adoption in commerce.

Bitcoin is still one of the highest returning speculative assets this year, almost doubling to around $7,180 despite dramatic pricefluctuations. That is on the back of last year’s 74% slump and 2017’s 1,400% surge.

There is speculation that some of the whale accounts are in fact exchanges and custodians, holding coins for many clients. A unit of Fidelity Investments began offering crypto custody services this year, for example. But because bitcoin addresses are anonymous, the exact impact is hard to gauge; Flipside believes exchanges hold about 5% of available coin supply, while Coin Metrics pegs the number at 20%.

“Bitcoin will remain volatile,” said Eric Stone, head of data science at Boston-based Flipside. “A few really big wallets own a lot of the currency. Exchange marketplaces are unregulated and not audited. So there’s just a lot of potential for someone who wants to manipulate the market to do so.”

","Bitfinex, the crypto exchange and sister company of Tether coin, has activated its partnership with Chainalysis, a New York-based provider of compliance software for real-time monitoring of cryptocurrencies transactions.

The self-described “leading provider of AML software for Bitcoin” allows cryptocurrency exchanges to distinguish suspicious patterns in real-time and obtain law enforcement information. The company’s offering also includes a KYC solution, dubbed Chainalysis KYT (“Know Your Transaction”).

Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao – The Largest Financial B2B Expo

The announcement comes amid reports linking Bitfinex to drug trafficking and money-laundering schemes operated by the owners of Crypto Capital.

Over the past year, Chainalysis deployed its real-time anti-money laundering and compliance software, and also expanded its coverage beyond Bitcoin to include Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and stablecoins.

“The solution does not share information identifying users, which is kept strictly in-house. We are excited to work alongside the Chainalysis team to continue to build out a safe and robust platform for our users,” said Peter Warrack, Chief Compliance Officer at Bitfinex.

Binance also signed up for Chainalysis KYT

Chainalysis’ compliance software can help both crypto firms and law enforcement agencies detect suspicious activity in order to battle any related criminal activity. It uses pattern recognition, algorithms, and millions of open source references to “identify and categorize thousands of cryptocurrency services to raise live alerts on transactions involved in suspicious activity,” the company says.

The company has already signed other major cryptocurrency exchanges, including the likes of Binance, to automate their process of screening transactions and monitoring user activity.

Chainalysis has a few rivals in the market whose solutions strive to prevent, detect, and investigate cryptocurrency money laundering, fraud, and compliance violations. The biggest competitor, though, is the UK-based Elliptic, which offers proprietary compliance and fraud detection technology.

The concerns over cryptocurrency mining, trading, and usage to transfer money are already shared by several ‎governments‏ ‏across the globe.

Of note, the cryptocurrency industry has recently seen several hires from mainstream finance firms in order to respond to the recent calls to regulate the nascent business, which are gathering steam with several regulators now require the operators of such venues to perform the same level of client due diligence as banks do.

Extending AML regulations to cryptocurrency activities is being considered in several countries around the world, such as Australia and the UK, and already tracks the EU’s recent push to regulate Bitcoin.","Mainstream Investment Vehicles Tied to Cryptocurrencies Grow Exponentially

These days bitcoin and a variety of other digital assets are now being traded as funds and traditional equity holdings. The landscape of crypto investment vehicles has changed significantly as institutional and retail investors don’t need direct exposure to cryptocurrencies in order to invest in this technology.

Traditional Investment Products Tethered to Digital Assets

Bitcoin has been around for more than a decade and the digital asset has invoked the creation of trusts, exchange-traded products, cash-settled futures, and investment funds. Investment products like these are tied to cryptocurrencies like BTC but there’s a slew of others that track baskets of coins and single assets like ETH, BCH, and XRP. Derivatives products allow investors to trade crypto-based futures and options adding a whole new landscape to digital currency markets. For products like these, customers don’t need to hold the cryptocurrency or be concerned about storage as the exposure is quite different than traditional crypto spot markets.

Crypto Products Managed by Grayscale, CME Group, Erisx, Amun AG, Ledgerx, and Wisdomtree

One of the earliest investment vehicles tethered to BTC is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) which launched on September 25, 2013. Originally GBTC was an investment for accredited investors only but the product eventually received FINRA approval so eligible shares could trade publicly. The Trust is not an exchange-traded fund (ETF) per se, but the product is modeled in a similar fashion. GBTC can be traded on the over-the-counter market OTCQX and since the trust’s launch, Grayscale has created a variety of other investment solutions for other cryptocurrencies. Currently, there’s the Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust, Litecoin Trust, Stellar Lumens Trust, Horizen Trust, Zcash Trust, XRP Trust, and the Digital Large Cap Fund.

Investors can also purchase bitcoin exchange futures offered by the global markets company CME Group. The company announced it was offering BTC-based futures on October 31, 2017, and investors have been able to trade the derivatives product since December 2017. Essentially CME Group’s BTC futures are cash-settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR). The BRR allows the exchange to reference the daily rate of BTC prices measured in USD. Each contract unit is equal to five bitcoins and with a margin rate of 35%, investors can trade the BTC product on CME Globex and CME Clearport.

Investors interested in crypto futures products can also trade with Bakkt, but the offerings are physically settled futures. Additionally in July, Erisx was approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and granted a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license. Ledgerx was also CFTC approved a week prior by receiving a designated contract market (DCM) license so the firm can provide new derivatives products. More futures contracts that utilize bitcoin cash (BCH) will soon be available at a CFTC-regulated exchange during the first quarter of 2020.

News.Bitcoin.com just reported on Amun AG getting its base prospectus approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA). Right now Amun manages nine exchange-traded products (ETPs) that are traded on Swiss Bourse. The company offers the Amun Bitcoin Suisse ETP (ticker: ABBA) a fund that tracks prices for both ETH and BTC.

Alongside this, Amun’s other index ETPs consist of the ‘Hodl’ crypto basket, the Bitwise Select 10, and the Sygnum Platform Winners ETP. Amun also offers six single digital currency tracking ETPs for BCH, BNB, BTC, XRP, ETH, and XTZ. Investors can obtain Amun products on the Swiss exchange SIX and after the SFSA approval Amun plans to expand into more European markets. Another ETP listed on Swiss Bourse is Wisdomtree’s physically-settled ETP which was recently listed on the stock exchange. The New York-based Wisdomtree ETP called BTCW allows people to invest in BTC “without needing to set up with a custodian themselves.”

ETPs and Traditional Finance Applications Changed the Precious Metals Landscape, Will It Do the Same to Cryptocurrencies?

On December 7, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Stone Ridge Trust VI registration and the firm is cleared to launch the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund. The fund invests in BTC futures contracts that are cash-settled on CFTC registered exchanges. A similar fund from France launched on December 6 when the French asset management firm Napoleon AM launched the “Napoleon Bitcoin Fund.” The fund is only available to residents of France and it requires a $110,000 buy-in. Just like the Stone Ridge Bitcoin Strategy Fund the Napoleon Bitcoin Fund will use CME Group-based cash-settled BTC futures.

Just like precious metals markets in the eighties, digital currencies are finding a home within traditional finance. Exchange-traded products, trusts and other types of investment funds transformed gold and precious metals markets 16 years ago. During the late nineties, precious metal-based funds started to grow exponentially, but the first gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) didn’t launch until March 28, 2003. The same thing is happening with bitcoin and other digital currencies within the cryptoconomy. Even though there’s a wide range of traditional investment vehicles tied to crypto many speculators are patiently waiting for a U.S. approved Bitcoin ETF. So far, after many attempts from myriad firms the U.S. regulator (SEC) still hasn’t approved a Bitcoin ETF. Despite the lack of a regulated ETF in the U.S., firms like Amun, Bakkt, Grayscale, CME Group, Wisdomtree, and others still provide traditional investment vehicles tied to crypto.

Croatian Post, the biggest provider of postal services in the Republic of Croatia, is now offering a cryptocurrency exchange service at 55 post offices throughout the country. Currently, five cryptocurrencies are supported. This follows a successful implementation and positive results of a pilot program at a few branches. The Post found interest in this service and plans to offer additional crypto services in the future.

55 Croatian Post Branches Can Exchange Crypto

Croatian Post announced on Wednesday that its customers can now exchange five cryptocurrencies for Croatian kuna at 55 post offices throughout the country. Croatian Post is the biggest provider of postal services in Croatia. In addition to offering postal, financial, retail, and insurance services, the Post declared:

Starting December 11, all Croatian and foreign service users will be able to convert their cryptocurrencies to HRK in just a few simple steps.

The announcement explains that once a customer submits a crypto exchange request, “a QR code will be scanned and you will receive cash at a post office.” Currently, five cryptocurrencies are supported: bitcoin core, ether, stellar, XRP, and EOS.

Croatian Post’s website lists all of the 55 post offices with the crypto exchange service and provides a calculator for customers to find out how much HRK they will receive from the Post for exchanging their cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency exchange is carried out in cooperation with Electrocoin, a Croatian crypto brokerage and payment processing provider.

Noting that “Digitization is one of our development strategies and a driver of numerous business projects,” the Post further announced:

In the future, we also plan to introduce the option to buy cryptocurrencies at Croatian Post’s post offices, thus making them the central points for cryptocurrency transactions across Croatia.

Successful Pilot Project and Other Countries

Croatian Post currently has 1,016 post offices, 2,135 counters, and more than 10,000 employees, according to its website. The crypto exchange service launch at 55 post offices follows “a successful implementation and positive results of the pilot project for cryptocurrency exchange in post offices in Zadar,” the Post detailed, adding:

The pilot project has shown that there is an interest for this type of service, which is why Croatian Post will introduce the service of cryptocurrency exchange at post offices across the country.

The same five cryptocurrencies were offered in the pilot project, which was implemented in three post offices in Zadar, a city on Croatia’s Dalmatian coast. “In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of cryptocurrency users, who very often plan to travel to those places where they can convert their digital money to the national currency,” the Post elaborated on Wednesday. “Due to a wide range of possibilities this service offers, the numerous guests visiting Croatia will find our cities even more interesting.”

Post offices in a few other countries have been offering similar services such as in Liechtenstein and Austria. In February, Liechtensteinische Post started selling BTC. Since then, ETH, LTC, and XRP have been added and the service is currently available at post offices in Vaduz and Schaan. In Austria, over 400 Austria post office branches and about 1,350 post partner stores throughout the country sell Bitpanda crypto vouchers which can be redeemed online, Bitpanda’s website details. Croatians can also trade BCH on Bitcoin.com’s non-custodian, peer-to-peer marketplace.

Despite trading significantly down from their record highs of late December 2017, large-cap cryptocurrencies had a phenomenal year and remain one of the greatest investment success stories of the decade.

Cementing themselves as the world’s leading asset class for yearly performance, cryptocurrencies have risen well above annualized returns of the U.S. equities, commodities and bond markets for 2019.

Ryan Alfred, President and co-founder of Digital Assets Data said large-cap crypto assets possess significantly higher returns versus traditional markets for this year.

“Looking back at the performance of the top ten large-caps (Bitwise 10) in comparison to other major asset classes, we can see their special signature,” Alfred said.

Crypto versus traditional assets

Credit: Digital Asset Data

As seen in the chart above, research provided by Digital Assets Data shows how this year’s performance of the top 10 cryptos by market capitalization fared against other major asset classes such as gold, oil and equities.

Of course, 2019 didn’t start out that way. Back in February, the top 10 crypto began a fairly dismal run, resting well below all other traditional asset classes when viewing their return on investment figures. However, sentiment began to pick up significantly in March and by mid-year, cryptocurrencies were far out ahead of other the other assets.

That gap has begun to narrow as stocks, bonds and commodities begin to increase their lead. Yet cryptocurrencies remain significantly ahead of all other asset classes as the year comes to a close.

Much of this rally is courtesy of bitcoin (BTC). The world’s first cryptocurrency is currently up 100 percent since the year began. Meanwhile, Ether, the world’s second-largest crypto is up 35 percent year-to-date, though XRP is down 25 percent from where it traded on Jan. 1.

The big picture: Crypto’s success story

In the year before the decade began, the world was in the throes of a financial crisis. Since then, stocks have rebounded. From its March 2009 market meltdown lows to now, the S&P 500 has gained a respectable 369 percent. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has also had a good run, up 326 percent in that same time period.

Bitcoin Price Index

However, BTC has blasted those figures, rising well above a staggering 12 million percent (yes, you read that correctly) over a one-year-shorter time frame, beginning March 2010. That’s when the price of 1 BTC was around $0.05, data taken from Messari shows.

Crypto’s success can likely be attributed to its most defining characteristics: high volatility and liquidity, allowing market participants to quickly and easily trade between digital and fiat currencies.

Lorenzo Pellegrino, CEO of Skrill, a cross-border payments platform utilizing crypto, said digital assets resembled a nascent market. Prices bouncing around in a frantic manner enable the asset class to outperform all others based on irrational sentiment and low barriers to entry."

Anthony Pompliano is the co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital.

Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano is one of bitcoin’s biggest boosters. His Twitter feed is a hurricane of crypto-news, self-promotion and inspirational quotes for hodlers of heavy bags. He ends every week with a summary of bitcoin’s biggest accomplishments, always including the un-ironically cheerful: “bitcoin still not dead.”

This past year, Pomp served as crypto’s ambassador to traditional finance in appearances on CNBC’s Squawk Box. He also defended bitcoin against notable skeptic Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary. Just this week, he called out Mark Cuban for saying bitcoin has “no chance.”

Pomp’s playing the long game. Not only will bitcoin survive, but it will become the world’s reserve currency, he believes (optimistically).

CoinDesk caught up with Pompliano to discuss the year in crypto, how to strike successful investments, and the ups and downs of being a public figure in crypto.

You’ve been a prominent figure in the space for a while now. In your opinion what were some of the most pivotal moments in crypto for 2019?

If you go back to the beginning of the year, I think the most significant events were the bottoming of the bear market, Libra and the significant advancements made in China. However, I think the most significant advance in crypto was made in institutional adoption, which doesn’t mean institutions like banks coming aboard, but institutions like university endowments, hospital insurance the real asset allocators. They have come in in a material way.

Why are these players coming around to crypto now?

I think there is a separation between blockchain and bitcoin, and they’ve gotten comfortable with blockchain. There’s still discomfort with bitcoin. It’s becoming clear we’ll have an automated world, and in order for that to happen you’ll need digital assets. Blockchain is just the way to keep track, it’s an accounting system. I think that’s why we’ve been successful raising capital. There’s a belief in blockchain fitting into other technology trends that investors are already buying into. This isn’t anything different. It is actually just enhancing trends people are already buying into.

There's a stark line in the sand between Libra and bitcoin. That's helpful because it shows the value of bitcoin for people.

Could you spell out how crypto fits into the trend of automation and technological adoption.

For us, it’s a foundational component of the technological change taking place. I always joke, we never have anyone come into our office and say ‘Hey, we’re building a Microsoft Excel Company.’ If you think about automation of micro-transactions or high frequency transactions between a bunch of connected devices, there’s no way current way to keep track of it all. If you need interoperability between systems, these public open source, permissionless ledgers allow you to do that in a really interesting way. Our investment thesis on the technology is just that blockchain will be pervasive, and to get ahead of it now rather than wait 10 years. So it’s really flipping it on its head and saying, ‘it’s not so much about the technology, as it is finding these great companies that happen to use this one piece of technology.’

What was Libra’s effect on investment sentiment?

Libra is actually a pretty good idea. From a sentiment standpoint, there’s three things. One, it’s forced central banks and regulators around the world to think through their approach to cryptocurrencies. Second, the response in the United States hasn’t been as positive as we would have wished. There’s been a lot of negative backlash, almost like a helicopter parent approach. The third thing is it’s really drawn a stark line in the sand between Libra and bitcoin. I think that’s helpful because it shows the value of bitcoin for people, because now they have something to compare it to.

Do you think any of the backlash against Libra is is justified?

I actually think regulators should be less worried about Libra and more worried about digital currencies created by the banks. Facebook will be one of 100 corporations that governs Libra. The only way for a decision to be made in Libra is for multiple corporations, across continents, in different industries, some for-profit some nonprofit, to come together and make a decision. So it’d be really difficult for one player to be nefarious, because your consensus is among all of these players.

Compare that to J. P. Morgan or Wells Fargo to making decisions alone. They’re the only ones that are in control. My fear with the banks is they’ll launch a digital currency. It’ll be adopted internally to move capital around. It’ll move to their corporate partners. It’ll gain some retail traction. You’ll start using it to buy things. Then one day in the future, they’ll just unpeg it from the dollar. They only have to make that decision themselves. I get that people are upset, but the nuances of the structure are more important than just a binary this is good, that is bad.

The Chinese government is also working on its own digital currency. Recently members of the Federal Reserve have come out saying they’re researching a U.S. dollar backed stablecoin. How does this fit into your worldview?

The U.S. today is in a defensive mindset where they’re trying to protect the monetary supremacy they have. I just published an article, arguing that the U.S. is suffering from an “innovator’s dilemma.” We’ve had it really good for a long time, but when this new technology comes out, if we don’t act, it will disrupt us. So the rational thing to do is to create a digital dollar. To do exactly what China is doing, but let it stand for the democratic and capitalistic ideals we hold sacred. I still think that bitcoin ends up winning out over a very long time period.

Do you think bitcoin’s ultimate success is reliant on mass consumer adoption?

It’s like religion. Missionaries go to some far-off land to tell people about this God that they’ve never heard of before. And once they hear the word of God, they become believers. Maybe. But more likely, we’re going to get to a situation where you need a decentralized, non-censored, non-seizable, non-inflatable, or non-debaseable asset. And when you go looking for it, you’ll find bitcoin. I believe bitcoin’s best ally is just time. And as more people get put in situations where it could be valuable to them, they will opt in.

What have you learned from all the time you’ve been investing in digital assets?

There are three big things. One: This time is not different. All of the traditional investment lessons are true here as well – don’t be emotional, have a long time preference, dollar-cost averaging – all of that remains true regardless of the asset. Second, be comfortable with non-consensus opinions. In 2016, 2017 we were public about being negative on the ICO market, and that turned out to be the right bet. Lastly, and this comes from someone who is incredibly bullish, I’m probably underestimating how big this is. That’s not specifically true for bitcoin, but for the entire industry. Who would have thought in 1985 that the internet would become what it is today? Even the biggest bulls couldn’t have seen it. I think we generally underestimate what’s possible over a long period of time.

Speaking of not seeing things in perspective, was there anything that happened over the past year that completely took you by surprise?

The whole Libra situation in general. That they moved so quickly to announce it. The backlash against them. And two, the institutional adoption. We all thought that it was going to come, but the pace at which a lot of these institutions are coming to bitcoin and blockchain is pretty incredible.

What do we overlook in the media as far as this industry?","The bitcoin payments startup Bottle Pay shut down on Friday, citing the AMLD5 European Union regulation coming into effect Jan. 10, 2020.

The Bottle Pay app once allowed users to send tiny amounts of bitcoin using just social media texts and handles, from Twitter to Telegram. There are roughly 974 members in the project’s Telegram group.

The London-based company raised $2 million in September, The Block reported at the time. Back in December, the team declined to name any of the investors but said the startup already served 10,000 user accounts.

Bottle Pay finally released a public beta with real bitcoin in late November, and just now realized new European regulations would dramatically alter the company’s roadmap.

“The amount and type of extra personal information we would be required to collect from our users would alter the current user experience so radically, and so negatively, that we are not willing to force this onto our community,” the company said in a statement, adding the team never charged for this service, added routing fees or sold anything to users.

First of many?

Bottle Pay won’t be the only British crypto startup impacted by the regulations, which require a strict user verification process. Similarly, the exchange Bitpanda announced on Friday it will roll out a new user registration process. Jon Matonis, chief economist at Canada’s Cypherpunk Holdings Inc., tweeted this policy applies to custodial crypto wallets.

The privacy-focused wallet Samourai Wallet, which isn’t publicly registered in any specific jurisdiction, tweeted earlier this year the team believes this policy also applies to noncustodial wallets (though they said they would not comply with it).

Teana Baker-Taylor, a London-based compliance expert and director of crypto industry group Global Digital Finance, said this policy could force all crypto wallet providers in the European Union to collect know-your-customer information from users.

In reference to cryptocurrency exchanges and custodial wallets, she said they will become “obliged entities,” similar to banks and other brokerage service providers.

“AMLD5 prohibits facilitated (non peer-to-peer) anonymous transactions,” Baker-Taylor told CoinDesk. “Custodian wallet providers and exchanges will be obligated to implement customer due diligence (including KYC) and transaction monitoring. They will also be required to maintain comprehensive records and report suspicious transactions.”

Speaking broadly in June to the need for more regulation in the global cryptocurrency industry, Steven Maijoor of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said it’s “important to have risk warnings [and] risk information for consumers going into those products” – including anti-money-laundering procedures and arrangements.

When asked how specifically that policy should apply Maijoor said deferred to the expertise of the European Banking Authority.

In the meantime, Bottle Pay tweeted that all users should withdraw their funds within the next two weeks.","A judge of the United States district court in California has dismissed the lawsuit brought against crypto derivative exchange FTX for market manipulation and the sale of unlicensed securities in the US.

“Defendant Alameda Research LLC’s motion to dismiss Bitcoin Manipulation Abatement LLC’s Amended Complaint (the “Amended Complaint”) in the above-captioned action came on regularly for hearing before the Court on February 13, 2020,” the court order published on Thursday stated.

“After considering the papers submitted by the parties and the argument of counsel, the Court finds that plaintiff has failed to comply with the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) or 8(a)(2), and that dismissal is warranted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).”

A lawsuit with no strong grounds

The complaint also alleged that the FTX official ran unlicensed money transmitting business with its OTC desk and also accused the exchange of attempting an attack on Binance.

“Accordingly, Alameda Research LLC’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and the Amended Complaint is dismissed in its entirety with PREJUDICE,” the court order added.

Bitcoin risks revisiting Thursday's low of $7,072, having charted a shallow bounce in the last 24 hours.

The three-day chart indicates scope for a deeper drop toward recent lows near $6,500.

A climb to $7,400 cannot be ruled out if the newfound hourly chart resistance at $7,250 is breached with high volumes in the next few hours.

The outlook will remain bearish as long as the lower high at $7,870 is intact.

Bitcoin is again looking weak, having charted a shallow bounce from two-week lows in the last 24 hours.

The cryptocurrency looked to have had potential to jump above $7,300 and possibly extend gains toward $7,500. After all, credible signs of seller exhaustion had emerged on the intraday technical charts following Thursday’s drop to $7,072 – the lowest level since Nov. 24.

So far, however, the rebound has been anything but impressive. Bitcoin has faced rejection around $7,250 two times in the last 12 hours and is changing hands at around $7,200 on Bitstamp at press time.

The lackluster bounce indicates sentiment is still quite bearish. In fact, the intraday charts have now rolled back in favor of the sellers. Further, fresh bearish signs have emerged on longer durations, too, indicating scope for a slide to recent lows.

Hourly chart

The ascending channel breakdown seen on the hourly chart indicates the bounce from two-week lows has fizzled out and a fresh drop toward $7,072 and possibly to $7,000 may be in the offing.

The bearish case would strengthen further if the RSI violates the ascending trendline.

A convincing move above $7,250 could propel prices on to $7,400. That said, the outlook will remain bearish as long as prices are trading below the lower high of $7,870 created on Nov. 29.

3-day chart

Bitcoin created a bearish “outside bar” candlestick pattern in the three days to Dec. 11. Widely considered a sign of an impending sell-off, these candles occur when the period begins on a positive note but ends with pessimism, engulfing the preceding day’s price action.","Binance has teamed up with peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange, Paxful, to open up new ways of purchase bitcoin on its platform.

The group’s members convinced investors to join a cryptocurrency investment club by promising them huge returns. Meanwhile, in private, they were calling their investors “sheep” and “idiots”, the prosecutors investigating the case said, according to the New York Times.

The scheme was called BitClub Network and promoted itself as “the most transparent company in the history of the world” and “too big to fail.” The people running the network in the US asked investors to join and share the profits they claimed it made from Bitcoin mining operations. They said they used the money drawn from investors to buy equipment for cryptocurrency mining, when only a small amount of money went into that.

Three of the defendants, all of them American citizens, were arrested in the US and a fourth member of the group, a Romanian national, was arrested in Germany, while the fifth defendant, whose identity was not made public, is still at large, the US attorney’s office announced on Wednesday.

“Those arrested today are accused of deploying elaborate tactics to lure thousands of victims with promises of large returns on their investments in a bitcoin mining pool, an advanced method of profiting on cryptocurrency,” Paul Delacourt, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office said in a press release. “The defendants allegedly made hundreds of millions of dollars by continuing to recruit new investors over several years while spending victims' money lavishly.”

While the Americans were involved in promoting the scheme and drawing investors in the US, the Romanian was apparently involved in the operational part, namely setting up the actual Bitcoin mining operations and supplying the other members with technical presentations and false activity reports.

“Bump up the daily mining earnings starting today by 60%,” one of the defendants told the Romanian co-conspirator in an online conversation, in February 2015. “60%? Wow! That is not sustainable, that is Ponzi territory and fast cash-out Ponzi. But sure,” the Romanian answered, according to information included in the Indictment the attorney filed in court.

The Romanian member of this scheme, whose name can be found in the documents released by the US prosecutors, presents himself as the owner of a Romanian IT company in Resita, which operates data centers for cryptocurrency mining. He also works as CTO of a cryptocurrency company in Germany, according to his LinkedIn profile.

The Romanian was arrested in Germany after the US prosecutors announced the indictment of his partners in the US and an extradition process has been initiated. He faces a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud conspiracy charge, and a fine of up to USD 250,000, if found guilty.

2019-12-14,"If the client demand is there, then Fidelity Digital Assets could support Ethereum in 2020.

In a recent episode of The Scoop, the venture's president Tom Jessop told The Block that the firm has ""done a lot of work on Ethereum"" when asked if they would soon offer custody for the digital currency. Launched at the beginning of 2019, Fidelity Digital Assets (FDAS) offers cryptocurrency custody and trading tools for institutional investors and traders. Still, the firm has only supported bitcoin — a fact that some say keeps FDAS from truly competing with crypto-native firms like Coinbase and BitGo.

Jessop said that the lack of a track-record serves as one of the biggest obstacles to institutional adoption of a given cryptocurrency. Since bitcoin has the longest track record, there is a stronger appetite from institutional investors to allocate capital to it compared to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, according to Jessop. Hence the reason Fidelity isn't supporting it, at the moment.

""How do I know that if I buy this thing, it's gonna be around tomorrow? Like what indication of durability or longevity do I have based on the fact that the history of this asset is 10 years old?"" said Jessop.

In November, FDAS obtained a trust license from New York regulators to offer custody services to clients in the state. The firm was also selected by Galaxy Digital to offer third party custody for its two new bitcoin funds.","Share this article

Metal wallets are a reliable way to store Bitcoin for a long period of time. These wallets are simple metal plates that hold a seed phrase – a string of words that can be used to recover a Bitcoin address. Typically, metal wallets are used to back up deposit-only addresses that have never been used for payments. Additionally, they can be used to back up active Bitcoin addresses as well. ⁠

Most metal wallets share the same basic qualities: they’re designed to withstand fires, floods, extreme pressure, and other harsh conditions. However, not all metal wallets are designed equally. Some are much more durable than others. Some provide better protection against tampering, or feature greater simplicity. With that in mind, here are ten of the best metal wallets on the market today.

Best Engravable Plate: Crypto Key Stack

It’s hard to go wrong with engravable (or stampable) metal plates, as they have no component parts that can be destroyed or displaced. Crypto Key Stack is one of the best wallets in this category: Jameson Lopp, the CTO of CasaHODL, tested the product and found that its engravings are highly legible even after damage. It is affordable as well: Crypto Key Stack’s $45 price tag includes an engraving tool and a 12-word metal plate.

Best Grid Plates: Blockplate and Steelwallet

Grid plates represent seed words in a different way. Each letter is represented by a punched hole instead of a written letter. This system is not easy to read at a glance, but it makes it hard to confuse one word for another. Lopp’s tests have found that both Blockplate and Steelwallet are quite damage-resistant. Both companies charge about $65 for two 12-word plates that provide room for 24 seed words.

Best Metal Rod: Coldbit Passphrase

Metal rods are another variation on engravable wallets. Coldbit Passphrase is one highly affordable wallet of this type. Each rod is approximately $20 and provides enough space for 24-36 words. Coldbit stamp sets cost extra, but any stamp set or engraving tool should work. Lopp’s tests demonstrated that Coldbit Passphrase is very resistant to fire and pressure. However, he did note that the product is vulnerable to corrosion.

Best Keychain: Crypto Keys

Crypto Keys offers an engravable wallet with a unique look: each small plate resembles a “key” and is designed to hold two words. Since this design uses space efficiently, the product is quite affordable. A $28 set includes thirteen double-sided “keys” with room for 24 words, plus a stamp set. A with most other engravable metal plates, Crypto Keys held up extremely well during testing.

Best Insertable Tile Wallet: Simbit

Some metal wallets are not engravable. Instead, they rely on a rail system to hold insertable letter tiles in place. This design, however, does not hold up well during testing. Testing revealed that fire and pressure tend to cause the letters to fall out of place. Lopp did note one exception: the Simbit wallet held up exceptionally well. The $110 product offers enough space for a 24-word passphrase.

Best Capsule Wallet: Quadrat Register

Capsule wallets use stacked tiles to keep their contents in order. This can be a very durable design. Lopp found that Quadrat Register held up better than nearly all other metal wallets. Unfortunately, Quadrat Register is expensive – it costs approximately $330, plus $155 for a protective capsule. This device uses a complicated dot-code system to represent seed words, which is not particularly user-friendly.

Best Tamper-proof Wallet: CypherWheel

Few hardware wallets offer tamper-proof features, and those that do typically make use of basic seals and envelopes. CypherWheel goes one step further. It’s tamper-proof design includes a seal with a security number and the device can be locked with a padlock. Internally, CypherWheel uses slotted insertable tiles. The $200 product held up fairly well during Lopp’s tests, though it was somewhat susceptible to corrosion.

Best Prefab Wallet: Bitkee

Some manufacturers print wallet details directly on their product. Bitkee sells a $40 customizable metal plate featuring laser-engraved private keys, public keys, QR codes, and a logo of your choice. Bitkee’s order form also supports encrypted private keys, which prevent the company from accessing your funds. Like most metal plates, Bitkee is highly resistant to damage, according to test results.

Best Physical Coin: Denarium

Physical Bitcoins, though they are made of metal, are not made to last. Lopp has shown that at least one brand became illegible during testing. However, Denarium coins are a decent choice. Though they do not claim to be durable, they provide redundancy: each coin includes an internal private key, which is duplicated in a QR code. Denarium also offers multisig to prevent the company from accessing your funds. Prices begin at approximately $26.

Best DIY Material: 316L Stainless Steel

It is possible to simply buy a plate of metal and engrave it yourself. Bulletproof Bitcoin suggests that users “order a simple stainless steel or titanium plate from eBay and punch it.” Though titanium has a slightly higher melting point, 316L stainless steel is several times cheaper, making it a good option for investors on a budget.

Other Considerations

Metal wallet testing is usually far more intense than any realistic scenario. Lopp subjected metal wallets to temperatures above 2000°F, highly corrosive acid, and direct pressure. Realistically, metal wallets might face 1100°F house fires, moisture and humidity, and possibly damage from building debris.

This means that it is not a good idea to focus on durability to the point of ignoring security threats. Most metal wallets cannot prevent other people from accessing your cryptocurrency. If you lose your wallet, you should move your funds to a new wallet address immediately. Similarly, it is extremely easy to lose small metal wallets, so it is a good idea to keep secondary backups as well.

Finally, compatibility is important. Usually, it is impossible to retrieve a seed phrase if your funds are stored on an exchange. You will need to withdraw your funds to a software wallet or hardware wallet, generate your seed phrase, then engrave it on your metal wallet. You can find wallets that support various standards here – and making a note of your choice will make it easier to restore your funds in the future.

If you intend to hold a sizeable stash of Bitcoin for the ages, then an investment in a doomsday wallet is warranted.

Interest-bearing crypto saving accounts have become a popular new investment vehicle for digital asset investors who want to earn interest while HODLing.

In this article, we will take a quick look into the basics of the crypto saving account market.

What is a crypto savings account?

A crypto savings account is effectively the same as a savings account that you would open at your local retail bank, where you deposit cash - usually for a specific time period - in exchange for better interest rates than you are receiving on your current account. The difference, however, is that you are depositing cryptocurrency and are earning interest in cryptocurrency.

When bitcoin (BTC) savings accounts first appeared several years ago, the initial reaction by the community was to shout “scam!” At the time, bitcoin savings accounts were offered by small startups that lacked trust and the level of financial backing needed to provide this type of financial service.

In 2019, things are a little different. Today, you can deposit bitcoin (and other digital assets) into savings accounts managed by legitimate blockchain companies and will - with relative certainty - receive your deposited funds back with interest.

Crypto savings account providers can afford to pay interest on bitcoin (and other assets) by lending your coins for a higher rate than what they are paying you in interest. In that sense, crypto savings account platforms function in the same way as banks.

Top crypto savings account providers

You can earn interest on your cryptoasset holdings through a number of ways, such as lending to margin traders on exchanges, funding peer-to-peer loans or staking Proof of stake coins.

In this section, we will focus exclusively on providers that offer crypto savings accounts that only involve you depositing funds to start earning interest.

In today’s market, some of the popular crypto savings account providers that enable you to earn interest on bitcoin (and in some cases altcoins) include:

BlockFi

BTCPop

Crypto.com

Nebeus

YouHODLer

BlockFi is a market-leading digital asset wealth management services provider that enables investors to earn “0.5%-8.6%” annual percentage yield (APY) on their cryptoasset holdings. Currently, the New York-based non-bank lender enables crypto investors to deposit BTC, ETH or GUSD to earn interest through its “Crypto Interest Accounts.” No minimum deposit is required, which makes it accessible to anyone (except in sanctioned or watchlist countries, and New York and Connecticut) with an Internet connection and crypto holdings.

BTCPop is one of the oldest in the crypto lending space that has been around since 2014. Originally, BTCPop launched as a bitcoin peer-to-peer lending platform but during its five-year history it has evolved into a full-service cryptocurrency investment services provider that enables users to buy, sell, borrow, lend, save, and stake cryptoassets. As part of its offering, BTCPop provides an Instant Savings Account that enables investors to earn daily interest on deposited BTC. The interest rates fluctuate and there is no annual percentage rate that the provider guarantees depositors.

Crypto.com is a digital asset investment platform and exchange that enables users to make use of a wide range of crypto-related products and services, including a savings account called “Crypto Earn.” By depositing cryptocurrencies in a Crypto Earn savings account at Crypto.com, you can in theory earn up to 12%, although rates vary from asset to asset.

Nebeus is a London-based cryptocurrency lending platform that enables investors to deposit BTC or ETH to earn a fixed interest rate of 8.45% p.a. interest is paid monthly and the savings terms range from 3 to 36 months. The platform requires a minimum deposit of the crypto-equivalent of EUR 100 and pays interest in either crypto or fiat currency.

YouHODLer is a crypto lending platform that also enables investors to earn interest on their cryptoassets simply by depositing them into their YouHODLer wallet. The Cyprus-based platform pays interest - either in crypto or fiat currency - monthly and enables you to deposit a range of assets, including BTC, BNB, USDT and a number of other stablecoins. Interest rates vary from as low as 3% on BNB to up to 12% on stablecoins and there is no minimum deposit requirement.

What interest rates can you expect?

Interest rates offered by crypto savings accounts providers differ from platform to platform and from asset to asset. Below, you can find an overview of the annual percentage yields you can expect from each listed provider.

Provider Supported Assets Expected APY BlockFi BTC, ETH, GUSD Up to 8.6%* BTCPop BTC ~5%* Crypto.com BTC, ETH, BNB, BAT, USDT, USDC up to 12%* Nebeus BTC, ETH 8.45%* YouHODLer BTC, BNB, USDT, USDC, PAX, TUSD Up to 12%*

*Actual APYs may vary.

However, for example in the case of BlocFi, actual yield will vary based on account activity and compliance with BlockFi’s terms and conditions. “Rates are largely dictated by market conditions, which are a key factor in a company’s ability to provide its clients yield on their crypto assets,” the company warns, stressing that it will communicate any rate changes prior to these changes taking effect.

Also, you need to take into account that withdrawal fees and limitations might be applied.

Are they safe?

The old crypto adage “not your key, not your coins” hold true in any situation. Whether you are holding coins on a centralized exchange, at a peer-to-peer lender or in a saving account, there is always the risk that you could lose your funds because you don’t hold the private keys for them. (Learn more: Private Keys or Compound Interest? A New Crypto Debate)

Moreover, it is not a bank account nor a brokerage account, and is not subject to traditional protections that a traditional bank client can enjoy. (But they also “enjoy” 0% interest rate in many cases).

As a result, there is a certain level of risk involved in earning interest on your bitcoin holdings using crypto savings accounts. It is up to you as an investor to decide whether the annual percentage yields offered are worth the risks involved.","This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Andy Bromberg is the co-founder and president of CoinList, a platform for token sales. CoinList is also launching a cryptocurrency exchange, and provides compliance and developer engagement services to crypto projects.

Compared to the 2017-18 hype cycle, this was a quiet year for the crypto markets. There was no tidal wave of institutional money or cascade of mass adoption. Regulators gave encouraging crypto guidance while also putting Libra and projects like Kik and Telegram in their crosshairs. And for our business and the larger token sale space, we continued to see investors eager to back quality projects.

In other words, the crypto experiment continued.

In 2019, we saw startups tweak token-based fundraising models in new directions. For instance, Algorand ran a Dutch Auction sale on our platform where participants set and paid a uniform, market-determined price per token to ensure fairness and transparency – some of the core tenets of the project. There were projects like Blockstack that were the first to conduct a Reg A+ token sale. And, we saw projects starting to conduct Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) in order to provide immediate liquidity for investors.

Public sales are increasingly used primarily as a mechanism to distribute tokens.

In other words, token sales survived the crypto winter. In 2017 and early 2018, public token sales were focused on raising large chunks of capital for projects. But based on what we’re seeing today, public sales are increasingly used primarily as a mechanism to distribute tokens to a broad array of stakeholders, with the capital raise being a secondary consideration.

But a lot of the continued viability of crypto projects and token sales alike hinges on the SEC and other regulators.

The crypto community got some mixed messages from DC in 2019. The government went after Libra, fined EOS, filed a lawsuit against Kik, and blocked Telegram from distributing its token. Some members of government were more supportive of crypto – including SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who called for a safe harbor for crypto projects, so tokens meeting specified criteria could be traded more freely, enabling a more open crypto ecosystem. As we approach the new decade, this – and other encouraging signals — give me confidence in the long-term viability and success of token sales.

What does that mean for 2020?

Just as our industry matures and projects experiment with different token sale mechanisms, we’ll see many live network launches – including many projects that raised money on our platform. These live networks will be a proving ground for even more novel crypto ideas.

On the institutional side, don’t expect to see a “wave” of new money come crashing in, but building off of 2019, we expect a gradual, slow-rising tide of institutional capital.

Finally, we’ll continue to see the industry working with the SEC and other regulators to provide clarity, with the aim of avoiding any more companies receiving punishments of the sort meted out this year.","This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Halsey Minor started CNET, and was involved in a string of companies. Today he leads Live Planet VR and the VideoCoin Network, video infrastructure for the blockchain-enabled internet.

I started in the crypto industry in 2013 launching Uphold, the payment service and exchange that created one of the first stablecoins. It still allows users to buy and trade bitcoin and 15 fiat currencies today. At the time, Coinbase required traders to sell bitcoin and send the money back to their bank accounts. It had no USD service. We wanted to give traders the ability to convert bitcoin to their native fiat currencies and back again without leaving the ecosystem and to send funds all the way back to their banks. Back then, holding fiat “stablecoins” on a service like ours was not well liked in a bitcoin-or-nothing world.

In 2019, as traders sought more pricing stability, we saw the rise of Tether and its many competitors. Stablecoins have become the solution to move fiat among exchanges without using banks directly. Fiat trading on blockchain has exploded and US dollar-backed stablecoins have attracted more than $4.5 billion of investment. What this proves is that fiat and crypto were never enemies. They were complementary in any effective trading ecosystem, and both have prospered.

For convenience, crypto-users need to be able to use their bank accounts to pay for products and services. If, instead, you force them to open an exchange account and to use some new, volatile form of money with low liquidity just to use your service – then you’ve created significant friction. If blockchain-based businesses are to succeed, they must be as convenient to use as non-blockchain services.

At VideoCoin, a company building a decentralized video infrastructure platform, we asked ourselves a simple question. If Paramount Pictures or 20th Century Fox were a VideoCoin customer and they wanted to spend $100,000 a month on our video encoding service, would they be willing to open an exchange account, hire a trader to avoid driving the price up at acquisition, and then deposit funds whose value on our services would fluctuate every minute of every day? You see the problem, here.

Our competitors at Amazon Web Services let customers use a regular bank account in all its forms – credit card, wire transfer, ACH, and so on. These methods are simple to use and the value they deposit does not fluctuate significantly from moment to moment. Even though we are building a service that is dramatically lower priced, the payment friction would be so great it would substantially hurt our ability to compete.

We collaborated with a third-party (which we’ve yet to announce) to create a fiat-based blockchain connected to banks. This provides access to traditional payment methods like credit cards and ACH while keeping all of the inherent benefits of blockchain. Even the gas – the fuel necessary to do any transaction on a blockchain network – is fiat-based creating the first tokenized fiat blockchain supporting smart contracts and traditional payment methods. This model allows 20th Century Fox to pay in dollars and our workers (data centers) to be compensated in dollars upon completion of verified work. No friction, just lower cost.

Tokens used as payments are not competitive with fiat when it comes to reaching customers outside of the crypto ecosystem. Unfortunately, almost all of the business world today lives outside of the crypto ecosystem and they do not have access to crypto exchanges, but they do have credit cards. We need to make VideoCoin as easy to use as any other competitive service, if not easier.

Embracing fiat payments is not capitulation, it’s the first step toward making the businesses we envision real.

At VideoCoin, our utility token VID plays an incredibly useful function in securing and powering the network, ensuring the most qualified network operators are serving customer needs. The VID token does not act as a payment mechanism. Instead, it’s a reputational staking mechanism for building the global infrastructure that runs the worker nodes on the VideoCoin Network. Miners are continuously selected by the VideoCoin Network services algorithm as operators to process video files based on three factors: quoted price, number of staked tokens, and performance. This drives the least expensive and highest quality network operators to perform—the best rise to the top. Staking is the perfect use for tokens in a utility model. Instead of burdening the network with payment friction, our tokens power the network to function securely and in return, workers receive staking rewards in fiat.

This means customers of the VideoCoin Network pay in fiat, the data centers get paid in fiat, and those staking are paid in fiat plus a small staking reward in VID tokens. Reward tokens are automatically purchased by the Network from exchanges, at the then-prevailing price, when a job is started so stakers end up with fiat they can send to their bank and a small additional amount in tokens.

Just as Tether, Paxos Standard and other stablecoins have made it easier to use exchanges, trade and move money into and out of the banking system, so too can a fiat-integrated blockchain liberate crypto from payment friction, which is a business killer. If crypto startups want to take market share from traditional businesses, they need to allow for the convenience of fiat-based payments.","Jesus Rodriguez is the CTO and co-founder of IntoTheBlock, a platform focused on enabling an intelligent infrastructure for the crypto markets, as well as chief scientist of AI firm Invector Labs and an active investor, speaker and author in crypto and artificial intelligence. This article originally appeared in CoinDesk’s Institutional Crypto newsletter.

One of the established beliefs in the cryptocurrency market is its susceptibility to news and social media. Like any other nascent and still irrational financial market, unexpected developments captured in news or social media tend to impact price. As a result, there is increasing interest in leveraging machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis to detect possible correlations with the price of cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. Despite its importance, most attempts to leverage sentiment analysis are too basic to output any tangible intelligence and quite often produce misleading results.

The challenges of efficiently leveraging sentiment analysis to evaluate the behavior of an asset are not unique to the crypto space. Producing true insights based on textual sentiment is a very difficult task that, most of the time, requires natural language processing (NLP) models optimized for a specific financial domain. Large quantitative hedge funds use armies of machine learning experts to train NLP models in a very specific task like analyzing earning reports in order to get an edge in a medium frequency trade. Efficiently leveraging sentiment analysis for crypto assets requires machine learning depth and rigor.

To understand that statement, let’s start by diving a bit deeper into the characteristics of sentiment analysis methods.

A gentle introduction to sentiment analysis

In Act II, Scene II of the famous play Richelieu; Or the Conspiracy, British playwright Edward Bulwer-Lytton coined a phrase that has transcended generations: “The pen is mightier than the sword.” Centuries after, that famous quote brilliantly encapsulates the importance of sentiment analysis. Emotions in textual communication are sometimes more conducive to actions than physical actions themselves.

Conceptually, sentiment analysis is a subdiscipline of NLP that focuses on identifying the affective states of textual communications. Contrary to popular beliefs, sentiment analysis is not a single technique but rather a subdiscipline of the deep learning space that covers different types of affection detection in textual data. From that perspective, there are several types of sentiment analysis that could be relevant in the context of crypto-asset intelligence:

Polarity Analysis : This type of sentiment analysis ranks textual sentiment in positive, negative and neutral. For instance, the sentence “the bitcoin price rally has reenergized the market” would likely be classified as positive by most models.

: This type of sentiment analysis ranks textual sentiment in positive, negative and neutral. For instance, the sentence “the bitcoin price rally has reenergized the market” would likely be classified as positive by most models. Emotion/Tone Analysis : Instead of an overall qualifier for the text, this type of analysis centers on scoring the different types of emotions present in a particular text. Emotions such as sadness, happiness or anger are a common focus of emotion analysis algorithms. For instance, the sentence “this bitcoin rally is crazy,” will show high levels of excitement and joy.

: Instead of an overall qualifier for the text, this type of analysis centers on scoring the different types of emotions present in a particular text. Emotions such as sadness, happiness or anger are a common focus of emotion analysis algorithms. For instance, the sentence “this bitcoin rally is crazy,” will show high levels of excitement and joy. Aspect Sentiment Analysis: This type of sentiment analysis focuses on interpreting the sentiment about specific subjects within a sentence rather than a sentence as a whole. For instance, in the sentence “Bakkt futures are a major milestone for the bitcoin market,” aspect analysis will determine the sentiment related to “Bakkt futures” instead of the complete sentence.

Looking at the previous list, we can clearly see the benefits of sentiment analysis for crypto assets. However, there are also plenty of challenges that should be considered before venturing into using these types of techniques. Contextualization, subjectivity, irony or even bad grammar are among the factors that can easily trick the best NLP algorithms.

Sentiment analysis for crypto assets

Crypto is a nascent asset class that is still vulnerable to the irrationality of financial markets and the lack of proper disclosure channels. From that perspective, it is only logical to assume NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis can identify alpha or smart beta generator factors to predict the behavior of crypto assets. Reality is a bit different.

When applying sentiment analysis to crypto assets, we are likely to encounter two main types of challenges:

Limitations of mainstream NLP technologies when applied to a domain-specific problem such as crypto asset analysis. Incorrect assumptions about how sentiment is reflected in news and social media.

The first challenge can almost be seen as an unexpected side effect of the rapid growth of NLP technologies. Today, it is relatively easy for a developer to incorporate sentiment analysis into applications using simple APIs that don’t require any deep learning expertise.

While NLP APIs can be effective analyzing the sentiment of a generic sentence, they perform extremely poorly when trying to extrapolate domain-specific knowledge of a specific sentence. For instance, analyzing the sentence “a bitcoin ETF approval could be imminent” requires NLP models that are specialized in the semantics of market-specific terminology and that are able to extrapolate sentiment at a more granular level than from just a sentence.

The second challenge is related to misconceptions about how sentiment is reflected in news and social media commentary. As a source of intelligence, news can be highly informative but quite useless when comes to sentiment analysis. The reason is obvious: the sentiment in well-written news should trend around neutral. Social media behaves in the exact opposite way. Conversations about cryptocurrencies in Twitter or Telegram tend to contain relevant sentiment but, for the most part, are based on a reaction to public material information, which means that they are unlikely to generate any informational edge. Additionally, social media threads tend to be noisy and relatively subjective, which can produce misleading sentiment analysis results.

From a purely technological standpoint, building effective sentiment analysis models for crypto assets requires models trained in the terminology of crypto markets, but that also analyze news as sources of information and social media feeds as amplifiers of sentiment. However, if we get past this technological challenge, we are now faced with one of the biggest psychological misconceptions when comes to sentiment analysis models in the crypto space.

The sentiment-market impact fallacy

The sentiment-market impact fallacy describes a phenomenon that is notorious or irrational, such as nascent financial markets in which investors assume a direct correlation between a sentiment score and a price movement. To explain this behavioral economics dynamic, let’s imagine that you are using an analytics tool that analyze the sentiment of recent bitcoin tweets. Psychologically, most investors are inclined to interpret the sentiment as a leading indicator based on the following rules:

If the sentiment is positive that’s a bullish indicator for the price of bitcoin.

If the sentiment is negative that’s a bearish indicator for the price of bitcoin.

However, if your model is analyzing public, material information, the sentiment should be interpreted as a lagging indicator following some non-intuitive rules:

If the sentiment is positive and the price of bitcoin does not go up, that is a bearish signal.

If the sentiment is negative and the price of bitcoin does not go down, that is a bullish signal.

Being aware of sentiment-price bias positions sentiment analysis not as a leading indicator but as an often relevant factor in a trading strategy.

From sentiment analysis to market impact analysis

From an informational standpoint, the crypto market is noisy and full of unexpected events. In terms of sentiment analysis, that combination of factors is a nightmare. Instead of narrowly focusing on sentiment analysis, we should probably develop a more holistic approach. A sentiment-market impact indicator would be a combination of polarity (negative, positive, neutral), emotion (anxious, excited, sad…) and aspect-based (topics, entities…) analysis over long periods of time. This approach would require the training of models specialized in the dynamics of crypto assets to evaluate the sentiment in the context of specific market conditions.

The idea of sentiment-market impact models is conceptually trivial: quantify the impact that combinations of sentiment, emotions and topics can have on a crypto asset during specific market conditions. Part of the beauty of this approach is that it doesn’t have to be completely unsupervised like most sentiment models today; it can be trained on domain-specific knowledge of crypto markets. For instance, we could train a model to learn that positive articles about Chinese investment in crypto can have a positive impact in a market that had been relatively bearish for the last week. The core principle of sentiment-market impact analysis models would be to contextualize the knowledge of sentiment models to the specifics of the crypto market.","As discussed in a previous article on bullish candlestick patterns, trading using Japanese candlesticks is the most popular method for analyzing price action by crypto traders.

There are many patterns worth learning and understanding — some of the most essential bearish patterns are discussed below. It is important to note, once again, that context and candle placement are essential in identifying patterns.

The same exact candlestick can be bullish when located in a different place on the chart.

Bearish Harami

The Bearish Harami is a two candle pattern that signals a likely reversal in price. In this pattern, the first candle is large and green and is followed by a red candle with a smaller body.

To be valid, the second candle must be completely within the range of the body of the first candle. Another notable version of this pattern is the Bearish Harami Cross, where the second candle is a perfect doji.

In Japanese, the term “Harami” is the word for pregnant. In this pattern, the green candlestick is the “mother” and the small candlestick is the “baby.”

Dark Cloud Cover

Price action following this pattern is often as ominous as its name, Dark Cloud Cover. This is another 2 candle pattern that signals a likely bearish reversal at the top of a bullish movement. The first candle is generally large, always green, and is followed by a similar red candle.

The second candle opens with a gap up to a fresh high but closes the session more than halfway into the body of the first day’s candle. This is a signal that bears have dominated the session, pushing the price down with the intention of following through on future candles.

The Evening Star

The Evening Star is a bearish reversal pattern that appears at the top of an uptrend with a large bullish candle, followed by a gap up to a small-bodied candle and a gap down to a red candle that closes below the midpoint of the first day.

The first candlestick in the evening star must be green and have a relatively large real body. The second candlestick is the star, which has a short real body that does not touch the real body of the first candle — it is the gap between the real bodies of the two candlesticks that makes a doji or a spinning top qualify as an evening star.

This pattern is confirmed by the candlestick that follows the star, which must be a red candle that closes well into the body of the first candlestick.

In legacy markets, there must be gaps between each of the candles. However, since crypto trades 24/7 and gaps are rare, some technical analysts argue that this pattern is still valid without the gaps.

Shooting Star

Similar to the previously discussed patterns, the shooting star is a bearish reversal pattern. This two candle pattern appears during an uptrend and signals an upcoming reversal to a bearish bias.

The first candle is green, followed by a green or red candle that has a long upper wick and small body. The second candle looks like an inverted hammer, which is bullish when located at the bottom of a trend.

The long wick as an indication that bulls controlled much of the session, before losing ground to bears, who pushed the price back down to close near the daily open. This is a signal that price depreciation is likely and is confirmed when followed by a bearish candle.

Hanging Man

The Hanging Man is a single candle pattern that indicates a likely reversal from bullish price action to bearish price action. This candle has a long lower shadow and a small body and appears at the top of a trend or during an uptrend.

Once again, when this candle is at the bottom of a downtrend, it is called a hammer and signals a bullish reversal — context matters. This candle shows that sellers were able to take control during a portion of the period. It indicates that bears defended the current price and are likely to continue selling through the subsequent candle.

Get to know these candlestick patterns — they are essential to understand as a crypto trader!

On December 3, the crypto software firm Bloxroute’s cofounder, Eyal Markovich, announced the launch of the startup’s Blockchain Distribution Network (BDN) Version 1. Markovich explained that the BDN V1 release is a milestone for the company and the scalability service aims to enable exponential blockchain scaling by propagating blocks and transactions faster.

The Blockchain Distribution Network Version 1

The startup Bloxroute, a firm dedicated to blockchain propagation software, recently revealed the launch of BDN V1. The protocol is a “Layer-0 blockchain scalability solution” and Bloxroute’s Markovich detailed that developers have been working “tirelessly” toward the effort. News.Bitcoin.com first reported on Bloxroute back in November 2018, after the Bitcoin Cash blockchain split. After BSV split off from the BCH network, both communities heavily debated how miners and nodes would handle massive sized blocks in the future. At the time, Bloxroute was brought up in these debates quite a bit, because the startup claims the BDN can provide more efficient block propagation for blockchains.

“In particular, Bloxroute propagates blocks without knowledge of the transactions they contain, their number, and the ‘wallets’ or addresses involved. Miners are free to include arbitrary transactions in a block,” the Bloxroute whitepaper explains.

Since then Bloxroute has been experimenting with multiple blockchains and recent tests include the ETH Mining Test, Bitcoin Cash Miner Test, and the Akomba Labs Test. The results from the Bitcoin Cash Miner Test, in particular, had shown that “BDN propagates large blocks (32MB) between 2-18 seconds compared to up to 193 seconds without Bloxroute.”

“Block compression technology, such as Compact blocks, improved with the BDN as transaction propagation allowed mempools to be more in sync,” the report highlights. Additionally, China saw the “largest improvement” in propagation times and BDN “sped up fork recoveries,” like missed transactions from compact blocks. Bloxroute has been working with mining pools as well and news.Bitcoin.com reported about one partnership last January when the firm partnered with the mining operation Rawpool.

‘Any Blockchain Project Can Integrate With Bloxroute’

For the latest BDN V1 Gateway software, Markovich details that the protocol is available via Github, Dockerhub, and Pypi. Markovich also notes that Bloxroute expects to see exchanges, decentralized apps, and mining pools adopt BDN V1. People can get a comprehensive overview of the architecture, components, and installation walkthroughs by visiting Bloxroute’s documentation page.

“Later this year, we will publish a more technical post on the content of V1 and on the BDN roadmap for 2020,” Markovich said. Additionally, Bloxroute’s website shows a list of blockchain partners who plan to leverage the BDN software. Bloxroute is also backed by investment firms such as Pantera, Coinbase Ventures, Fenbushi, and well known individuals like Fred Ehrsam, and Jack Herrick. In addition to detailing that a technical post and BDN roadmap was in the works, Markovich’s blog post emphasized that “any blockchain project can integrate with Bloxroute.”

“While the first version of the Blockchain Distribution Network (BDN) supports Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, we are also working to integrate the BDN with a number of new blockchain projects including Ontology, Quorum, Conflux, and Metadium,” Markovich added.

The committee, a unit of the Bank for International Settlements, has published a discussion paper, saying that the growth of cryptocurrencies and related services could pose risks to financial stability and banks, and therefore, a “conservative prudential” treatment to cryptocurrency exposures should be applied.

“If banks are authorized, and decide, to acquire crypto-assets or provide related services, the Committee is of the view that they should apply a conservative prudential treatment to such exposures, especially for high-risk crypto-assets,” it said.

Exposure to cryptocurrencies could be direct (direct holdings) or indirect (e.g. derivatives) and accordingly, capital and liquidity requirements rules could apply. For instance, the committee has proposed that crypto-assets should not be eligible to serve as financial collateral for the purpose of the credit risk mitigation framework.

It has also recommended that bank exposures to crypto-assets should be subject to a “full deduction” from Common Equity Tier 1 capital, which mainly consists of common stock held by a bank. “This treatment reflects the high degree of uncertainty about the positive realizable value of crypto-assets in times of stress,” it added.

While banks’ exposures to crypto-assets are currently “limited,” the absolute size of the market is “meaningful,” said the committee, adding that a “robust” regulatory framework is needed for the sector.



Warning

In March, the committee warned banks about risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including liquidity, credit and money laundering risks. “The continued growth of crypto-asset trading platforms and new financial products related to crypto-assets has the potential to raise financial stability concerns and increase risks faced by banks,” it said at the time.

Reiterating its point, the committee said that if a crypto-asset and a ""traditional"" asset are equivalent in their economic functions and the risks they pose, they should not be treated differently for prudential purposes. ""There is the potential for certain types of crypto-assets to become systemically important. The design of the prudential treatment of crypto-assets should therefore be simple and flexible in nature,"" said the committee.

If the committee decides to go ahead with any specified treatment, it would constitute a minimum standard for internationally active banks. The discussion paper is open for comments until March 13, 2020 to all stakeholders, including academics, banks, central banks, finance ministries, market participants and the general public, among others."

From a bearish Bitcoin prediction to new adoption for XRP, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin

A popular crypto analyst says Bitcoin is likely on the verge of another major breakdown.

The analyst, known in the industry as Rampage, tells his 31,000 followers on Twitter that BTC appears to be caught in a cycle that’s happened a couple of times in the past.

“Bitcoin is a repeating history lesson immediately forgotten by pumps. Dump cycles matter.”

The pattern begins with a parabolic rally. Soon after, BTC retreats and enters a period of consolidation. Then, a second rally to a lower high begins, followed by a long-term collapse and bear market.

If the analyst is right, BTC could be trending toward $6,000.

“Can’t find one single bullish argument on any of the time frames for BTC. We’re getting a dead cat in my opinion and at this stage next area of interest for longs is $6,000. Net short and chill holiday gang.

Ethereum

In a new interview with The Block, Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, says the investment giant will support Ethereum in 2020.

“We’ve done a lot of work on Ethereum. We intend to support it in the New Year. We’re very led by our clients.

And again, coming back to the fact that we’re speaking to a lot of traditional institutions, Bitcoin is sort of like the gateway product, right? It’s the thing that’s got perhaps the longest track record, the most observable data points across multiple exchanges around price activity.”

Fidelity Digital Assets officially rolled out its Bitcoin custody platform for institutional investors in October of this year.

Ripple and XRP

Ripple is spreading the word on Twitter about new adoption for the digital asset XRP.

Salt Lending now supports XRP for clients who want to use their digital assets as collateral to secure a USD loan.

“We’ve added XRP as our latest collateral type for a crypto backed loan. Check out our website to see how you can utilize XRP with Salt.”

Salt also supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Dogecoin, TruUSD, USD Coin, Paxos Standard Token and PAX Gold.

Cardano

IOHK, the technology and engineering company that developed Cardano, says it has enabled staking on its incentivized testnet.

Staking allows investors to earn rewards on their holdings of the cryptocurrency ADA in return for helping to power the network and process transactions.

“The launch sequence has begun… destination? Staking! This afternoon we’ve successfully spun up and tested the Shelley Incentivized Testnet network. We’re now inviting our Cardano Stake pool operator partners to get set up over the weekend.

Next, we’ll do final confirmatory testing. Once operators are ready – and everyone’s happy – we’ll prepare new Rewards wallets for download. ETA Mon/Tues. Sign up to alerts and we’ll tell you once the wallets are ready. See you after the weekend!”

Finman bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin at the age of 12 in 2011, when each bitcoin was worth $10 to $12. Today he holds 446 bitcoin, which at Friday's price were worth $7,243 each, for a total value of $3.2 million.

Finman is calling his latest endeavor a ""crypto space drop,"" by which cryptocurrency can be sent through a constellation of satellites to an antenna on Earth. Finman told Business Insider the crypto space drop had applications for communities with little to no infrastructure.

""We wanted to show that even in the most remote places that don't have the most functional of infrastructure, money infrastructure, financial infrastructure,"" a crypto space drop could have a real use case, Finman told Business Insider.

Finman sent $1,000 worth of MTL in the crypto space drop to St. Mary's School in Korle Gonno in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana, which used the funds to repair the school's roof and construct benches and tables.

MTL is the cryptocurrency used by the cryptocurrency platform Metal Pay, which launched in August with Finman as an investor. Finman called Metal Pay the ""the Facebook Libra killer,"" saying, ""If it needs it, I'm willing to put all my bitcoin money into this"" and ""I'm willing to bet it all"" in his Metal Pay announcement video.

One of the satellites used in the constellation was a satellite Finman helped launch one year ago.

In December 2018, Finman led Project Da Vinci, for which a group of teenagers launched a satellite that included a crypto wallet. Project Da Vinci was part of NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites program, which attracts and retains STEM students and allows students to launch small satellites.

Check out Finman's crypto space drop:","One of the most debated topics in the crypto space is the underlying value of cryptocurrencies.

Unlike stocks, most cryptocurrencies do not give any legal entitlements to holders.

Therefore, crypto-asset trading is mostly unregulated opposed to common stock trading on the majority of stock exchanges.

So what are the key differences between trading stocks and cryptocurrencies?

The main points I will discuss here are:

Ownership and possession

Legal rights

The Howey test and why a great deal of cryptocurrencies are unregulated

Stocks vs cryptocurrencies: Ownership and possession

One of the main differences between traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies is ownership.

Even though a unit of stock grants its owner a piece of a company, cryptocurrency usually does not. I’ll discuss legal rights in depth in the next section.

For now, what matters is ownership. Remember the famous Andreas Antonopolous quote, “not your keys, not your coins”?

Well, that’s exactly my point. Cryptocurrencies are much easier to own than stock. Even though most investors and traders do purchase a derivative of stock, the stock itself is not with the user.

This means to properly own stock, you cannot just purchase the asset on an exchange. You must make sure you get the actual paper-stock.

With cryptocurrencies, the process is usually much easier. First, there are plenty of ways to trade crypto-assets peer-to-peer (P2P). Decentralised and non-custodial exchanges are becoming more common by the day.

Second, in less than 10 minutes, we’re able to transfer assets from exchanges to private wallets. The process is much faster and simpler with cryptocurrencies than with stock.

Exceptions are STOs, or Security Token Offerings, which grant the owner an equity share of a company. However, I’m ignoring those for the purpose of the article as they represent a very small share of the overall cryptocurrency pie.

Stocks vs cryptocurrencies: Legal rights

As mentioned above, stock usually entitles owners to legal rights, such as dividends (a share of the company profits).

However, imagine a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Ownership is quite easy to have, but that does not entitle users to legal rights.

Remember the DAO hack? Or the Mt Gox hack?

Even though people tried to get their funds back, the majority was lost. And there are much fewer legal recourses for cryptocurrency investors and traders.

The advantage is the insane amount of volatility in the cryptocurrency market, which helps traders get rich (or lose everything) much quicker.

Stocks vs cryptocurrencies: The Howey test

To conclude, I would like to draw attention to the Howey test. Even though it’s not essentially 100% accurate to use it for cryptocurrencies, it’s still the best we’ve got.

What the Howey test defines is whether or not an asset will be categorised as a security by financial regulators.

Put simply, the Howey test asks whether the value of a transaction for one of the participants is dependent upon the other’s work.

Specifically, the Howey test determines whether a transaction represents an investment contract if “a person invests their money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party”.

Essentially, if an asset, digital or not, falls into any of the below categories, it will be labeled a security:

It is an investment of money There is an expectation of profits from the investment The investment of money is in a common enterprise Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party

If any of these categories apply to the asset in question, the cryptocurrency will most likely be a security and should be treated as common stock.","How do you explain ethereum to someone who doesn’t know how to use email? What’s the best way to convey how many satoshis add up to a single bitcoin?

Those are among the questions faced by Yousif Mohammed, a 16-year-old Syrian refugee in Iraq’s Arbat refugee camp, who teaches other people in the camp about cryptocurrency.

“I want to solve a problem in my community. We have a lot of problems, like corruption,” he said.

Since he still has family left behind in Damascus, he’s particularly fond of the idea they could all earn and send money among their dispersed social networks, regardless of the borders that have increasingly failed them in recent years.

“People really need to know all the things about the internet and their phones and laptops,” he said. “We are in an advanced world and we should learn.”

Mohammed owns a small amount of ether, which he earned through a local education program run by the nonprofit Hello Future. It’s too little to spend, so he’s eager to earn more. Hello Future founder Charlie Grosso said she gave ether because it was less expensive than bitcoin.

Grosso said most of the students in Mohammed’s class think of mobile devices and computers like old-school Nintendos: They know they can play games or use a calculator, but are unfamiliar with access to global networks.

“The idea of searching to verify information is unknown to them,” she said. “They just don’t have that framework.”

Even with this steep learning curve, Grosso said all 44 teens that took her digital literacy class quickly grasped the concept of stateless, digital money. Perhaps this is because they are familiar with gold and other tangible assets. Plus, there’s no PayPal in Iraq because local banks are still restricted by economic sanctions.

In some ways, people who only know cash economies may be better suited to crypto markets than those who underestimate the value of social ties.

Mama bank

“Two years ago, I got my first phone. Now everyone in my family has a smartphone,” Mohammed said. “I like games like Minecraft because I can build things, design things and improve my English.”

Like many of the 9,000 residents in the camp, his unbanked family stores its wealth with the matriarch who runs the household.

Mohammed’s sister works at a bakery, his father is a carpenter and his brother works in a nearby town at a digital marketing agency (he even has a laptop). Each breadwinner turns over a salary to the matriarch, who doles out cash as needed to any member of the family. This is a common practice in the developing world, especially in times of economic turmoil.

“My mom is like the bank,” Mohammed laughed. “Cryptocurrency might be good for saving money because if you put your money inside a bank, the bank might steal it.”

Grosso said she hopes to graduate 100 students from her digital literacy course in 2020, further expanding the pool of crypto-savvy teens that can help their parents learn. Without their social networks, places like Arbat that lack crypto-exchange access will continue to be liquidity deserts.","Quantum supremacy is officially here, whether we’re ready for it or not. This fall, a research paper from Google was prematurely leaked, claiming just that — quantum supremacy — including the results of a test where its 54-qubit processor performed in 200 seconds a computation that it says would have previously taken 10,000 years, kicking off this century’s version of the space race.

With Amazon also getting into the quantum game on a consumer level by launching its own quantum computing service called Braket, allowing developers to run simulations on a “cloud” of quantum computers from D-Wave, IonQ and Rigetti, 2020 could be an even bigger year for the looming prospect of quantum computing.

Think of the leaps made by mobile computing in the span of a little more than a decade, starting two decades ago, when we went from the PalmOS to iOS. With Moore’s Law of exponential processor growth slowing down or stalling permanently, large manufacturers of enterprise and personal computing hardware cannot allow consumers to get out of the habit of the “upgrade cycle.” The growing demands of enterprise and cloud computing almost require a need for quantum computing to evolve into a new market, even if the initial use cases are limited and apply almost exclusively to governments, research institutions and the cloud.

The onus is not just on these large companies but on everyone to start thinking about the foundation of new quantum-secure networks that can leverage quantum entanglement to generate provable random numbers and the next-generation hashing algorithms that will provide secure cryptography for this new computing age.

A perfect storm of trouble for our data

The general consensus remains that we might see the first implementation of quantum computers in as little as 10 years. Whether quantum computing is mainstreamed in 10, 50 or 200 years, Pandora’s box has already been opened. The biggest names in computing, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM, will be using significant resources to ensure they don’t lose the battle to colonize the next frontier of computing.

With the significant impact of quantum computing on artificial intelligence — another important area of prospective research and development for these companies — this will only further stoke the flames of motivation for discovering new quantum breakthroughs.

Quantum computing and cryptocurrencies

While the implementation of quantum computing may affect nearly every aspect of our lives that touches the digital realm, the largest implications may be for the cryptocurrency industry. Today, cryptocurrencies’ pseudo-random generation of keys continues to make them susceptible to exploitation by hackers, and quantum computing will only increase the likelihood of predicting software-generated values in the blink of an eye, presenting major security concerns.

As elegant and essentially perfect as Satoshi Nakamoto’s protocol is, the creator couldn’t account for a world where quantum computing could realistically be applied to compromise proof-of-work before the termination of crypto mining. If there is one imperfection in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it’s that they were built during what might ultimately be the end of an era for a certain type of cryptography, a realm where obsolescence is certainly no option.

Considering that 2140 is the year that the last Bitcoin will be mined, that leaves a large window of time for quantum computing to reach the kind of popularity and scale where it can be used to compromise and crash Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a long-feared 51% attack. With quantum computing executing in seconds what would take millennia for the fastest supercomputers to process, easily taking over more than 50% of Bitcoin’s mining hashrate would be one of many tools at a potential attacker’s disposal.

Additionally, with Satoshi’s addresses so well known, it wouldn’t take much for a quantum attacker to compromise the private keys for those addresses and take Satoshi’s own coins — there would be billions and billions of reasons worth of incentive.

Preserving crypto’s uncrackable code

Any of these outcomes would be disastrous not only for Bitcoin, but for the fundamental principles of cryptocurrency. As long as cryptocurrencies pseudo-randomly generate keys, they will be susceptible to exploitation by hackers. The arrival of quantum computing will escalate this susceptibility to full-blown vulnerability.

So how do we prevent such a disastrous outcome for the future of crypto?

First, the industry as a whole has to acknowledge the problem, especially as large-scale companies continue further down the road of development of quantum without knowing the full consequences of what that exploration will yield. After all, it appears as though Google did not intend to publicize its “quantum supremacy” research as early as it did. As much as these large companies see themselves as responsible custodians of data and technology, they can barely secure the mere bytes that make up our credit card and other account information online. What happens when they possess the means to workable quantum?

The industry therefore needs to work on building quantum security as vigorously, if not more vigorously, than developing quantum itself. This would include quantum-secure networks focused on photon sources for genuine random number generation and next-generation hashing algorithms. Moving cryptocurrencies away from proof-of-work and other mechanisms where entire blockchains are stored insecurely would be another measure worth exploring.

Without taking these steps, Satoshi’s work, Bitcoin, and the decentralized internet will have all been for naught. The problems we have seen the internet encounter already this century — large companies holding money above user rights, nation-states holding power above civil rights, and criminals exploiting this flawed architecture — will only continue on through the rest of the century, but on a new quantum field of play.

However, if we start now on a security framework for quantum, we might just be able to maintain the integrity so vital to keeping the internet, cryptocurrencies and our other vital connected technologies working as they should.

Do you remember receiving your first bitcoin? Seeing those satoshis arrive in your wallet is a magical, almost spiritual, experience. In that moment, the most beautiful thing about bitcoin is not its censorship resistance or pseudonymity: it’s that it works at the first time of asking. No pending account verification, no weekend processing delays, and no questions. What about Lightning bitcoin? Could it too work at the first time of asking? As Lightning Network approaches its second anniversary, I decided to find out.

Bitcoin Core Needs Lightning – But Is Lightning Ready?

Blockchain Capital caused a stir last week when it predicted onchain BTC fees to hit $100 in 2020. This will be “a positive development” according to the firm’s Spencer Bogart as it will force “scaling up the stack” to Lightning Network (LN). Even if that prophecy doesn’t come to pass, and fees “only” reach $10, Lightning will be sorely needed, not least to the 3.4 billion people who earn less than $5.50 a day. The question is, two years into its lifespan, is Lightning ready to pick up the slack? To find out, I downloaded two bitcoin maximalist-recommended LN wallets and got to work.

First though, a preface: news.Bitcoin.com is known for its support of Bitcoin Cash and its onchain approach to scaling. We nevertheless cover BTC extensively, albeit with less focus on Lightning Network, since it is experimental technology that has scarcely been used in the wild up until now. That said, with Bitfinex announcing support for LN deposits and withdrawals earlier this month, there are signs that the tide is turning. The next few months will be critical for Lightning: either it starts working, all the time for all the people, or there’s a risk of LN being written off as a failed experiment.

If Lightning isn’t ready for mass adoption the next time onchain fees pass $50, either the public will go elsewhere – be it to BCH, EOS, or any other network that can pick up the strain – or they’ll give up on crypto for good. If that happens, bitcoin will effectively exist as a custodial asset only, suitable for investing but never transacting. And if that happens, it won’t just be Lightning that’s deemed a failed experiment – it will be Bitcoin itself. There’s a lot riding on Lightning Network’s performance over the next few months then. Can LN step up and prove that it’s production ready?

Putting Phoenix Wallet to the Test

Billed as “the bitcoin wallet from the future,” Phoenix’s architects aren’t afraid to sing the praises of their new LN wallet. After seeing well-known bitcoiner Matt Odell tweeting his support for Phoenix, I decided it would be an ideal jumping off point for my debut Lightning experience.

Last month, I helped a friend buy his first BTC, showing him how to install the Exodus wallet and transfer his newly acquired coins to it. It worked at the first time of asking, the same way it has with everyone I’ve introduced to bitcoin over the years. Could I, with seven years of bitcoin experience, get a Lightning wallet to work at the first attempt?

After installing and opening the Phoenix Android app, I’m prompted to backup my wallet and set a PIN, as is standard with any noncustodial crypto wallet. I’m then presented with the following screen:

What I’m aiming to do is send onchain BTC to Lightning, in whatever way the app will allow me to. After pressing “Receive,” I tap the QR code to copy the address and then paste it into the “Send” field of one of my BTC wallets. Upon pasting the QR code, however, it turns out that it contains the following:

lnbc1pwlva5epp5z77fkphh….scq6zw5hu

That’s not a BTC address – it’s a Lightning one, which only works for transactions on the Lightning Network. But all is not lost, for below the QR code in Phoenix is a button that reads “Show a bitcoin address,” which displays the following prompt:

I’d prefer not to pay a 0.5% fee: if I was sending 1 BTC, that means I’d be charged £35. Still, this is Lightning, which isn’t yet ready for receiving transactions of that size, so the 0.5% fee can be forgiven for now. What can’t be forgiven is what happens next: the infinite spinning wheel of death, as I’m instructed to “Please hold.”

Two days later, and I’m still no further along.

Putting Nayuta Wallet to the Test

The next LN wallet I try is Nayuta, a hybrid full-node/SPV Lightning mobile wallet that was brought to my attention by Nomics. The wallet is still in beta, and comes liberally coated in disclaimers to that effect:

That being the case, I’m prepared to cut Nayuta some slack. It’s not like I’m trying to open dozens of Lightning channels, add a watchtower, or run a local node: I just want to get some onchain BTC to LN. That shouldn’t be too hard, right?

There’s a button marked ‘Lightning’ across the bottom of the Nayuta app and another marked ‘Onchain.’ I press the latter, select ‘Receive’ and am shown a BTC address. Despite being in beta, Nayuta’s already gotten me further than Phoenix. I paste the BTC address into the bitcoin wallet I intend to send funds from and run into my first problem: the address format is bech32, and the wallet I’m sending funds from, like most custodial and noncustodial BTC wallets, isn’t compatible. This isn’t a Lightning problem – it’s a bitcoin one – but it’s nevertheless another hurdle in my quest to get funds onto LN.

I log into an exchange account instead and try withdrawing funds from there which, to my pleasant surprise, work with bech32 addresses. Two hours later, however, and there’s still nothing shown up in the Nayuta app. I’d only sent $70 of BTC, but am nevertheless miffed by its failure to appear. After three hours have elapsed, I log into Nayuta again, and this time my funds have magically appeared, but I can’t access them: they’re now being sent from my Nayuta BTC address to my Nayuta Lightning address, minus the 0.5% fee, and the transaction is showing up as unconfirmed. It will require six confirmations before the funds will clear, which means I need to wait another hour.

My understanding of LN is limited (this is my first time after all), but here’s what I’d like to see: a wallet service that will instantly send funds to my LN wallet after a 1-confirmation onchain transaction. In other words, I send BTC onchain from my wallet to theirs, whereupon they immediately send a corresponding amount from their already funded LN channel to me. That’s a service I’d happily pay a 0.5% fee for. But having to wait four hours and counting to get going isn’t going to impress the nocoiners.

Two Years on and Lightning Network Still Isn’t Ready for Mass Adoption

My first experience with Lightning has been interesting, to put it charitably, and maddening to put it more accurately. It feels like there’s a whole world of instant confirmations and low sat transactions waiting for me, if only I could get some damn funds onto the Lightning Network. Then it occurs to me: why am I killing myself trying to break into the promised land of fast, cheap transactions when they’re already at my fingertips with bitcoin cash, litecoin, and doge?

It’s possible that I’ve made some noob mistake in trying to get connected to Lightning Network, but since there’s zero guidance in either of the LN wallets I tried, I’ve no way of knowing. And that’s the whole point: if LN can befuddle a bitcoiner of seven years, we’re still years away from it being ready for mainstream adoption.

I check my Nayuta wallet one last time. The transaction from my onchain wallet to my LN wallet was initiated 16 hours ago. Current status: unconfirmed.

But behind that opaque acronym is a world of improvements to over-the-air TV that will bring 4K picture, premium sound and interactive features into your home for free.

The Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) is an industry group that determines the technologies used for broadcasters nationwide, and the ATSC 3.0 standard is the newest version of over-the-air TV.

NextGen TV – the Consumer Technology Association's (CTA) remarkably anodyne marketing name for the new ATSC 3.0 standard – may not mean much to most people, but it's coming to the U.S. in 2020, and will play a big role in reshaping the modern TV experience.

Even if you have heard of it, chances are good that you're not sure what it means. Broadcasting standards are full of technical jargon and industry terms that won't mean much to the average TV viewer, but the end results will be huge in the coming years. We're here to clear up the confusion and help you understand how the new broadcasting standard will change your TV viewing experience in 2020 and beyond.

Here are the highlights: NextGen TV is a huge upgrade for traditional broadcasting, offering 4K resolution and HDR content for over-the-air broadcasts, along with dramatically better sound, interactive features and the ability to broadcast to more than just TVs. It's better, smarter broadcast TV for the era of smart TVs, phones, homes and cars. And it will be the exact same price as current broadcast TV – free.

Some background: Analog signal and ATSC 1.0

Do you remember back in 2009, when anybody using a TV antenna had to switch to the new digital system? That was the change from analog UHF and VHF channels to ATSC 1.0, which shifted TV broadcasts from a raw signal that was fed straight to the TV, to a digital one that allowed for compressed video and additional data. That, in turn, allowed broadcasters to offer an over-the-air signal while using less spectrum, and introduced some features we now take for granted, like full-HD (1920 x 1080) resolution and digital-closed captioning.

(Image credit: Vizio)

But that digital switch over was based on standards developed back in 1995, and the world of media consumption is drastically different than it was 25 years ago. Today, video is much more than traditional broadcast TV, with online streaming, smart TVs running apps and people viewing movies and shows on a wide range of devices.

The switch to ATSC 3.0 is the first major upgrade to broadcast standards since that 2009 switch, but unlike the move to digital, which introduced minor changes to the actual content and viewing experience, ATSC 3.0 opens the door to several significant changes and enhancements.

What is ATSC 3.0?

The new ATSC 3.0 standard takes everything about the initial switch to digital TV broadcasting and upgrades it. Among the improvements offered by NextGen TV are:

Better signal quality with less interference.

Higher resolution, with 4K picture and potential for 8K in the future.

Combines broadcast TV with broadband internet.

Available on many more devices.

It also could present the first major shift in the one-to-many model of broadcast distribution. With connectivity allowing interactive features, customizable content and addressable advertising, the broadcast world is about to look a lot more like the streaming world, and that will shake things up considerably on the business side.

But let's look at what it means for viewers first.

Better signal with less interference

One of the biggest issues with ATSC 1.0 is that the digital signal is fairly fragile. The VHF band used is prone to interference from buildings and trees, weather and even passing cars, and the digital data it sends is easily corrupted, which shows up on your TV as a blocky, unwatchable picture, or even just a ""no signal"" message.

With ATSC 3.0, broadcasters are switching back to UHF and moving to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), the same technology behind the latest Wi-Fi and mobile wireless technologies. It's a much more robust method for transmitting digital information, and when combined with the switch back to UHF, it will let local TV stations offer a clearer signal with broader reach and fewer interference issues.

Better picture and sound

The new standard also packs much more data into the broadcast signal, ramping up from the single static 19.4 Mbps bitrate of the ATSC 1.0 standard to a variable bitrate of up to 57 Mbps using the same airwaves.

It pairs that efficiency with modern video formats. The same H.265 and MPEG-H Part 2 codecs used by online media companies like Netflix can now be shared over the airwaves, letting TV stations broadcast in 4K.

Ultra-HD 4K resolution TV programming is planned for the 2020 rollout, and even 8K resolution is a possibility within the new standard. In addition to higher resolutions, the new broadcasts can also support higher frame rates, up to 120 frames per second – twice the rate that the common 60Hz refresh rate can handle.

(Image credit: Sony)

The 3.0 standard also adds wide color gamut data and high dynamic range (HDR) metadata, which will make for better viewing, with a deeper picture that has bright highlights, rich shadows and a wider range of colors to work with. This widespread availability of 4K, HDR-enabled content will also allow more people to take advantage of current 4K TVs, where full resolution media is mostly limited to Blu-ray disc or a handful of streaming sources.

Audio quality is being improved, with support for Dolby AC-4 and MPEG-H 3D Audio formats. These are both multichannel audio formats, with support for surround-sound multi-speaker setups and even 3D object-oriented sound for a much more immersive audio experience. The older ASTC 1.0 standard supports 5.1 surround sound, but the 3.0 NextGen TV system allows for up to 7.1.4 channel support and formats like Dolby Atmos can be offered over the air.

The multiple audio streams will also offer customization options, such as multiple languages and video-description services for the visually impaired.

Broadcast meets broadband

One of the biggest changes coming with ATSC 3.0 is a pairing of over-the-air broadcast and internet connectivity. That connectivity adds an extra dimension to the ATSC 3.0 system, allowing for a dedicated return channel – an active stream of data back to the broadcaster, which makes the new broadcast system a two-way IP-based standard. The opens up a wide range of new capabilities never offered by traditional TV before.

To get a clearer idea of what that means, I spoke to Tom Butts, the editor-in-chief of TV Technology magazine, an industry publication aimed at broadcast and cable professionals (and owned by Tom's Guide parent company Future plc).

""The IP component allows broadcasters to better compete with OTT,"" Butts said, referring to over-the-top content providers like Hulu and SlingTV, which deliver content with a set-top box (i.e., cable or satellite). It does this, he says, by letting broadcasters ""complement their broadcasts with streaming services, offering most of the same capabilities enabled by the cloud including DVR controls, VOD [Video-on-Demand], targeted advertising and more flexible audio options.""

(Image credit: Amazon)

For viewers, that may mean that TV stations will offer streams of recently aired shows in a ""Catch-up"" service that's offered as part of their free broadcast. Or, it could allow for a more intuitive menu-style guide to shows and movies, more like what you'll see on streaming apps like Netflix, and then automatically select between live signal or streaming for a wider selection of shows.

It also lets broadcasters gather far more information about what people are watching, and when. Instead of relying on ratings organizations like Nielsen, which use surveys and closely monitored audience samples, it would provide live information about how many people are actually watching a given show, minute-by-minute.

It also opens the door for addressable advertising, the ability to target ads to different users, even within the same household. That might mean that when the parents are watching the latest sitcom in the living room, they see car commercials and ads for mortgage refinancing, while a teenaged child watching the same show in another room will see ads for gum.

It may also allow for interactive features, like selectable pop-up information that lets you check stock prices when a company is mentioned in the news, or give local businesses a way to offer discounts to viewers in their area.

Beyond just ""TV""

According to industry analyst Tim Hanlon, CEO of The Vertere Group, a media consultancy firm, that fusion of broadcast and internet could see some radically new applications, too.

""The possibilities are virtually endless,"" Hanlon said. ""[It enables] potentially a robust array of 'beyond-TV' functions/businesses such as emergency alerts, hard-drive data-caching, consumer electronics upgrade patches, enterprise data streaming (for a variety of industries), smart vehicle/cities data, etc.""

What those ""beyond-TV"" functions will actually be when ATSC 3.0 comes to market has yet to be seen. One of the most intriguing potential features would let local authorities and broadcasters remotely power up your TV to display local emergency broadcast alerts. A feature like that could be useful to alert people about earthquakes or storms in their areas.

""In addition, its capabilities in providing far more targeted and detailed, graphics-rich news and information in emergency situations … could have the greatest impact of all, especially when cellular networks are overloaded,"" TV Technology's Butts said. ""In short, it does what broadcasters are required to do by law: Make much more efficient use of the public spectrum.""

What about privacy?

The added connectivity does have some privacy advocates a little spooked about ATSC 3.0, even as the standard makes its first tentative steps into the market.

(Image credit: Amazon)

Even the FCC is concerned. While the FCC approved the 3.0 standard in late 2017, Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel offered a dissenting opinion . Among other issues, she wrote that ""there are still big questions about this new standard. ... I also think we need to better understand targeted advertising on television and the implications for privacy, the use of encrypted signals, the collection of audience data, and the susceptibility to hacking and malware.""

The upshot here is that the new TV standard can gather data only if you provide it with the connectivity to do so. Disconnecting your TV from the internet should let you watch OTA TV completely free from any data gathering. But, as with modern smart TVs, you'll need to be connected to enjoy the full range of features offered by modern devices and services.

The support for higher data density and modern video formats also means that broadcasters could add digital-rights management (DRM) protections to OTA content, restricting users' ability to use home-recording hardware, like DVRs.

So far, there's no evidence that either of these concerns will materialize as real problems as the ATSC 3.0 standard goes mainstream in the coming years. And neither of these issues are any different than those faced by current smart TV users, or anyone who uses online streaming services on other devices. But at the end of the day, it's possible that data monitoring and even limited use of broadcast content might wind up being the inevitable result of smarter technology.

What devices will get ATSC 3.0?

You're probably asking yourself, ""Do I need to buy anything to watch ATSC 3.0 broadcasts?"" The answer is yes and no. The TV antennas already on the market will still work once the switch is made, since the changes are to the information carried over the air and not the signals that carry it. Whether you have an indoor set of bunny ears or a large outdoor aerial, the antenna you have now will still work after your local broadcasters have switched to 3.0.

(Image credit: LG)

The FCC is actually requiring local broadcasters to continue carrying the current ATSC 1.0 standard alongside the new 3.0 system for a five-year period. That clock starts when a station begins using ATSC 3.0, so even if your local broadcasters switched today, you would still have several years before you had to switch to new equipment.

The answer is slightly more complicated when it comes to decoding the new signal, however. Your antenna may act like the ears that hear the signal, but the TV tuner is what understands the language being spoken, and that's changing. So, yes, you will eventually need to upgrade to an ATSC 3.0 TV tuner.

And the first TVs with built-in 3.0 tuners will begin arriving in 2020, making this upgrade a seamless part of getting a new TV, no external box required. We've already seen confirmation that at least one of LG's 2020 TVs will come equipped for the new standard, with ATSC 3.0 tuners built in.

But the benefits of ATSC 3.0 may extend beyond your living room and your existing antenna. While new applications are still being explored, the industry is exploring several other uses for the new 3.0 signal, including live TV on mobile devices and a number of novel applications for vehicles.

Wait, I can use it on my phone? And in my car?

Due to the somewhat fragile signal quality of ATSC 1.0, the use and reliability of portable TVs had a sharp decline over the last several years. However, because ATSC 3.0 will introduce improved coverage and signal penetration it should offer dramatically better performance in situations like a moving vehicle.

And with the right chipset, your phone could receive ATSC 3.0 broadcasts all on its own. Although a lot of people are pessimistic about phone makers putting an option for data-free TV into their phones – carriers make a lot of money thanks to data-hungry streaming services – it's worth noting that major phone makers have been involved in the development of the 3.0 standard.

""Cellular companies are reluctant to offer their customers devices that would support an alternate (aka ""free"") streaming service that would compete with their services,"" said Butts of TV Technology. ""However, the fact that LG, Samsung and Sony have invested in the development of ATSC 3.0 bodes well for support in their products, which I'm sure we'll see at CES.""

This stands to be great news for mobile entertainment, whether it's in the car or in your pocket. And, because many of these devices can gather location data, there's an opportunity for more local advertising – such as gas station ads when you're on the road – and even more novel uses such as sharing map data and local weather and emergency alerts.

What about existing broadcast channels?

Switching to a new standard won't make your current channels disappear, so there's no need to worry about losing your local favorites if you don't buy an ATSC 3.0-capable TV or tuner.

All your favorite shows, including reruns, will also be available. Because NextGen TV offers greater bandwidth, all of the lower resolution content that's already offered on TV can still be shared on the 3.0 system, including all 1080p and 720p content.

And the existing channels, broadcast under the older ATSC 1.0 standard, aren't going anywhere, either – at least not right away. The FCC is requiring broadcasters to continue offering ATSC 1.0 broadcasts alongside the new 3.0 standard for five years from the date of transitioning over to 3.0.

ATSC 3.0 timeline: When will it come to my city?

The first test markets for the new TV standard have opened up over the last few years in places like Phoenix, Cleveland and Washington, D.C., but these have so far been small-scale tests as broadcasters figure out how to implement the new technology. That should begin to change this year, however.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Butts explained, ""Earlier this year, broadcasters promised to deploy ATSC 3.0 in the top 40 U.S. markets by the end of 2020 and likewise, consumer electronics companies predicted that new ATSC 3.0-enabled TV sets would be available by the holiday season a year from now.""

That sounds like a good first step in bringing ATSC 3.0 to people throughout the United States. But don't get your hopes up too high.

""This is a promise,"" said Butts, ""and unlike the DTV transition, there is no mandate that they follow through.""

Unlike the 2009 switch to digital TV, the move to ATSC 3.0 isn't being pushed forward by government mandates, so the actual timeframe for when the NextGen TV standard goes live in your area is a bit vague.

However, several major TV broadcasting groups have already committed to embracing NextGen TV, including NBCUniversal Owned Stations Group, Nexstar Media Group, Pearl TV, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Spectrum Co. and Univision. Between them, these organizations control hundreds of local broadcasters across the country, and should help shift the industry toward adopting ATSC 3.0 soon.

And what about those 40 cities that will transition in 2020? Here's a list of the largest cities and regions that will be included in these early roll outs:

Dallas-Ft. Worth

Houston

San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose

Phoenix

Seattle-Tacoma, Wash.

Detroit

Orlando-Daytona Beach-Melbourne, Fla.

Portland, Ore.

Pittsburgh

Raleigh-Durham, N.C.

Baltimore

Nashville, Tenn.

Salt Lake City

San Antonio, Texas

Kansas City, Kan.-Mo.-

Columbus, Ohio

West Palm Beach-Ft. Pierce, Fla

Las Vegas

Austin, Texas

Should I wait to buy an ATSC 3.0-compatible TV?

The short answer? No. There aren't any on the market yet, and even external tuner boxes are expensive and extremely limited in number. And while 3.0 broadcasts are going to start coming available in 2020, it will be a gradual rollout, over the course of the year. Most people won't really have access to 3.0 signal or equipment until late 2020.

If you're already thinking about buying a TV, there's no reason to wait a whole year just to get on the NextGen TV bandwagon early. However, if the ATSC 3.0 transition moves as quickly as some industry groups want, the likelihood of NextGen TV sets being widespread in the next two or three years is high.

In any case, we'll be keeping an eye on the situation, and will make recommendations accordingly, whether the new standard flourishes or fizzles.",
2019-12-16,"Interest in cryptocurrencies has been on the rise throughout 2019 and Bitcoin’s (BTC) impressive 300% rally from $3,130 in February 2019 to $13,800 on June 26 surely had something to do with growing interest.

Multiple studies have shown that millennials and younger investors, in particular, have grown increasingly skeptical of traditional financial service providers and banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. At least 40% of this demographic has said that they intend to invest in cryptocurrency in the future.

Fortunately for new investors, investing in digital assets has become much easier than it was pre-2017. But there are still a few crucial factors investors should consider before actually buying cryptocurrency.

Here are four essential things investors must consider as you make your first cryptocurrency purchase and consider trading.

Market capitalization

Currently, there are more than 4,900 cryptocurrencies listed across a long list of exchanges. Media tend to only cover the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and these are the tokens most familiar to new and seasoned investors.

Basically, market capitalization (or market cap) reflects the size of a company and the metric is calculated by taking the asset’s price and multiplying it by the total number of available shares.

It also provides insight into the level of risk an investment represents and this is why It’s important to check a digital asset’s market cap prior to buying.

Tokens with a high market cap and large circulating supply are theoretically less vulnerable to manipulation and wild volatility, whereas smaller market cap coins can see wild price springs on positive or negative news. A small market cap coin with little circulating supply is also often vulnerable to manipulation by large holders.

Trading volume

Prior to making a purchase, investors should also take a quick look at the digital asset’s trading volume.

Usually, this isn’t an issue for the top-20 tokens listed on crypto exchange data providers like Coin360. But as traders begin to investigate more obscure smaller market cap altcoins, it’s very important to investigate how many tokens are actually being bought and sold on a daily basis.

Higher trading volume means it will be easier to buy and sell the digital asset whereas low trading volume hints at a lack of liquidity and means a trader could struggle to buy the digital asset or have existing orders filled.

Digital currencies with extremely low trading volume could be a sign of an ailing or dead project; and as recently as November, some of the largest crypto exchanges delisted tokens with questionable or declining trading volume.

Stop-losses and taking profits

While this tip is not a metric that plays into digital asset analysis, it is incredibly important to have a plan for every trade. This helps one not fall victim to emotion-led trading.

Good investors develop a game plan for the price at which they intend to buy and sell an asset without deviating from this plan. Part of this process includes thinking about what actions one will take in the event that the trade goes belly up.

A stop-loss order protects investors against a significant loss of funds by selling the asset at a predetermined price slightly below the purchasing price.

For example, a common rookie mistake is placing a sell-order at a certain price and then canceling the order right before it is filled because the fear of missing out, or FOMO, makes you feel like the price will go even higher.

Cryptocurrencies are infamous for their whipsaw volatility, which can drive the price up by 100% in 1 hour and drop it by 115% an hour later. For this reason, it is paramount that investors use a stop-loss to protect against losses.

Those familiar with the crypto-jargon frequently used among traders will recognize the term “bag holder.” These are traders who bought into a particular cryptocurrency and after a dramatic drop in price are unable to sell the digital asset without taking on significant losses.

Stop-losses protect against this and most traders recommend that a stop-loss be placed 2 to 4% below the purchase price. With this said, it is also important to note that in the cryptocurrency market, stop hunts or stop runs are a common practice that larger investors use to force smaller investors out of their positions.

Investors tend to position their buy and sell orders around an asset’s resistance levels and during a stop hunt, large investors and whales push the price in a direction which can trigger large amounts of stop orders and lead to a drastic change in the asset’s price. Traders can avoid becoming a victim of a stop run by placing their sell stop orders slightly away from resistance and support areas.

Given the volatile nature of most cryptocurrencies, it’s better to take a small loss and live to trade another day instead of holding a digital asset that may continue to lose value over time as has been the case with many altcoins since December 2017.

Safely storing your cryptocurrency

Now that you’ve got your crypto investment the next crucial step is determining how and where to securely store it.

While keeping your Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency on your exchange is an option, the counterparty risk makes this method less secure and should be avoided if possible, particularly for significant amounts.

The adage: only trade and keep funds on an exchange that you are willing to lose cannot be stressed enough.

Thus, many investors rely on hardware wallets that store the digital assets — or more precisely, the private keys to those digital assets — offline where they can only be accessed by the owner.

Moreover, there is also a plethora of software wallets available, which allow investors to store their own private keys to their Bitcoin and cryptos with an app that can be accessed from their laptop, iPad, smartphone, etc.

Ultimately, both are better options than keeping your fund with a custodian such as an exchange as the possibility of getting hacked and funds’ theft is always there regardless of how “secure” an exchange claims to be. Sometimes the users get reimbursed, sometimes not. But this is certainly a risk that every digital asset holder must be aware of when relinquishing control over their funds to some trusted entity.

Investing in cryptocurrency doesn’t have to be difficult or risky. Investors simply need to have a plan before taking action and every responsible trader always does their own research before making an investment in any asset. Make sure you do yours!

The slide began at 18:28 UTC on Monday. In just seven minutes, bitcoin slipped 4 percent, to $6,800 from $7,085 according to data from Coinbase. In that time, ether took a bigger hit, dropping 7 percent from $140 to $130. Neither had seen such lows since Nov. 25, when the crypto markets suffered a temporary selloff.

With little news to go on, the markets found at least one culprit: Chainalysis’ new report, published nearly four and a half hours earlier in the day, saying 20,000 BTC (now worth $137 million) and 790,000 ETH (now worth $102 million) remain likely controlled by PlusToken “scammers.”

Further, Chainalysis claims $185 million in stolen bitcoin have already been liquidated by individuals related to PlusToken.

Six people tied to PlusToken were arrested and extradited to China from Vanuatu, where Beijing claimed the company operated a Ponzi scheme. Chainalysis said it was able to track down $2 billion in cryptocurrencies taken from victims, with a lot of that going to other “investors” – a hallmark of traditional pyramid schemes.

The arrests occurred a little more than a week before bitcoin reached its 2019 peak of $12,575.90. Since then, the cryptocurrency, which represents the lion’s share of the sector’s overall market cap, has drifted downward. While Chainalysis wouldn’t say for certain that liquidations from PlusToken-related accounts sunk bitcoin’s price, the blockchain forensics firm was willing to claim “that those cashouts cause increased volatility in Bitcoin’s price, and that they correlate significantly with Bitcoin price drops.”

A trader at an over-the-counter cryptocurrency broker attributed Monday’s steep decline to jitters that more of PlusToken’s ill-gotten bitcoin and ether was going to flood the market.","Share this article

The Chinese PlusToken scam may have influenced Bitcoin’s price, Chainalysis hypothesizes in a blog post. Though it’s unlikely to be the main factor, movements of stolen funds correlate very well with market downturns.

What is PlusToken?

PlusToken was a classic Ponzi scheme similar to BitConnect or countless others. The founders promised monthly returns from 9 to 18 percent, justified by a combination of alleged trading and mining revenue. It worked similarly to an ICO, as the fraudsters sold PlusToken for Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS and others. PlusToken was able to siphon at least $2 billion in cryptocurrency, making it one of the largest Ponzi schemes in crypto history.

In late June the scam collapsed as its founders exited. One of the transactions from their wallets contained a note saying “Sorry, we have run.” Nevertheless, six of its founders were successfully discovered and extradited from Vanuatu (a small island in the Pacific) to China.

As Chainalysis reported though, the stolen funds continued to be moved long after the arrest.

Complex Mixing Strategies

Though PlusToken did pay some of its initial contributors, Chainalysis was able to definitively prove that 45,000 out of 180,000 collected BTC is controlled by the founders.

PlusToken used thousands of addresses to disseminate the BTC and try to make it untraceable, as well as using tricks such as address type changes and CoinJoin. This appears to have been largely ineffective as Chainalysis successfully tracked the funds to a series of Over The Counter traders operating on the Huobi platform. As they generally have little to no Know Your Client requirements, they are the preferred method to launder illegal proceeds.

Chainalysis hypothesized that these selling attempts were strong enough to influence Bitcoin’s price in a meaningful way.

The firm correlated the flows of PlusToken funds to Bitcoin’s price, seeking to confirm their hypothesis. The charts seem to be supporting their view, as each peak in funds flow was followed by price declines — especially the Sep. 24 drop from $10,000 to $8,000.

Weak Causation

Chainalysis recognized that their findings are not conclusive and do not necessarily prove that PlusToken-induced sales caused the price to fall. Analyzing the average volatility on the Huobi platform, the firm was able to find “a positive, albeit small, statistically significant relationship between PlusToken transfers to Huobi OTC brokers and Bitcoin price volatility for the period of time between September 23rd and 28th.”

However, an increase in volatility may have many other explanations. Huobi reports a volume of more than 100,000 BTC traded on Sep. 25 — four times more than the 25,000 BTC traced through Huobi by Chainalysis.

In a conversation with Crypto Briefing, Mati Greenspan, Founder at QuantumEconomics, commented on the firm’s findings:

“To me it seems plausible but still unverified. Quite clear that it’s not the only factor but it may have contributed.”

On a logical level, the fact that PlusToken sales of Bitcoin contributed to selling pressure is indisputable. However, the magnitude of the pressure is debatable — it’s extremely unlikely that it was directly responsible for the market downturn in the second half of the year. On the other hand, the PlusToken debacle may have contributed to China’s harsh regulatory statements in November.","UPDATE: Jan. 10, 2020: Argo Partners, an investment firm that specializes in buying distressed assets, is offering to purchase claims against cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX. About 76,000 customers of the exchange claim they were left without access to $163 million in cash and cryptocurrencies since Quadriga went offline last year in the wake of CEO Gerald Cotten's death, which has been called into question.

“We offer an upfront, guaranteed payment and also the ability to share distributions if they go above a certain point,” Jonathan Maruri, head of trading at Argo, said in a LinkedIn message seen by Bloomberg. “Given the unknowns in a case like this, we have found it useful to offer creditors deals that lock in rates of recovery early in the case while also protecting themselves from the case taking a turn for the better.”

Maruri declined to say how much Argo Partners was offering creditors for their claims.

Dive Brief:

Lawyers for disgruntled crypto investors asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in a letter Friday to exhume the body of a cryptocurrency trading platform CEO who died under ""questionable circumstances"" last year at age 30 while on his honeymoon in India.

The exchange, QuadrigaCX, did not announce Gerald Cotten’s death until more than a month afterward, and during that time, it accepted deposits but did not allow some users to withdraw funds, CoinDesk reported.

QuadrigaCX went offline in January 2019, filed for creditor protection and announced that Cotten was the only person who knew the private keys to exchange’s “cold wallets” (secure, offline storage), leaving about 76,000 customers without access to $163 million in cash and cryptocurrencies.

Dive Insight:

Cotten’s death has been under suspicion since it was announced, with some circulating a conspiracy theory that the CEO may have faked his own death.

Cotten’s widow, Jennifer Robertson, wrote that he died of complications from Crohn’s disease, which is rarely fatal. However, a death certificate obtained by CoinDesk from the Indian hospital where Cotten reportedly died misspelled his name.

Jayant Sharma, a gastroenterologist who treated Cotten and produced a medical report about his death, confirmed to The Globe and Mail that the man he saw matched photos of Cotten. But the doctor expressed doubts about other aspects of the case. ""We are not sure about the diagnosis,"" he said.

Auditors Ernst & Young found in May the exchange’s crypto wallets were empty, with most of the crypto holdings transferred to other exchanges and wallets. Auditors have recouped about $25 million, according to The Telegraph. But nearly all of that money was cash.​

Substantial amounts of money had been transferred to Cotten’s personal holdings, the auditors found. Cotten appears to have overstated the company’s revenue, and reportedly created fake accounts, using them to trade counterfeit bitcoin for real cash and cryptocurrency, according to the audit. It appears Cotten has kept no records since 2016, according to The Washington Post.

Robertson, Cotten’s widow, agreed in October to transfer nearly all of her assets to Ernst & Young for liquidation and released a statement saying she was unaware of her husband’s “improper actions” while managing Quadriga, according to The Globe and Mail. ""I was upset and disappointed with Gerry’s activities as uncovered by the investigation when I first learned of them,"" she said.

In court filings, Robertson detailed her attempts to recover the cold wallet keys. ""The laptop computer from which Gerry carried out the companies’ business is encrypted and I do not know the password or recovery key,"" she said, according to the Guardian. ""Despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find them written down anywhere.""

Miller Thomson, the law firm representing affected customers, enclosed in its letter Friday to the Mounties ""publicly available information on the history of Quadriga, Gerald Cotten and others related to Quadriga which, in our view, further highlight the need for certainty around the question of whether Mr. Cotten is in fact deceased.""

The firm is asking that an exhumation and autopsy to confirm Cotten’s identity and cause of death ""be completed by Spring of 2020, given decomposition concerns,"" according to the letter.

Investors started to question ""the authenticity of the formal documents in a country notorious for the ease at which falsified documents can be purchased, particularly after they learned that the death certificate misspelled Cotten’s name, and that the former chairman and managing director of the company that ran the hospital had been convicted of financial fraud two months earlier,"" according to Vanity Fair. The magazine also noted Cotten had written a will just four days before going to India.

Robertson said through her attorney, Richard Niedermayer, she was ""heartbroken to learn of [Miller Thomson’s] request.""

""Gerry died on December 9, 2018 in India — an independent investigation by the Globe & Mail confirmed this earlier this year, and it should not be in doubt. While Ms. Robertson has assisted the Quadriga Affected Users in the recovery of assets, and has cooperated fully with Ernst & Young’s investigation, it is not clear how the exhumation or an autopsy to confirm the cause of Gerry’s death from complications arising from his Crohn’s disease would assist the asset recovery process further,"" the statement said.

Earlier in 2018, about $25 million of QuadrigaCX’s assets were frozen after authorities found ""irregularities"" in the company’s payment processes. Days before Cotten died, the funds were returned to the company, according to The Washington Post.

Several agencies, including the FBI, are investigating Quadriga, which is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings in Toronto.","Users of Quadriga CX, a popular Canadian cryptocurrency exchange platform, have asked the police to exhume the body of its founder, Gerald Cotten, to determine whether he's really dead.

In January, the company announced on Facebook that Cotten had died suddenly the previous month from ""complications with Crohn's disease"" while traveling in India. He was 30.

Cotten was the only person with access to digital wallets containing at least 180 million Canadian dollars ($137 million) in cryptocurrency, according to the BBC.

Following his death, the company was forced to close and applied for creditor protection with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court.

Questions surrounding Cotten's mysterious death and rumors of mismanagement within the company began to swirl.

Lawyers representing users of the platform wrote a letter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Friday requesting an autopsy to confirm Cotten's identity and cause of death ""given the questionable circumstances"" surrounding his death.

Quadriga CX had roughly 115,000 users at the time, according to the BBC. It was believed to be one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in Canada before its collapse.

Quadriga CX said in February that the court had appointed an independent third-party monitor, EY, to oversee its creditor-protection proceedings. In April, Quadriga announced that it had entered bankruptcy proceedings.

But questions surrounding Cotten's mysterious death and rumors of mismanagement within the company began to swirl.

In June, EY said in a report that the company's ""operating infrastructure appears to have been significantly flawed from a financial reporting and operational control perspective.""

""Activities were largely directed by a single individual, Mr. Cotten, and as a result, typical segregation of duties and basic internal controls did not appear to exist,"" the monitor said.

The report added that user funds held by the company ""appear to have been used by Quadriga for a number of purposes other than to fund User withdrawals.""

The monitor said that Quadriga CX also ""failed to ensure adequate safeguard procedures were in place"" to let other executives access passwords and ""other critical operating data"" in the case of a ""critical event.""

Cotten also appeared to have taken out ""substantial funds"" from the platform that EY was unable to locate justification for, it said.

Lawyers for Cotten's widow told the BBC that she was "" heartbroken to learn of this request"" by users of the site and that her husband's death ""should not be in doubt.""","There would be more women investing in bitcoin if they had more educational materials to help them, a new report found.

According to Grayscale, women and men are not so different when it comes to their interest in cryptocurrency. The issue is education. More female investors indicated they lack familiarity with bitcoin (76 percent female vs. 52 percent male investors) but 93 percent of the women surveyed said they’d be more open to investing if they had more educational resources available to them.

Of the 1,100 people polled, 51 percent were women. The people were surveyed between March 28 and April 3, 2019. All respondents were between the ages of 25 and 64 and were involved with some form of personal investing, with at least $10,000 in household investable assets (excluding workplace retirement plans or real estate), and at least $50,000 in household income.

The survey found women were just as likely as men to see bitcoin’s high growth potential (56.2 percent of women, compared to 56.4 percent of men). They also understood bitcoin’s finite supply could drive future price increases (49.8 percent of women, 49.9 percent of men).

But the women appeared to be more risk averse, with 60 percent prioritizing financial security over building wealth. Also, 67 percent of women felt their lack of familiarity with bitcoin stopped them from investing in it, compared to 48 percent of men.

Women surveyed were also more cautious about the relative newness of the asset class. The absence of a track record was a concern noted by 65 percent of women compared to 56 percent of men.

More women than men surveyed admitted to being less savvy on investing in bitcoin, too: 44 percent of women versus 22 percent of men.

The researchers concluded that greater education could go a long way to allaying investor fears and prompting more investing into crypto. A previous Grayscale report from July found 43 percent of investors interested in bitcoin were women. The recent study found 92 percent of female investors would consider investing if bitcoin had a longer track record.

For now, crypto remains a male-dominated industry. Nearly 10 percent of bitcoin community engagement came from women in the past week, according to Coin.Dance. Quartz found nearly 85 percent of blockchain companies between 2012 and 2018 were founded by men, and a 2019 study found female developers accounted for fewer than 5 percent of the GitHub commits to the top 100 cryptocurrency projects.

Still, there is an opportunity for more women to invest in bitcoin if they had more information. According to Grayscale, 47 percent of female investors feel a stronger sense of urgency about bitcoin than men and believe now is the time to invest before prices rise; by contrast, 39 percent of men think the same way.

As one female respondent told Grayscale: “I feel like [bitcoin] has a good chance of being a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity that could pay off big.”","Two more firms - cryptocurrency mining pool Simplecoin and bitcoin gaming platform Chopcoin - are shutting down over the AMLD5 European Union regulation coming into effect Jan. 10, 2020.

A notice on the Simplecoin website reads that it is closing down on Jan. 1 because the new rules will require the firm to implement several anti-money laundering (AML) know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and it is against those to protect users' privacy.

“When the laws come into effect, we would be forced to require you, the users, to identify yourselves for anti-money-laundering purposes. Mining should be available to anyone and we refuse to jeopardize our users’ privacy,” said Simplecoin.

Christian Grieger, co-founder of Simplecoin, told The Block that the firm has 42,000 users and two employees. Grieger co-founded Simplecoin with Marvin Janssen in Aug. 2018. “Simplecoin allowed users to save mined hashes (digital points) and cash them out for any of the supported currencies, including proof of stake coins that are no longer mineable,” Grieger told The Block.

Users of Simplecoin have until Dec. 20 to withdraw their funds and until Dec. 31 to delete their account information as after this date, wallets and the entire platform will be shut down.

Another firm, bitcoin gaming platform Chopcoin, also co-founded by Grieger is shutting down for the same reason. AMLD5 imposes more stringent reporting obligations for cryptocurrency firms and authorizes Financial Intelligence Units to obtain the addresses and identities of cryptocurrency owners and users.

Grieger told The Block that he co-founded Chopcoin with Joshua Stoffels in Sept. 2015 and the firm has 305,000 users and two employees. Both Simplecoin and Chopcoin did not ever raise any funding from venture firms or investors, Grieger told The Block, adding that he has some plans for other businesses but declined to share further details.

Simplecoin and Chopcoin aren’t the only crypto firms impacted by the regulations. Just last week, cryptocurrency payments startup Bottle Pay announced that it is shutting down on Dec. 31 over AMLD5 rules, which would ""alter the current user experience so radically, and so negatively, that we are not willing to force this onto our community."" Bottle Pay announced the decision just three months after raising $2 million in a seed funding round.



More crypto firms could likely get succumbed to AMLD5 regulations.","Bitcoin has plunged by approximately 50 percent from its 2019 peak. And the cryptocurrency is hinting to continue trending downwards before the year’s close. The negative sentiment in its market, nevertheless, is benefiting rival cryptocurrencies.

That is particularly true for XTZ, the native asset of Tezos, a proof-of-stake blockchain project whose market valuation has grown twofold across the last and current financial quarters.

Since June 26 – the day bitcoin established its year-to-date (YTD) high of $14,000, the XYZ price against the benchmark cryptocurrency has surged by more than 200 percent. Meanwhile, the token’s dollar-denominated gains since the said date are well beyond 70 percent within the same timeframe.

Why Tezos is Beating Bitcoin?

‘Hype’ remains one of the most influential factors behind a cryptocurrency’s attractive price move.

The bitcoin price rallied by more than 350 percent after bottoming out near the $3,100 level last December. Part of the cryptocurrency’s huge gains appeared in the wake of the so-called safe-haven narrative. Global media reports indicated that mainstream investors treated bitcoin as a hedge against an escalating US-China trade war and dwindling yuan.

The cryptocurrency in June came to broader limelight after Facebook announced its foray into the digital currency industry. The bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate, in the same month, surged towards $14,000.

In contrast, almost all the altcoins appeared less attractive. XTZ, for instance, dropped more than 70 percent against bitcoin in the second quarter.

However, the situation flipped 180 degrees in the third quarter.

Facebook’s plans to launch a private cryptocurrency to settle global payments received flacks from regulators and lawmakers alike. As a result, investors, who had expected the social media giant to drive crypto adoption, started exiting their bitcoin positions. The sentiment drove the asset’s price downwards during the third quarter.

Around the same time, the Tezos Foundation started entering new partnerships with reputable cryptocurrency firms. The nonprofit agreed to tokenize $643 million worth of real estate in the U.K. for Overstock’s tZERO security token platform. It also lured leading cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance into offering XTZ staking services to their hundreds of thousands of customers.

XTZ Cryptocurrency Technicals Look Stronger

A string of positive developments has strengthened the XTZ’s long-term bullish bias among investors. The cryptocurrency’s moves in the past week saw it retesting its YTD high of $1.86. Before that, XTZ had already formed a Golden Cross – a perceived bullish indicator – on its daily charts, signaling traders that it has some fuel left to continue its parabolic bull run.

With bitcoin’s interim sentiments turning bearish, and Tezos providing a better bullish narrative, XTZ could be in for another leg upside.","Georgia is among one of the top cryptocurrency countries in the world; it does not have any legislative restrictions for crypto exchange and, to date, does not require any license for such activity. Also, Georgia provides a high tax certainty and beneficial tax system for businesses involved in the crypto field.

The Georgian Ministry of Finance published a public decision on June 28, 2019 (the decision) regarding taxation of cryptocurrency in Georgia. According to the decision:



individuals in Georgia are exempted from income tax on any profit received from selling cryptocurrency;

selling cryptocurrency (exchanging it into Georgian or other national currencies) is not taxable by value-added tax (VAT) (applies to both corporations and individuals);

selling computing (hash) power from Georgia abroad is not taxable by VAT either. In addition, right on input VAT on such operations is maintained (applies for both corporations and individuals);

selling computing (hash) power in Georgian territory (from a Georgian resident to a Georgian resident) is a VAT taxable operation;

purchasing computing (hash) power by a Georgian resident from abroad is subject to reverse VAT in Georgia.

Selling Cryptocurrency—Natural Persons

According to the Georgian tax code (GTC), natural persons (both, residents and nonresidents) are taxable in Georgia only on their income received from Georgian source. Specifically, personal income tax for natural persons is a worldwide income; however, GTC provides exemption on non-Georgian source income received by them while personal income tax for nonresident natural persons is only income received from Georgian source. Therefore, no worldwide taxation applies for natural persons in the country.

Article 104 of the GTC defines what types of income are considered to be received from Georgian source. The types of income of natural persons which do not meet any criteria listed in Article 104 are automatically exempt from taxation in the country.

The decision confirms that neither paragraph of Article 104 fits the profit from selling cryptocurrency, therefore, such profit shall not be deemed as being generated from a Georgian source. As a result, according to the decision, natural persons are exempted from income tax on such profit.

The criterion for residency in Georgia is to be present in the country for at least 183 days within 12 consecutive months.



Selling Cryptocurrency—Legal Entities

Legal entities are taxed on their worldwide income in Georgia, unlike natural persons. Therefore, the gain received from selling cryptocurrency by Georgian companies is subject to 15% corporate income tax (CIT).

It should be noted that Georgia has a special CIT system, similar to Estonia. In particular, Georgian companies pay no CIT on their profit annually but such tax is payable only upon the distribution of dividends and CIT is not payable unless dividends are not distributed.

In other words, if a Georgian entity decides not to distribute a profit but to reinvest it, they pay no CIT on the reinvested amount. In case of distributing dividends, 5% withholding tax on dividend applies at source in addition to 15% CIT.

It is an easy process to establish a company in Georgia. No limitations apply for foreigner shareholders and no minimum capital contribution is required. A company’s official registration can be completed in one working day after the application.



VAT and Cryptocurrency

According to Georgian tax legislation, there are two events taxable by VAT: providing goods and rendering services on Georgian territory. The VAT rate is 18%. In addition, money is not considered as a good, therefore providing money is not a VAT taxable operation.

According to the decision, selling any kind of cryptocurrency (exchanging it into Georgian or other currencies) has a similar nature as exchanging money and for VAT purposes shall be taxed in the same way as money. As a result, selling cryptocurrency shall not be regarded as a VAT taxable operation.

In summary, the decision clearly implies that selling cryptocurrency shall not be taxable by VAT in Georgia.



VAT on Selling/Purchasing Computing (Hash) Power

Process

Computing (hash) power is used for mining cryptocurrency. Miners either mine a crypto themselves and become the owner of the cryptocurrency, bearing all price fluctuation risks, or they can provide hash power to a client only and generate lower but steady income; in this case a client receives a title of owner of cryptocurrency mined via the purchased hash power. That operation is like virtually renting data centers for mining crypto coins.

Customers have an opportunity to purchase computing (hash) power platforms directly from miners or from mediator companies. The customer starts mining and generating crypto coins immediately after the purchase without owning any mining equipment. The mining period is limited according to the contract terms and it typically lasts a year. Customers have an opportunity to monitor and control their earnings on a daily basis. They usually pay a one-off fee for the service and bear all risks of price fluctuation of the crypto. The price of hash power is usually offered per TH/s (Tera Hash per Second).



Tax Consequences

In general, the service is taxable by VAT in Georgia if such service is rendered in the territory of the country. The decision states that selling hash power is considered as provision of electronic services for VAT purposes. Thus, for determining whether selling hash power has been rendered on Georgian territory we need to apply the same rules as for electronic services described in the tax code. Article 166 of the GTC separately sets rules for such services.

If the recipient and user of the electronic service is a Georgian resident, this service is considered to be provided on Georgian territory and conversely, such service is understood to be provided outside of Georgian territory if a recipient and user is a non-Georgian resident.

From the above rules we can see that selling hash power is not taxable by VAT if a Georgian resident sells it to a nonresident and it shall be taxed by reverse VAT if a Georgian resident purchases it from a nonresident. Lastly, selling hash power by a Georgian resident to a Georgian resident is taxed by VAT, which is 18%.

Due to the EU and Georgia signing an Association Agreement in June 2014, the amendments of the Georgian VAT rules will most likely be effective from 2021. However, it is expected that those amendments will not have any negative effect on the current rules of cryptocurrency VAT taxation.



Withholding Taxation

Based on Article 134 of the GTC, payment to nonresidents for services are subject to withholding taxation at a 10% rate if such income received by a nonresident is considered as being received from Georgian source, according to Article 104 of the GTC.

Article 104 is quite a long article which leaves room for interpretation and determination whether selling hash power from abroad to Georgia is Georgian source income, and it depends on specific facts and circumstances. The decision does not clarify whether that income shall be understood as Georgian source or not. Additionally, a tax treaty might prevent a Georgian company or natural person from such taxation at source, even if it is taxable based on the GTC.



Application of Tax Treaties

Georgia has a rich tax treaty network signed with 56 countries so far. Most treaties are based on the 2008 OECD or UN models. Article 7(business profit) or Article 21(other income) might apply in cases when a Georgian resident person pays to nonresidents for the hash power or vice versa.

The above-mentioned articles usually give exclusive taxing right to the resident country of service provider unless such activity creates permanent establishment in another country, which should not be the case bearing in mind the nature of such an operation (It does not require presence in other country’s territory).

Considering all of the above, in case of tax treaties’ application no withholding tax payment should be due when payment for purchased hash power is made from Georgia to abroad.

Lastly, if a natural person decides to become a Georgian resident, application of the tax treaties might prevent them from double residency in case tax administrations of other jurisdictions claim their residency as well.



Conclusion

The recent decision provides a preferential tax system especially for individuals. According to the decision:

“If a natural person becomes a resident of Georgia, he/she will not be taxed on the profit generated from selling cryptocurrency, neither VAT will be applicable on such transaction. If a legal entity established in Georgia does the same activity, no VAT is payable in that case as well but CIT of 15% and withholding tax 5% will be due only in case of distribution dividends to shareholders.”

Selling hash power is deemed a provision of electronic service and is not taxable by VAT if a Georgian resident sells it to a nonresident. However, that transaction is subject to reverse VAT in Georgia if a Georgian resident purchases hash power from abroad. In addition, 10% of withholding tax might apply on the latter transaction which might be prevented via application of a relevant tax treaty signed by the Georgian government.

2019-12-17,"There’s Bitcoin. There’s Litecoin. There’s Ethereum. So just what is cryptocurrency, and how does it work? Essentially, it’s digital money that’s bought and sold online. There’s no bills or coins. It’s not based on another asset like gold. And it doesn’t go through traditional financial institutions like banks. Instead, these currencies operate in a completely decentralized system that uses so-called blockchain technology to track transactions. To see how this works, let’s look at how you’d buy something with cryptocurrency. Say that Alice wants to buy a bike from Dan using Bitcoin, her cryptocurrency of choice. Alice begins by logging into her Bitcoin wallet with a private key, a unique combination of letters and numbers. With a traditional financial transaction, the exchanges get sent to banks on each side who record the money being subtracted from one account and added to another. But remember, in this scenario, there are no banks or middlemen. Instead, Alice’s transaction is shared with everyone in the Bitcoin network. These networked computers add Alice’s transaction to a shared list of recent transactions, known as a block. Every 10 minutes, the newest block of transactions is added on, or chained, to all the previous blocks. That’s how you get a blockchain. To ensure that each block of transactions on the chain is verified, a subset of Bitcoin’s network joins a race to solve a difficult math puzzle. And if they solve it first, their record of the block of transactions becomes the official record. They’re rewarded with Bitcoins of their own, and the network gets a new block on the chain. This entire process is known as mining. But instead of chipping away at rock, you’re solving complex puzzles. The fact that many computers are competing to verify a block ensures that no single computer can monopolize the Bitcoin market. To ensure the competition stays fair and evenly timed, the puzzle becomes harder when more computers join in. The Bitcoin protocol says mining will continue until there are 21 million Bitcoins in existence. That’s set to happen around 2140 — if Bitcoin lasts that long.","The world's biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin extended losing streak on Tuesday, slipping below the psychological $7,000 mark once again, wiping millions of dollars from the cryptocurrency market capitalisation.

The world's most widespread cryptocurrency opened higher today and touched an intraday high of $7,162.04, but soon slipped into negative terrain to touch a six months low of $6,871.92. The cryptocurrency has fallen more than 50 per cent from its 2019 high of $13,879.21 touched in June.

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets.

Bitcoin-rivals Ethereum, Ripple's XRP, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS and Binance Coin were also under selling pressure today.

As per cryptocurrency experts, there has been a steady, downward trend for months. Though, the cause for recent sell-off was not known, but analysts attributed it to decline in crypto market trading volume.

In 2019, Bitcoin rallied over 100 per cent from the yearly lows of around $3,350 in February. In June, BTC/USD touched 52-week high of $13,879. However, Bitcoin maintained a downward trajectory and hit 6-month low of $6,871 in December after several months of consolidation.

In the last 18 months, Bitcoin reported mixed performance. Bitcoin gained over 44 per cent to $9,450.68 in October this year, from $6,541.79 on July 5 last year. However, in the last two months, Bitcoin maintained a downward trajectory and slipped below $7,000 level.

Let’s talk a bit about growth and potential. The two are not always the same thing, but they both are vital for successful investing. The aim of all stock investments, after all, is to achieve growth – and that means finding stocks with the highest potential. It’s natural to gravitate toward the headline-grabbing, big-name giants; they’ve got huge market valuations, and have made their early investors very happy. But there’s an unfortunate truism in the markets, based on the iron rules of mathematics, that the larger a company gets, the less likely it is to show big returns. It’s far more likely for a $200 million company to double in value than for a $200 billion giant. And this brings us to the small-cap stocks. For investors seeking the best combination of high potential for growth and low cost of entry, the small caps may be just the ticket. We’ve used the TipRanks database to find several that fit a profile: a market cap under $400 million and a share price below $10. Even better, these small-cap tickers have Strong Buy consensus ratings from the analyst community, and boast strong upside potential. PowerFleet, Inc. (PWFL) The Internet of Things is transforming a host of industries, from factory floors to warehouses to trucking fleets. PowerFleet, the first small-cap stock we’re looking at, applies IoT and M2M tech to the security, control, tracking, and management of high-end assets, including tractor-trailers, containers, industrial trucks, and cargo, vehicle, and truck fleets. PowerFleet’s 1Q revenue was consistent with the previous quarter, and included an improvement in earnings. At the top line, the reported revenue of $29 million was only 1.3% off of Q4’s result. The 9-cent EPS loss reported was a 25% improvement from the 12-cent loss reported in the previous quarter. Year-over-year, EPS improved by 40%. Earlier this month, PowerFleet scored two major new contracts. On May 10, the company announced a 4-year contract with the Israel Police for implantation of a fleet management and driver solution system for more than 7,500 vehicles of 61 different types. The contract includes an option for a 4-year renewal. Two days later, PowerFleet announced a smaller deal with Alabama-based White Oak Transportation, to supply tracking services for the trucking company’s fleet of 850 vehicles, especially its cargo trailers. Covering PowerFleet for Canaccord, 5-star analyst Michael Walkley sees a clear path ahead for the company's continued growth. “With 600K+ subscribers, PowerFleet has the scale and international footprint to compete for global tenders against leading fleet and asset tracking competitors. For fleet management, PowerFleet is one of the only true end-to-end solutions in the market spanning in-cab, refrigerated trailers, dry vans, and containers,"" Walkley opined. The analyst added, ""We believe PowerFleet has a strong product portfolio and a leading solutions platform to grow its market share. This strength is demonstrated by its expansive global customer base… We believe PowerFleet has the leadership team in place to execute on its growth strategy and anticipate recovering sales and expanding margins as global economies recover.” To this end, Walkley rates PWFL a Buy, and his $12 price target implies a one-year upside of 84%. (To watch Walkley’s track record, click here) Overall, the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating here, based on 4 recent positive reviews, shows that Wall Street agrees with Walkley on this stock. The shares are trading for $6.51, and the average price target of $11.13 indicates a potential upside of 71% for the next 12 months. (See PWFL stock analysis on TipRanks) AXT, Inc. (AXTI) AXT is a material science company that inhabits the supply chain for the semiconductor industry. AXT develops and manufactures the high-performance rare-metal substrate wafers necessary in the construction of semiconductor chips and optoelectronic devices. AXT has operations in both California and China, staying close to Silicon Valley customers and Chinese raw materials. The company holds a vital niche in the chip industry, and its revenue and earnings have been reflecting that. In the first quarter of 2021, revenue hit $31.4 million, passing the $30 million mark for the first time on 51% year-over-year growth. EPS hit 8 cents, a dramatic turnaround from the 1-cent loss reported in the year-ago quarter. Along with the Q1 results, AXT also announced its first deliveries of 8-inch diameter gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates to a major customer. AXT has received ‘significant interest’ from potential customers of GaAs products, and predicts increasing demand as the products finds more applications. Analyst Richard Shannon, covering this stock for Craig-Hallum, takes especial note of the increasing demand for the company’s products. “The demand profile from InP (optics, health monitoring) and GaAs (5G, optics, 3DS, microLED) are as powerful as any we can find across small-cap tech. With an improving customer set (tier 1’s driving much of future growth), GM that can still grow and valuation improvement potential from a STAR exchange listing in mid-2022, investors have multiple ways to win in this stock,"" Shannon wrote. Shannon’s bullish comments back up his Buy rating, and his $17 price target suggests a 90% growth potential in the year ahead. (To watch Shannon’s track record, click here) The Wall Street reviews on AXTI break down 3 to 1 in favor of Buys versus Holds, giving the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in AXTI are selling for $8.95 each, and the average target of $16 indicates a possible upside of ~79% from that level. (See AXTI stock analysis on TipRanks) CECO Environmental (CECE) For the last stock on our list, we’ll shift to the green economy, where CECO Environmental develops, provides, and install air quality and fluid handling systems. In short, the company deals in air pollution control technology, a niche that has been in demand since the 1970s. CECO provides know-how and systems in a wide range of industries, including construction materials like bricks, cement, steel, and glass; and manufacturing, in the automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical, chemical, and fuel refining sectors. In the company’s most recent financial release, for 1Q21, the top line came in at $71.9 million, just under the $80.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter, while EPS fell from 10 cents per share one year ago to 3 cents in the current report. In more positive notes, the company reported a year-over-year increase in bookings, from $75.7 million to $92.1 million, and the work backlog of $203.1 million was up 11% from one year ago. A few days after the earnings release, CECO announced that it had won a large-scale contract with a major semiconductor chip manufacturer. The chip industry regularly works with a variety of rare metals and other pollutant chemicals – and CECO’s new contract covers scrubber and exhaust systems, as well as recirculation pumps -- items necessary for the chip maker to meet or exceed environmental regulations. Turning to the analyst community, H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal believes the company has a lot going for it and a bright future. “The company appears to be in recovery from COVID-19 headwinds, with bookings growing to $92.1M during the quarter... The last time bookings were at or above these levels was during mid-2019…. During the next few quarters, we expect to see improved revenues from Engineered Systems as the broader energy markets improve. Management highlighted that the company's bid proposal environment has been improving, with order pipeline of over $2.0B, which we believe should support continuing order improvement over the next few quarters,” the 5-star analyst explained. Based on the above, Dayal rates CECE shares a Buy rating, and his $15 price target indicates confidence in a 100% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here) Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating – this one based on 3 positive Wall Street reviews. The shares are selling for $7.50 and have a $12 average price target, suggesting a 12-month upside of 60%.

But what predictions do experts have for blockchain and cryptocurrency in 2020?

We heard from experts across the blockchain and cryptocurrency space about their predictions for 2020, from cybersecurity concerns to greater mainstream adoption.

2020 blockchain and cryptocurrency predictions

Further Bitcoin price rises

While 2019 was a transformative year for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, I believe 2020 could be even more monumental. Bitcoin was the best performing asset class by a wide margin, and this itself draws the interest of investors. It continues to unlock a global, open market for financial services during a period when many nations are closing their borders. Because of this, we would not be surprised to see the price of Bitcoin rise again.

Next year, we expect to see further expansion of global payments that do not come from legacy banking institutions. Bitcoin and other digital currencies have changed the financial landscape and shifted the way we look at all assets. The open-source ethos of cryptocurrency has put institutions on notice, and we expect all financial services to be disrupted forever.

We expect more banks to adopt the “If you can’t beat them, join them” policy in 2020. In this regard, we will also see more big names in the tech industry like Amazon coming into the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector. Every institution from Berkshire Hathaway to Barclays will be impacted by the evolution happening in these markets, and we see this trend accelerating regardless of regulation, security or price volatility.

Of course, we still see many jurisdictions pushing back on cryptocurrency through regulations, but we do believe by year-end 2020, we will see a Bitcoin ETF listed in the United States. This event could be the catalyst to push Bitcoin above $14,000.

One of the main drivers for this expectation is that similar ETFs have already been approved in Europe, and we also believe that the demand for this investment is widespread amongst traditional investors and institutional investors – we expect regulators will be willing to forge a compromise. It is worth noting that the largest accounting firms – Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG – have already adopted digital currency accounting platforms. In addition, we see the derivatives market as a stabiliser, which should also help regulators to look favourably on a Bitcoin ETF.

Quantum computing to shape future cryptocurrencies

Quantum computing will become impossible to ignore in 2020. Google just made a major breakthrough in quantum supremacy, publishing the results of a test where its 54-qubit processor performed a computation in 200 seconds that it says would have previously taken 10,000 years. The imminence of quantum computing holds major implications for the cryptocurrency industry.

Today, cryptocurrencies’ pseudo-random generation of keys leaves them susceptible to exploitation by hackers. Quantum computing increases the likelihood of predicting software-generated values, presenting major security concerns. In 2020, the first public quantum computers are coming onto the market.

With Amazon’s latest cloud service, Braket, providing quantum computers to the public, expect to see traditional blockchain networks challenged by quantum-secure networks. Quantum-secure networks, such as those that leverage quantum entanglement to generate provable random numbers and next-generation hashing algorithms, will be poised to succeed in an era of quantum computing.

While I certainly hope that the cryptocurrency market rebounds in 2020, Bitcoin may continue its struggles due to its issues with speed, scalability, and resource requirements. Bitcoin originally set out to take on legacy payment systems, but it has not successfully achieved this. Transactions on the Bitcoin network can take up to 10-15 minutes, making it ill-equipped for mainstream payments. Bitcoin also requires high entry points for network participation, which equates to massive computational power. Bitcoin has also faced issues over the last few years with scalability, which can’t be easily solved.

In 2020, I predict we will start to see other cryptocurrency payment systems gain momentum that tackle these challenges and deliver payment solutions that meets the needs of today’s global economy.

Crypto purchases with fiat

With crypto spreading to the masses, it would become easier to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with fiat money. This could be done through folks who already own crypto or through a growing network of crypto ATMs.

Just like we use our bank accounts, our crypto wallets would provide us access to cash through various crypto ATMs. As virtual currency ATMs become ubiquitous, it would be interesting to see people purchase digital assets with cash.

Also, the resistance to imposed government restrictions and other obstacles will create new DeFi-based P2P currency exchange platforms. These platforms will offer their services through mobile finance mediums and will enable any user to become an agent and exchange crypto for cash directly with their peers safely from/in any place in the world.

Alexey Ermakov, CEO and founder of Aximetria

More governments and businesses to announce their own cryptocurrencies

I predict that Facebook’s Libra will dominate the spotlight again in 2020. When Libra launched earlier this year, it not only signalled a sea change in the industry, but forced regulators to take cryptocurrency seriously. Government leaders in the United States and abroad are now wrestling with how they’ll handle blockchain technology and crypto payments as we enter a new decade.

China’s central bank is doubling down on its efforts to launch a cryptocurrency in response to Libra, and other countries may do the same. In 2020, I expect to see more governments and business leaders announce their own cryptocurrencies, and while this legitimises the industry, we must stay skeptical. Ask yourself what the motivation is behind these projects, and if they’re in it for the right reasons.

In 2019 we saw many crypto projects crash and burn. Scammers were revealed. Inexperienced teams were exposed. I predict that in 2020, the weeding out of poorly executed crypto projects will continue. We’ll see more and more cryptocurrencies that popped up in 2017 hit zero, and their teams fade away or move on to different projects. I predict 98% of crypto projects and their currencies will go to zero or have no viable exit for their holders. As the crypto ecosystem matures, every project needs to have a viable use case, strong funding, strong community, and an experienced leadership team to succeed.

While the price of Bitcoin has been a bit of a disappointment in 2019, I think Bitcoin’s halving in May could spike the price. I expect to see Bitcoin reach $11,000 around this time. The communities that believe in Bitcoin will continue to HODL, regardless of price fluctuations, and by now it’s clear that Bitcoin has proven itself as a long-term investment and store of value.

I would further venture to say Bitcoin will hit $2m a coin in the next 5 years so long as the core dev team doesn’t destroy it accidentally from within, causing a crypto catastrophe and pushing the entire crypto ecosystem from decentralised freedom into government-backed cryptos that they will feel safer in.

Cryptojacking to climb with price hikes

Cryptojacking will move in line with cryptocurrency prices. If prices increase, we’ll see more cryptomining; as they fall, attackers will find other monetisation strategies.

As people move to more locked down devices, cryptojacking will become increasingly prevalent, monetising threats through the consumer’s electricity bill.

2020s to be a decade of blockchain innovation and adoption

Cryptocurrencies have arguably been the radical fintech innovation of the decade. In less than a decade, blockchain and crypto tech has unleashed a wave of innovation and ideas for the future of finance and payments. As we complete 10 years of bitcoin, its value has increased from $0.03 in March 2010 to its current value of $6,000 (November 2019). However, the spike to $20,000 in 2017 due to an investor frenzy will not be forgotten and although it may not see these heights in the short-term we could expect more investor interest throughout the course of the next decade.

In addition, this year’s hearing surrounding Facebook and its entry has certainly paved the way for further interesting developments. It was more of a timing issue, as Facebook already under the public eye for privacy issues, came out with radical plans for its crypto token that immediately raised fears in EU and US governments that the Libra would circumvent monetary sovereignties.

Under an increasingly liberal China, which is backing a digital Yuan under hopes of furthering a worldwide adoption, a blanket regulatory approach from the west would handover digital supremacy to China and led to a splinternet model.

While the 2010s has been an exploratory phase – introducing the concepts of crypto tokens and blockchain to the world, the 2020s will be the decade for innovation and application. Stable currencies like the BOLT Token, which is backed by a real world application and utility will yield actual value.

Supply chain blockchain applications to bring measurable benefits

Firms will gain measurable benefits from blockchain in conjunction with IoT and AI in logistics use cases.

Today, supply chain transactions are coordinated across multiple parties, and spread across multiple geographies and legal jurisdictions. Some of these parties will be organisations; some will be individuals; and some may be automated, network-connected devices. Solutions that leverage blockchain in conjunction with IoT, and potentially AI, will cut supply chain costs and boost CX through seamless logistics.

The IoT device: Tracks and sensors the products, providing answers to questions such as: Where is the product? Was it too hot or cold? (particularly useful when transporting food) Is it genuine? Each connected device acts as a node on the blockchain network, authenticating the transaction and providing an immutable record.

The AI is the learning system; it looks at the behavior of the component over time across the ecosystem, correlates with other data points (weather, market data), then makes prescriptive recommendations OR automates decisions. Smart contracts built into the blockchain give the ability to execute code autonomously, which is ideal in an ecosystem environment, when many parties interact but have a limited relationship (and therefore trust) with one another.

However, utopian vision of enterprises across industries migrating all their processes onto shared blockchains, and interacting on a trusted ecosystem, still seems far-fetched. Blockchain projects that are not narrow in focus continuously run into problems with scaling. Businesses continue to start with a desire for blockchain, rather than the business problem, which is often solvable without the need for distributed ledger technology.

Helena Schwenk, global analyst relations manager at Exasol

Blockchain to be integrated into business models

Blockchain’s moment in the mainstream is just around the corner and 2020 will be the year where it will be implemented into business models in a variety of ways. Take Coca-Cola for example, the company is set to adopt blockchain technology to manage its cross-part transactions.

The payment space is set to be revamped; In the igaming industry for example a blockchain payment system will streamline the entire gaming experience – strengthening trust between players and gaming providers through transparent data storage.”

No matter the industry, through blockchain, positive changes can be made and 2020 will be the year these changes will begin to have an effect on a wider audience.

Bitcoin’s safe-haven status will be put to the test

Typically, when investors want to defend their portfolios against future volatility, they buy so-called ‘safe haven’ assets which benefit during times of economic turmoil, such as gold, US treasuries, or the Japanese Yen.

But what about bitcoin as a safe-haven asset? This will be a question that will be increasingly discussed (if not tested) in 2020.

On the one hand, bitcoin is still an extremely volatile asset with 5-10% daily price swings still commonplace, and as such is naturally considered as a high risk investment under normal considerations. As such we would expect it to be subject to the same ‘risk-on, risk-off’ investor sentiment as other high risk assets such as equities or options/derivatives.

On the other hand, bitcoin has consistently shown that is in fact uncorrelated with most traditional financial asset classes. This is quite an interesting property which means that bitcoin’s price doesn’t necessarily follow other asset classes off the cliff when there is a large market downturn. As such, uncorrelated assets are popular tools with investors to hedge their portfolios.

Being an uncorrelated, censorship-resistant asset, it’s quite possible that bitcoin will increasingly adopt the identity of a safe-haven; a lifeboat for capital when the wider markets go sour. But it’s also possible that, when it comes down to the crunch, it will be dumped along with other high risk assets in favour of traditional safe-havens. I suspect the former, although it really depends if bitcoin has had enough time to acquire investors comfort and safe-haven identity before this is put to the test.

Signs of a crypto spring

It is always difficult to predict where immature technology and economic activity might go. However, there are signs that we are entering a ‘crypto spring’ with well-funded projects, blockchain patents and a maturing of the crypto space.

Bitcoin, as a deflationary currency, will continue to appreciate in value longer term and other cryptocurrencies that seek to act as a store of value will follow this path. There will also be a clearer distinction between forms of cryptocurrencies as payment tokens, utility tokens, asset tokens and security tokens. The market will become increasingly sophisticated to understand the differences, assisted by greater regulatory scrutiny and clarification.

Blockchain and other forms of distributed ledger technology will start to be applied as solutions to genuine problems, albeit in a more limited form than prophesised by blockchain evangelists rather than as solutions looking for a problem to solve (or worse, fabricating a problem to which someone’s blockchain was the magic solution).

There will continue to be bull and bear runs as the crypto ecosystem matures. However, at the same time, the magnitude of the runs will tend to settle down as the market becomes more sophisticated and regulatory oversight starts to increasingly bite.

Will crypto replace centralised financial systems? Not anytime soon. Governments and incumbent financial institutions have taken the momentum out of the original drive that built up between 2009 and 2017. These large actors have ingested that same momentum and are now looking at how they use crypto technology to augment (if not entrench) existing financial systems.

The gap between regulated and unregulated will grow

Regulation in its own right is likely to be one of the prevailing blockchain trends in 2020. January will mark the formal arrival of Liechtenstein’s Blockchain Act, one of the most advanced regulatory regimes for the industry in the world – one that balances support for innovation with importance advances in customer and asset protection.

Where Liechtenstein is leading, others are set to eventually follow. And this will mark the shift of the blockchain, and specifically cryptocurrency, market from an unregulated one which has attracted a justifiably poor reputation in some corners, to the kind of regulated industry that can provide a stable home for investor capital. Next year is when we expect this trend to accelerate, and the gap between regulated and unregulated exchanges to become much more distinct.

Cryptojacking continues

Cryptojacking is becoming a widespread problem in the industry and will continue to be as we move into 2020. Cryptojacking is where malware gets implanted on a device with the sole purpose of mining cryptocurrency for the hacker.

It seems that criminals have discovered it’s easier to host Cryptojacking malware on machines to mine cryptocurrency rather than trying to execute traditional ransomware attacks. While not as devastating as other attacks, nefarious cryptomining malware on a device will steal CPU processing resources leading to a slowdown in performance and extra drain on battery powered devices – resulting in a shorter lifespan of the affected device. It can also lead to unexpected costs if running on a paid for cloud service.

Very few would agree to this, but it must be noted that there is a move by online sites to ‘legitimately’ ask users to lend their CPUs for mining while visiting that website, primarily as a payment mechanism. This has arisen in part due to the widespread adoption of ad blockers. Cryptomining, on the other hand, occurs when users are tricked into downloading executables or they visit hijacked sites where ads run cryptomining scripts.

To minimise the risk of a cryptomining breach ad blockers should be installed, anti-virus software put in place and Javascript disabled. In addition, enterprises must train staff about the dangers of clicking on links and visiting illegitimate websites. Staff should also be trained to look for a slowdown in performance and how to examine running processes.

Growing industry adoption of blockchain

The blockchain market is still fairly new, so that means there’s a lot of opportunity for new ideas and growth within this area. Blockchain will be used predominately by the financial sector for cybersecurity, this is one of the leading areas, particularly when it comes remittance and money transfers because of distributed ledger technology.

In financial services, we see areas like alternative currency exchanges, asset management, insurance and even crowdfunding using blockchain technology more and more. The prevailing use for blockchain at this moment is for mobile wallets, such a virtual currency and universal payment systems.

Other areas where blockchain is set to grow includes identity management, authenticity related to security use, and infrastructure. However, blockchain and DLT solutions have come under fire in the recent times, so there is still huge uncertainty in this area. Blockchain needs to prove its role by engaging with enterprises and providing more use-cases to reach that next level.

Criminal interest in the Monero cryptocurrency

We expect to see further increasing cybercriminal interest in Monero, the privacy and anonymity-centric cryptocurrency, as part of a gradual shift away from Bitcoin (BTC) towards other cryptocurrencies that can’t be as easily tracked.

This may partially be a result of law enforcement takedowns as well as self-imposed shutdowns of Bitcoin tumblers in 2019. These interruptions underscored the cybercriminal dependency on these services – which are critical in BTC money-laundering operations – and which are less imperative with a coin like Monero.

Many cryptojackers also now mine Monero due in part to the fact that it’s privacy centric and thus highly attractive to criminals; we see the most intense interest in Monero in the English language underground.

Blockchain will start to shake up supply chains in 2020

Use of Blockchain to solve supply chain sustainability and compliance challenges will move from proofs of concept and pilot efforts to full fledge deployments in 2020 driven by large global brands with well-defined supply chains. The projects that get funded will be those that have proven return like provenance tracking, contract compliance, supplier diversity and ethical sourcing. Separately, these same companies along with others with more fluid supply chain, will begin building out industry consortiums to identify industry wide challenges that blockchain can address. Early movers will be the food, manufacturing and pharma industries.

The end of optimistic experimentation

Optimistic experimentation comes to an end as we reach 2020. We’ll see new challenges arise from the fact that these experiments are nearing adulthood. The most promising of these applications continues to be exchanges of information and rich automated workflows between co-operative and sometimes competitive organisations, and government bodies. To date, these players’ best interest is to collaborate, as these companies achieve a robust understanding and familiarity with the technology. We predict that these mutual incentives of learning will be outweighed by more competitive desires. We will see organisations now try to break the limits of these systems in more oppositional ways.

Blockchain and contract law battle it out in the courts: which wins practically, a paper contract or an immutable smart contract? Enterprise blockchains aren’t so immutable, as blockchain endeavors suffer and recover from mundane events like software bugs or dramatic ones stemming from malicious participants; we’ll see how hardline each system is to immutability guarantees.

On a positive note, blockchain platforms continue to evolve and mature in how they see their role in security. This maturity is marked by attention to how people will use the platforms, rather than the security of the platforms themselves.

We see this manifest as attention in the field to smart contract security analysis technologies that can reason about smart contract code, investments in smart contract programming languages that are easier for developers and tools to reason about (and have formal ‘safety’ properties), and programming platforms that provide safety to end users by moving closer to workloads that organisations care about – and providing security out of the box.

Blockchain to boost sustainable investments

Green finance, defined as the integrating of environmental protection with economic profits, is gaining traction within the financial industry and will continue to in 2020. Blockchain-enabled platforms and processes manage complex transactions more efficiently and will improve the transparency, traceability and cost-effectiveness of sustainable investments. As a result, sustainable development and other climate-related initiatives will be more attractive for investors.

Smart contracts, a key element of blockchain technology, increase autonomy and speed of execution for financial transactions, enabling task automation and minimising cash trapped in the value chain of a transaction. This will help financial institutions conduct green finance trade internationally, increasing global cooperation and further cementing the global dedication to climate action.

Blockchain technology displays very promising solutions to facilitate and accelerate sustainable investments. Well beyond the buzz around cryptocurrencies, the tech community is truly inspired at participating in a more sustainable world, which requires much more transparency, accountability and sense of emergency.

There will be an uptick in cryptojacking

2019 saw a decline in cryptojacking—secretly using someone’s computing power to carry out the cryptomining task. This decline was not surprising because the price of cryptocurrency has also decreased following its zeitgeist moment in 2018. However, recently, cryptocurrency prices have been creeping up.

They will likely move past the breakeven point for currency miners, i.e., the point where it is once again profitable to run cryptojacking campaigns. With successful miners able to go undetected for months, this is an issue that is likely to linger throughout the year, making it essential for organisations to monitor for these threats actively.

Blockchain to rise again?

The blockchain is unquestionably an ingenious invention, but has gone through what Gartner calls in their hypercycles as the trough of disillusionment. It promised much but has delivered very little to date. Ever since it emerged as the ‘next big thing’, there have been very few meaningful applications for blockchain in the real world.

So, what’s holding blockchain back from mainstream adoption? There are a few elements here, but broadly speaking it comes down to cost, scalability and trust.

With industry leaders, such as Amazon or Microsoft committing to building services around blockchain, we will begin to see accelerated adoption as they tackle the issues that have previously stopped it making its way into the mainstream – with real-world solutions coming into play from 2020.

Aaron Harris, CTO at Sage

A greater focus on blockchain applications

There is little doubt in my mind that blockchain is evolving at some speed. The language has changed positively from ‘What is it?’ to discussing the implementation of usage cases without getting het-up about the technology. Yes, there are still occasional entertaining forays and debates on the relative merits of Turing complete vs non-Turing complete languages, but these types of discussion tend to be very much limited to the inner workings of IT departments rather than the boardroom.

My prediction for 2020 is that the technology itself will become even less of a feature in the discussions and there will be more of a focus on application. I’d see this as a very healthy evolution as it would show the move from concept to implementation.

In particular, I expect we will see an increasing use of smart contracts alongside traditional contracts beyond the small scale proof of concepts and pilots we have seen to date, and developing into operational reality. I would also expect to see usage cases include increasing adoption of blockchain for chain-of-custody transfers to improve supply chain transparency, and a wider adoption of the technology in tracking transfer of ownership.

The less we talk about blockchain technology as a ‘thing’ in its own right, the more I expect it will become part of the technology furniture.

Iain Steel, chief procurement services officer at TLT

Beyond disruption

2020 is the year we will see blockchain move past the ‘disruptive’ phase and into our daily lives. This could mean integration with everyday tech such as health records and smoke detectors, as well as a possible integration with many sectors, such as sensors and IoT, digital access, authentication of data, and digital identities especially.

It could also play a role in the rise of smart cities. Take pollution control for example. With growing global fears around climate change, how we manage our cities is becoming ever more important. Blockchain can facilitate better urban planning and solve pertinent problems like waste, congested traffic and population growth with more data.

Asia will also remain at the forefront of innovation in blockchain, with China’s digital currency set to be rolled out next year. Given the potential of digital assets, this move could be check-mate for China in the trade war against the US. Singapore is also leading the world at the moment in terms of being a conducive environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. In fact, as of February 2019, over 634 companies were incorporated in Singapore with a combined market cap of approximately $8.3bn.

While change will always have detractors, the truth is that, thanks to the involvement of governments and institutions around the world, we’re already well on the way to mainstream acceptance of crypto. And as global governments start racing to launch their own cryptocurrencies in order to keep up with the big tech corporations, this trend is set to accelerate.

Changing technologies, growing applications

Making predictions is a difficult business, but there are a number of areas that have garnered increased interest over the past 6 months within the blockchain sphere that we will see develop over the course of 2020.

Firstly, progress will be made within infrastructure building with the move to Ethereum 2.0, that is moving away from a proof-of-work system of transaction validation to proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake is expected to be more scalable and energy efficient than proof-of-work, so this will help address those scalability issues in the most popular smart contract ecosystem.

Resource tokens will be an extension to the sharing economy but on the infrastructure/resource level. Why pay AWS if we can use each other’s resources?

We will see increasing popularity and adoption of DeFi products (decentralised finance) such as open financial tools. These include payments, credit & lending, decentralised exchanges and other DeFi products such as hedging, shorting, derivative trading and prediction markets.

Gaming and digital collectibles: blockchain based video games and digital collectibles. We’re yet to see the first successful gaming application in 2020. No major application of Blockchain in gaming has been seen yet, but many projects are working on it following investment in 2019.

Read more: Data privacy predictions for 2020: Six industry experts have their say","Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the bestsellers ""The Black Swan” and “Fooled By Randomness,” is optimistic about cryptocurrencies.

“You cannot ignore the cryptocurrencies, particularly the bitcoin story and blockchain,” Taleb said at Times Networks’ India Economic Conclave on Tuesday. The Lebanese-American author believes that people of some countries, such as Lebanon, have “lost faith” in governments and banking systems.

“I am realizing Lebanon is in a situation where there is an implied currency control but the government cannot control bitcoin which is a good thing because people have no trust and the ability of the central bank which really causes the ponzi style collapse and the bitcoin does not have that,” said Taleb.

Bitcoin is “winning,” according to the 59-year-old author, and currency without government is “great.” Taleb further said that he has an institute, which now accepts payments in bitcoin.

“I am very glad that we have cryptocurrencies...Of course, you are going to have frauds and ponzi schemes and all that with bitcoin and cryptos but when you see governments like in Lebanon, doing the ponzis you tell yourself what is better,” he said.

This is not the first time the author has had a positive stance on cryptocurrencies. In response to a news story about capital controls imposed by Lebanese banks, he recently tweeted: “The most potent case for cryptocurrencies: banks are never there when you need them. And they are trying to bully the public so they avoid accountability and profit disbursements. Bankers are legal crooks.”","Fidelity Investments, one of the world’s largest asset managers, is setting up a new entity to serve European institutional investors in digital assets.

The firm said Tuesday the new business will be provided through Fidelity Digital Asset Services (FDAS), its New York state-chartered limited liability trust company. Launched in 2018, FDAS already offers custody and trade execution services services to U.S.-based institutional investors.

It will now also provide European digital assets investors such as hedge funds, family offices and market intermediaries with these services, Fidelity said in press release shared with CoinDesk.

The firm has appointed Chris Tyrer as the head of FDAS in Europe. Tyrer previously worked as a managing director at Barclays Investment Bank. leading its digital asset project. He’s also served as global head of commodities trading for the bank following a long career in the traditional financial markets. In the new role. Tyrer will lead client service activity in the region.

The firm recently made significant progress in the U.S. FDAS bagged a New York Trust Charter to custody bitcoin for institutions in November and said at the time it would onboard its first client by the end of 2019.

Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, said the firm has seen “significant interest and engagement” from institutional investors since its U.S. launch a year ago.","Crypto derivatives platform ErisX is officially live with its physically settled bitcoin futures contracts, launching only the second such product suite in the U.S.

The company announced in a market notice Monday that its “Futures Digital Currency Products” would begin trading Tuesday, starting 8:00 a.m. Central Time (14:00 UTC). The marketplace’s daily trading hours run to 4:00 p.m. CT (22:00 UTC). In a pair of announcements shared exclusively with CoinDesk, the company elaborated on its new products, noting they would be trading alongside the company’s existing crypto spot exchange.

ErisX is only the second company to offer physically settled bitcoin futures in the U.S., following the launch of Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt futures contracts in September of this year. Cash-settled futures have been trading in the U.S. since 2017, when CME and Cboe launched their own products, though Cboe discontinued its bitcoin futures earlier this year.

According to a product page posted Monday, ErisX’s bitcoin futures will see a contract size of 0.1 bitcoin ($663 at current prices), with customers able to trade monthly or quarterly contracts at launch. Traders will have a position limit of 200,000 contracts and a minimum price increment of $1 per bitcoin (or $0.10 per contract).

While ErisX’s futures market is opening Tuesday, investors will not be able to participate through futures commission merchants or brokerages until early next year. A specific date has not yet been announced.

“We know that growth in open interest will take time and there are clear challenges ahead,” the company said in a blog post. “Introducing an intermediary market is a multi-step process, not an event, and our experience with such launches has taught us to build for longevity.”

Early adopters

Wedbush Securities is one such futures commission merchant that will participate in the marketplace, according to a statement by Wedbush executive vice president Bob Fitzsimmons.

“ErisX has taken many steps to build out their intermediary-friendly model for digital assets including the consideration of how many FCMs manage back-office processes through FIS,” he said.

ErisX currently offers spot trading services in 44 different U.S. states, with plans to add another five states and four territories (Hawaii is not on this list).

In a statement, ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas said the company met “aggressive goals” in raising funds and building out its team, as well as with developing its matching engine and futures clearing system.

“After the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) granted us a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) license this summer, we have been focused on our offering and are thrilled to be ending the year with the launch of our futures market,” Chippas said.

Eris Exchange, a derivatives market provider founded in 2010, unveiled ErisX in October 2018, announcing the new crypto unit had received backing from major retail brokerage TD Ameritrade. Fidelity, Bitmain, ConsenSys and Nasdaq also participated in later funding rounds.

The company secured the regulatory licenses needed to offer futures products in the U.S. through 2018 and 2019, including its derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license in July.

ErisX will see small amounts of competition at launch, with only Bakkt offering a similar product at present. While fellow derivatives provider LedgerX is working to offer bitcoin futures products, the CFTC has yet to approve a final license for the company.","Every once in a while, in certain countries and cultures, new words are added to the lexicon: Brexit, fake news, crypto. In Venezuela, bitcoin and hyper-inflation are perhaps two of the most mentioned words in daily conversation. The country’s economy has been nose-diving since President Nicolás Maduro came to power in 2013, but it has now reached unprecedented lows.

The International Monetary Fund says inflation of the Venezuelan bolivar is expected to hit a startling 200,000 per cent this year. A cup of coffee that cost 150 bolivars in November 2018 now costs 18,000 bolivars. A university professor earning 2.5 million bolivars a month makes just enough to buy about one kilo of meat or a dozen eggs with each paycheck.

Christopher Sabatini, senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, describes the situation as “the worst economic and humanitarian crisis in the world, in which there has never been a war”.

Throughout history, people in certain places have undergone a process which economists like to call the “discovery of advantages of backwardness”. They take techniques that have worked well in more advanced parts of the world and apply them in less developed regions. The changes they introduce make those techniques work so well that a region, which was once the periphery, becomes a centre in its own right. In Venezuela, fintech, and more specifically cryptocurrency, is increasingly popular.

Fintech and financial inclusion

Unlike traditional money, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are built on a decentralised electronic ledger called blockchain . The ledger isn’t controlled by a central bank or finance ministry, but by multiple users around the globe running “nodes”, or copies of the entire ledger, on their computers, which can’t be cut off or censored.

More than the economic and political crisis, a feeling of distrust has permeated every level of Venezuelan society. People are looking for ways to operate outside the system just to buy goods and services. There are stories of employees leaving their office jobs to stand in line under the hot sun in supermarket queues, so they can buy produce to be sold on the black market, where they can make more money than having a regular nine to five. Choosing cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in Venezuela over the bolivar is just another survival strategy.

“There is a lot of cryptocurrency going on, but it’s not very open, like you would have in the United States and other countries,” says Steven Malca, president of the South America Initiative, a US-based NGO providing humanitarian aid. “The [Venezuelan] government hasn’t outlawed cryptocurrency per se, but they prefer people to use something they call the petro.”

Venezuela’s petro national cryptocurrency was launched by President Maduro in October 2018 as an alternative to the ever-declining bolivar. It is supposed to be backed by Venezuela’s rich oil reserves, but as with anything backed by the government in Caracas, the petro has failed to take off. Critics say it is another government ruse to circumvent international sanctions. More importantly, the average Venezuelan, more concerned about where their next meal is coming from, just doesn’t know enough about it.

Can cryptos save the day?

“You have to educate people,” says Mr Malca. “In the United States and Europe, we are able to sit down and research about these things. In Venezuela, the average internet connection is a quarter of a megabyte or one megabyte at the most. People still don’t have access to this type of information and they are afraid to use something that is not tangible.”

And yet, amid the chaos and lack of information, there is evidence cryptocurrency is making some sort of difference.

“When we give people crypto, we also set up stores which accept payments in crypto and have cash-out partners so they can exchange crypto for cash,” says Joe Waltman, executive director of GiveCrypto, a non-profit that distributes cryptocurrency to people in poverty. “When we track a number of impact metrics, such as food security and the psychological wellbeing of the people we give crypto to, we see significant statistical improvement in both of those areas; they are eating more and feeling much less stressed when receiving our aid.”

Even cryptocurrency isn’t immune to market volatility, however. Two years ago there was a sort of bitcoin frenzy, triggering wild price fluctuations throughout the market. Cryptocurrencies are an attractive censor-proof tool for remittances, but volatility can make crypto tokens a dangerous medium for transfers and savings. In a country where people’s daily lives are dictated by the value of their currency, the last thing needed is another element of uncertainty.

Confidence, trust and credibility

On one hand, cryptocurrency has allowed some Venezuelans with access to computers, knowhow and blockchain technology to receive money from their family and friends abroad. On the other hand, the system is still far from inclusive.

“At times, it can be highly discriminatory,” says Dr Sabatini. “The very poor don’t have access to online accounts or relatives living abroad. So while crypto is helpful it is not a magic bullet.”

Historically, successful economies have always been propped up by two pillars: confidence and trust. When things go as they should, people feel confident to invest and buy things. When times get tough, there is still trust that institutions will be up to the challenge.

At the most fundamental level, the problem in Venezuela is one of credibility. All over the world, people living under oppressive regimes have found ways to get on with life, in many cases with the help of technology. In Venezuela, crypto in the form of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies might provide a beacon of hope, but they won’t be the solution.

“The linchpin of monetary stability is confidence,” says Dr Sabatini. “At every turn, Maduro’s government has demonstrated its partisanship, its corruption, its lack of transparency and its willingness to manipulate fiscal, currency and monetary policy. People’s reserve of confidence has evaporated and it’s going to take another government to restore that, regardless of developments in the fintech industry.",
2019-12-18,"A cryptocurrency exchange based in the U.K. is delisting Ethereum in 2020, focusing exclusively on offering access to BTC.

Effective January 3, 2020, Financial Conduct Authority-licensed exchange Coinfloor will no longer offer access to Ethereum trading, in a significant blow for the cryptocurrency and its profile in the U.K.

According to an announcement from the exchange, all deposits, buying and selling activity will cease on this date. However, users will still be able to withdraw or store Ethereum with Coinfloor beyond the deadline, albeit at a greater cost.

Obi Nwosu, founder and CEO of Coinfloor, said the decision to delist Ethereum comes at a time of waning relevance for the cryptocurrency amongst developers and users. Nwosu said the real aim of crypto should be creating the world’s new money, supporting both operators and developers in building the next generation of financial services.

“The ecosystem of businesses and consumers using or holding bitcoins is growing every day as more people start to recognise its worth. Coinfloor has the opportunity to create financial services that not only meet the…ecosystem’s needs, but also contribute to making this future form of money available to everyone.”

However, Nwosu recognised that other cryptocurrencies still have a role to play: “That being said, we continually look to identify other cryptocurrencies that provide a differentiated proven value proposition, have a strong capable community of supporters, and maintain a focus on decentralisation and censorship resistance.”

The decision to drop Ethereum comes at a time when a growing number of developers are moving to Bitcoin SV. While BTC remains the dominant cryptocurrency worldwide based on market cap, BSV is becoming the developer protocol of choice. This month, BSV has eclipsed ETH in daily transactions. With faster transaction speeds, lower costs and superior developer infrastructure to both BTC and Ethereum, Bitcoin SV is the only cryptocurrency adhering to the original whitepaper version of bitcoin.

These futures, made available by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, are no longer tradable.

On December 17 that same year, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched its bitcoin futures.

The goal of these cash-settled products had been made clear in November 2017.

According to the CME’s Leo Melamed, cash-settled futures would “tame” bitcoin. “We’ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules.” – said Melamed in an interview with Reuters.

In this article, we will take a look at:

What futures are and how they managed to “tame” bitcoin.

How to trade futures. More precisely, how to trade bitcoin and cryptocurrency futures.

Where you should trade these speculative derivatives.

What Are Bitcoin Futures? How Do They Work?

A bitcoin futures contract enables its owner to buy bitcoin for a set price, at a specified point in the future.

At the time of writing, the price of one bitcoin is around $7.2k. You are a bull and believe the price will go up to $10k by the end of the year. It thus makes perfect sense to you to enter a futures contract, that would compel the other party to sell you bitcoin for $8k at that time.

At the end of the year, you may choose to buy the specified amount of bitcoin for $8k/BTC. If cash-settled, the contract allows you to pocket the difference between the price and the price agreed in the contract.

When you trade cash-settled futures, you do not handle (buy/sell/hold) any bitcoin at all.

If you believe the price will drop to $5k, you can enter a futures contract in that direction instead. Such a contract would give you the right to sell bitcoin for $6k at that time.

How to Trade Futures

With futures contracts, you can go Long or Short.

When you believe that the price of an asset will go up, you enter a contract that reflects your bullish stance. You go Long. This contract allows you to Buy bitcoin in the future, at a predetermined price.

If you assume the price will drop, you go Short. You enter a contract that will allow you to Sell bitcoin in the future.

Knowing how to trade futures is undoubtedly useful. You should also know why to trade them. What advantages do they offer over simply buying, holding, and selling digital assets?

The value swings of futures are much more significant than those of the underlying asset. You may also be able to use leverage to increase risk/profitability.

Bitcoin futures allow you to make money on bitcoin price downswings.

Where to Trade Bitcoin Futures

Knowing where to trade is just as important as knowing how to trade futures. It’s important to find a trustworthy exchange with good security and an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. Just as important is making sure that your trading profits aren’t all eaten up by fees. Do a little research before you begin trading to make sure you’ve chosen a platform that will work well for you.","View

Bitcoin has found acceptance under the three-day chart's 200-period average for the first time in seven months.

The breakdown may attract stronger selling pressure, yielding a slide below the November low of $6,500.

A minor bounce to $6,800 may be seen before a deeper slide, with the intraday charts reporting oversold conditions.

A UTC close above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870 is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal.

Bitcoin risks dropping to seven-month lows below $6,500, having found acceptance under a key long-term price support.

The top cryptocurrency by market value fell by 6.33 percent in the three days to Dec. 17 (data from Bitstamp), erasing almost the entire corrective bounce from $6,500 to $7,870 witnessed in the last week of November.

More importantly, the three-day candle, representing the price action for Dec. 15-17, closed below the 200-period moving average (MA) – a level considered a barometer of the long-term market trend.

That’s the first time the 200 MA has been breached since May. Bitcoin now faces stronger selling pressure and could see a drop below the November low of $6,511.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $6,640 on Bitstamp, representing a 3 percent decline on a 24-hour basis. The three-day 200-period MA is lined up at $6,948.

3-day chart

Bitcoin’s previous three-day candle closed well below the 200-period MA, unlike the hammer candle witnessed in late November, which printed lows below the average support but closed higher.

The latest breakdown of the major support is backed by a bearish below-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI) and descending 5- and 10-period MAs. Further, the 5- and 200-period MAs look set to produce the first bear cross since October 2018.

The chart also shows that cryptocurrency is trapped in a five-month falling channel, meaning the broader market trend is also bearish.

Thus, the odds appear stacked in favor of a violation at $6,500 (November low). That would expose the next support at $6,378 ( Nov. 3, 2018 high).

It’s worth noting that bitcoin has already retracted 50 percent of the rally from December 2018 lows near $3,100 to the June 2019 high of $13,880.

Daily chart

The RSI has dropped below 30, but is holding well above the low of 22 registered in November. Put simply, there’s room for a deeper price slide.

The MACD histogram is beginning to produce deeper bars below the zero line – a sign the downside move is gathering traction.

A UTC close above $7,870 is needed to invalidate the bearish lower highs set up and confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

Hourly and 4-hour charts

The RSI on the hourly chart has risen from oversold territory, signaling scope for a price bounce. The 4-hour chart RSI is also indicating oversold conditions.","Lukka, which makes blockchain products for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, has debuted a do-it-yourself tax preparation product for taxpayers reporting cryptocurrency assets on IRS Forms 1040 and 8949.

LukkaTax will be available for the 2019 tax season. LukkaTax was developed in partnership with CPA.com, the technology arm of the American Institute of CPAs. The alliance, announced in December, will first focus on building crypto asset solutions specifically for accounting firms and sole practitioners to support taxpayers who prefer to work with CPA firms, rather than handle tax preparation needs themselves. The first product released under the alliance is the virtual currency tax preparation tool, LukkaTax for Professionals . Practitioners purchase and use the tool to complete crypto data processes not supported by their existing tax preparation software solutions.



The new DIY software, available mid-January, leads taxpayers through a guided experience so they can calculate taxable gain or loss on crypto investments. LukkaTax evolved from LibraTax, Lukka’s commercial crypto tax calculator released in 2014, and is built to complete crypto data collection, enrichment, and calculation processes not supported by traditional tax preparation software solutions.

2019 will be the first year that the IRS will explicitly ask taxpayers to document their cryptocurrency — or ""virtual currency,"" as the IRS calls it — activity, prioritizing this question to the top of its new IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1. For those with cryptocurrency activity, transactional details must be itemized on IRS Form 8949 which includes cost basis, proceeds, and itemized gain or loss. If taxpayers did not report their crypto from previous years, it can be done so now by amending prior year returns, which can be done via LukkaTax.

Lukka offers other crypto-focused products that complement its DIY tax prep product. Lukka Prime is a fair market, value-based crypto asset pricing methodology; and Lukka Reference Data eliminates inconsistencies between constantly changing crypto ticker and pair mappings traded across various crypto exchange platforms.

“Lukka is bringing institutional-grade tax preparation products to all consumers with scalable and secure tools that have guided experiences and are incredibly easy to use,” said Jake Benson, founder and CEO of Lukka, in a statement. “Considering the intense IRS focus on compliance and lack of accuracy in prior year reporting, we believe that the do-it-yourself taxpayer requires a purpose-built crypto tax product they can trust will comply with IRS requirements; LukkaTax meets that need.”","An alleged teen crook stole the identities of 75 people and swiped $1 million in cryptocurrency — all from the comfort of his Brooklyn apartment, authorities said.

Yousef Selassie, 19, used a sophisticated SIM-swapping scheme to take over the phones of people in 20 different states between Jan. 20 and May 19, 2019, according to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.

He allegedly transferred his victims’ phone numbers to his own iPhones, enabling him to reset their passwords and gain access to their Gmail, cryptocurrency and other accounts. Meanwhile, his victims’ phones would suddenly go offline.

The stolen $1 million came from just two victims, authorities said. Selassie was arrested Dec. 5 in Corona, California, and extradited to New York.

He was arraigned Wednesday in Manhattan Supreme Court, where he pleaded not guilty to 87 counts of grand larceny, identity theft and other charges. Justice Mark Dwyer ordered him to surrender his passport and check in weekly with a supervised release program. The judge did not set bail.

Authorities executed search warrants on Selassie’s Brooklyn and California residences, where they seized half a dozen iPhones, two Rolex watches, a monogrammed Gucci wallet and numerous pieces of high-end jewelry, according to court papers.","In January, the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga announced that its CEO and founder Gerald Cotten had passed away a month earlier from complications of Crohn’s disease while on honeymoon in India. Quadriga was, at one point, Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange and processed billions of dollars in trades. Cotten’s death, however, revealed a critical flaw in the cryptocurrency giant’s infrastructure: He was the only person who had access to the $180 million of cryptocurrency that its users held in their accounts. Some of Quadriga’s traders are now alleging that Cotten might have faked his death in order to abscond with their funds. Lawyers representing these traders sent a letter to Canadian law enforcement on Friday asking to exhume the body in Cotten’s grave to perform an autopsy.

This, obviously, raises lots of questions about how a crypto CEO might have gone about faking his own death—as well as one that’s more technical: How is it possible that a single person had sole access to the funds of one of Canada’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges?

Cotten was able to maintain this level of control over his customers’ assets in part because Quadriga had kept most of it in “cold wallets,” or hardware that allows exchanges to store cryptocurrency offline. Exchanges typically use cold wallets as bank vaults because they’re less vulnerable to hackers than hot wallets, which are connected to the internet.

“Best practices involve putting the bulk of the funds in cold storage and keeping on hand only a small amount of coins for the day-to-day operations [of an exchange],” says Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University who co-directs the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts.

In order to retrieve the funds in cold storage, you have to unlock the wallets with cryptographic keys, which are essentially strings of code. Cotten kept Quadriga’s keys only on his personal MacBook Pro. Vanity Fair reported that Cotten once caused a “momentary hysteria” by leaving his laptop on his yacht, which had already departed the dock. Cotten’s widow now says that no one can log in to the encrypted laptop, because he was the only one who knew the password. “It’s shocking, completely unbelievable that someone would have a multibillion-dollar operation run out of one laptop,” says Preston Byrne, a lawyer at the cryptocurrency-focused firm Byrne & Storm P.C. “They were really playing with fire there.”

Besides an untimely death, there are a number of scenarios in which using a personal laptop for key storage could be disastrous. Assuming that Cotten had connected his MacBook to the internet and used it for everyday tasks, a hacker may have been able to infiltrate or incapacitate the device. If he’d left it out in the open, someone could have stolen information manually. And based on prior reporting, it seems like he took laptop with him at least on occasion when he traveled, increasing the chance that it could’ve been lost or stolen.

According to Sirer, the most reliable way to secure an exchange’s cache of cryptocurrency is to split access between multiple individuals. Companies will oftentimes distribute what are known as key shares to three senior people. Any two of those key shares can be combined to unlock the funds. Sirer says, “It’s a good idea because the loss of any one share doesn’t affect the operation, and it takes two people to steal funds.” And rather than using a personal laptop, you’d typically want to store the cryptographic information on a hardware security module, which is a device specifically designed for managing digital keys, and lock it away in a vault.

The only apparent reasons why someone would keep all the key information on a single MacBook Pro would be either due to extreme sloppiness or to engineer an exit scam in which a CEO disappears with customers’ cryptocurrency. Most CEOs don’t have sole access to key information nowadays, though you would have been more likely to see this sort of risky key storage with small- or medium-sized exchanges in the early days of cryptocurrency at the beginning of the decade. “Back then, pretty much every exchange operation, with maybe the exception of Coinbase, was pretty amateurish,” says Byrne. “Now, the bigger exchanges tend to be better funded and more sophisticated, and I don’t think you really see a whole lot of them doing this. But who knows? We just don’t know.” When choosing a cryptocurrency exchange, it can be difficult to discern just how secure it is. However, you can check to see whether the company has been audited by an independent firm, which would likely involve reviewing how it stored its cryptographic keys—as well as any other, um, interesting risks.","This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Galen Moore is a senior research analyst at CoinDesk Research, focused on developing metrics and analysis for crypto asset investors. Christine Kim is a research analyst for CoinDesk. She focusses on producing data-driven insights about the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.

Things change fast in crypto. The only prediction that seems safe is that the narratives and metrics that seem important today will be eclipsed by new ideas, in a matter of months.

Nonetheless, on the cusp of a new year and a new decade, we will attempt a look ahead at the important events and issues to watch in 2020. We fully expect this research note to age poorly, but here at the end of 2019 is a list of what CoinDesk Research expects to be watching closely in the coming year.

Sometime in May, bitcoin will go through a programmed halving of the block reward allotted to the miners who maintain the network on which it runs. This means miners who contribute computing power to the security of the network will receive half the number of bitcoins for each block of data they successfully record to bitcoin’s blockchain. To what extent is bitcoin’s price driven by supply-side economics? Are there predictable patterns of investment (and disillusionment) around the event itself? We hope to find out.

Telegram, a messaging platform, became the second-largest initial coin offering (ICO) of 2018. Shares in the ICO were sold in the US under an SEC exemption, with shareholders expecting delivery of a crypto token, whenever Telegram’s blockchain-based network goes live. In 2019, the SEC sued to block that asset distribution and Telegram is fighting back. Don’t expect this one to end in 2020, but the twists and turns along the way will actively shape how developers and investors view their prospects for distribution and use of new coins and tokens.

Will Facebook’s Libra project stick to its plan to launch a wallet to store and transfer the proposed stablecoin by June 2020? If it does, we’ll be watching closely for indicators to tell us whether Libra is fulfilling or falling short of its promise to bank the unbanked. And, we’ll hope to learn whether governments’ noted concerns over private currency issuance have basis in reality.

Since its founding, bitcoin has been tied to the idea that economic stimulus through monetary policy is a bad idea. With interest rates going negative in economies around the world, many bitcoiners seem to be watching the signs of impending global recession with something approaching glee. Bitcoin’s narrative tells us it’s “digital gold.” Therefore, it should act as a haven in times of economic downturn. Will it prove that story, or disprove it, or is it too early to tell? Global macro events and bitcoin markets’ reaction may tell us the answer.

The year 2019 saw commentary on bitcoin from the White House and the US Federal Reserve. Facebook’s entry into crypto assets brought digital currencies before Congress. In the polarized US political landscape, it’s unlikely that a polarizing issue like crypto will be a bipartisan issue. Look out for pro- and no-coin election-year stances on party lines, as each side stakes out its ground.

In 2019, increasing use of the stablecoin Tether tilted transaction volume toward crypto assets backed by off-chain assets, such as dollars, rather than assets that derive their value from on-chain network effects or other as-yet undefined fundamentals. Was that a tipping point, or a blip? The question is crucial to the still-unanswered conundrum: what is all this magic internet money supposed to be good for, anyway?

“DeFi,” or “decentralized finance,” is the latest narrative to capture the imagination of the ethereum-following futurists who believe decentralized applications and smart contracts are an invention on par with the joint stock corporation. For now, DeFi is a way for people who are already long ether to earn a little interest. Will it attract new users to crypto assets? Will banks without bankers allow global finance to make inroads into new parts of the global economy?

In 2019, Beijing’s talk of a digital yuan made China the first major economy on a path to issuing its own digital currency, based to some extent on bitcoin’s model for validating transactions and ownership. How would a digital yuan change crypto? How might it change the balance of economic power and the dollar’s status as global reserve currency? Will other countries move first, or follow? We may see the beginnings of a new chapter for an asset category that first gained adoption among libertarians.

While we have yet to see the approval for a regulated bitcoin exchange traded fund in the U.S., other cryptocurrency derivatives such as bitcoin futures have passed the necessary checks and scrutiny of U.S. regulators. Chairman of the Commodity Futures and Trade Commission Heath Tarbert went so far as to suggest in a speech this year that a regulated ethereum futures market in the U.S. is also not far off from being approved. How great of an impact might these new financial tools have on the level of institutional participation in crypto come 2020? At least from the trading volume of Bakkt futures, the answer so far seems to be not a lot. This might change however in the new year and is well worth watching for signs of significant growth.","Fidelity Investments has said it will establish a cryptocurrency trading business in Europe, after first launching the business a year ago in the US to service institutional investors trading digital assets.

In a statement, Fidelity Investments said the European business will provide the ‘essential building blocks’ for digital asset investing including institutional-grade custody, and trade execution via a trading venue with multiple sources of liquidity, on a platform using the fund manager’s internal crossing engine and smart order router.

Chris Tyrer, a managing director at Barclays who led the bank’s digital assets project, will join Fidelity Investments as head of Fidelity Digital Assets in Europe to manage the new business and lead client service.

“Since launching Fidelity Digital Assets in the US over a year ago, we’ve seen significant interest and engagement by the institutional community, which show no signs of slowing,” said Tom Jessop, head of corporate business development for Fidelity Investments and president of Fidelity Digital Assets.

“We’re also encouraged by continued corporate and venture investment in market infrastructure companies as well as the entry of traditional exchanges into the digital assets ecosystem. These and other market indicators, alongside interest expressed from UK. and European client prospects, indicate a market with increasing potential which gives us the confidence to expand the digital assets business geographically.”

Fidelity Investments confirmed plans to launch a US-based cryptocurrency firm last year to support institutional investors engaging with digital assets, with custody and trade execution services. Fidelity has been exploring the use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies since 2014 via its Bitcoin Incubator.

“The demand we’ve seen for Fidelity’s digital asset custody and trade execution services has been borderless, and we’re scaling our business to operate in a variety of jurisdictions to support this industry for the long-term,” Tyrer, head of Fidelity Digital Assets in Europe, commented. “In doing so, we’re building on the commitment to make digitally-native assets, such as bitcoin, more accessible to institutional investors.”","Source: iStock/Muratani

We are just days away from one of the biggest holidays of the year in the Western World, known for the bright, colorful lights, colors red and green, the decorated trees, cookies, and gifts. It’s well-known that holidays are commercialized to the max. Gifts are a major part of almost any holiday, and Christmas sees trillions (yes, trillions) of dollars spent globally for those special things that’ll make loved ones happy.

Buying presents is tough enough. Add some crypto to the mix and you may have a veritable puzzle on your hands. Whether you’re good at purchasing gifts or not, and whether you know anything about crypto or not, we’ve come up with a list that might make that shopping choice a lot easier.

Traditional Crypto Gifts

There are some gifts which have quickly become traditional, and for a good reason – they are excellent and very useful gifts. For starters, the best course of action might be to buy somebody more crypto, or even their first one (a few). How about investing in stablecoin? Or you can do some research into altcoins and choose those you’d like to invest in, or simply get your family members and friends to stack sats by starting it for them. Purchase something nice on a crypto rewards site, and give both the purchased items and the gained sats to your friend/family member.

You can also give to a crypto-friendly charity in the name of a friend or a family member, and we’ve written about some great ones in our Black Friday article.

Another excellent choice is purchasing a good hardware wallet to keep those sweet digital coins safely. As we’ve discussed last year, Ledger, Trezor and KeepKey are among the most popular options, and we’ve also talked about certain alternative options as well. Hardware wallets are a pricier option, but one worth investing in. A couple more things we’ve also mentioned last year are blockchain phones, such as the Exodus and Finney smartphones, and crypto collectibles– all excellent gifts.

To help your gift receiver not forget their wallet password or seed phrases, thus loosing access to their coins, Safe Seed Mnemonic is something to consider. We’ve also reported on a long-term seed word and other valuable data storage option in the form of a solid metal capsule, called Cryptosteel Capsule, which can store information in up to 123 characters.

Also a traditional gift, Bitcoin mining equipment might help to those looking to obtain a greater share of the hashrate ahead of the Bitcoin halving.

Just days after cryptocurrency analysts suggested that a $2 billion Chinese Ponzi scheme was stifling Bitcoin‘s price, its enormous Ethereum stash is on the move.

The transfer was detected by Twitter-based transaction monitor @whale_alert earlier today. In total, PlusToken goons shifted 789,525 ETH, worth more than $105 million at the time.

🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 789,525 #ETH (105,099,509 USD) transferred from PlusToken to unknown wallet Tx: https://t.co/9kTSZy7Y1G — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 19, 2019

Many onlookers suggested that those in command of the funds were looking to dump the cryptocurrency on the market, but there’s been no reported transfers since.

This Ponzi scheme wants to cash out its Bitcoin and Ethereum, stat

Earlier this week, Hard Fork reported that the PlusToken Ponzi scheme had sought to liquidate $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency swindled from unsuspecting investors.

Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis claimed that someone in charge of PlusToken funds had been selling large amounts of Bitcoin to dodgy over-the-counter brokers, who then go on to sell it via cryptocurrency exchange Huobi.

So far, the firm says PlusToken has successfully laundered at least $185,000 worth of Bitcoin and using this method, as well as $1.3 million worth of Ether.

There’s also $134 million in Bitcoin controlled by PlusToken that’s reportedly ready to be dumped.

ETH has definitely been dumping lately, but so has Bitcoin

At the time, the firm noted it had detected 800,000 ETH ($102 million) sent from PlusToken’s wallets to individual addresses owned by the scammers themselves.

That’s pretty much exactly the amount of Ether sent earlier this morning.

It’s hard to say whether this has affected ETH’s price, at least so far. Yes, the entire cryptocurrency market has tanked lately, but trading sentiment generally follows Bitcoin.

Yesterday, on the two-year anniversary of its dizzying $20,000 highs, Bitcoin crashed to hit $6,500. Today, however, it’s rebounded by 10 percent to clear $7,100.

This is not investment advice. This is for educational purposes only. Do your own research, damnit. No, really, don’t buy Bitcoin or Ethereum because you read this article. Past performance is not indicative of future results. I’m not even qualified to tell you that. See what I mean? Do your own research. Please.","Nearly one year ago, I shared a handful of predictions about cryptocurrency’s prospects in 2019. At the time, I mostly focused on crypto-linked financial products, including the long-awaited bitcoin ETF. But while the majority of my predictions about the financialization of crypto came true, there’s one notable story my crystal ball didn’t reveal: the growing role of large social media players.

The story of 2019 has been Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra, announced in June, and its many missteps. I hardly could’ve predicted the ZuckBuck, let alone the PR saga that followed.

Libra’s wobbly beginnings took many by surprise—and quickly caused outrage. Policymakers accused Mark Zuckerberg of trying to create his own money, ostensibly to compete against the traditional financial system. And while Facebook has stood by a 2020 launch date for Libra, it seems the chances of the digital currency going live are dwindling. (Of course, even if Libra doesn’t launch, the company’s financial aspirations are clear: Facebook is already expanding its other payments services, such as WhatsApp Pay.)

Mirroring Libra, there hasn’t yet been a digital currency revolution on the global scale, either. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been a relative nonstarter. As world citizens, we must take seriously whispers about China’s digital yuan, but to date, the greatest evidence of CBDCs has arrived in the form of Venezuela’s petro crypto and the Marshall Islands’ very questionable national crypto. Realistically, broad-based crypto money—government-backed or otherwise—remains a pipe dream.

As we look ahead though, there are two major trends worth following: 1) the slow unraveling of ethereum, the second-largest crypto project, and 2) the seeds of decentralized social media, currently being explored by Twitter and others. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, has funded decentralization research and open-source development of bitcoin (via Square, his payments company), nodding to a vastly different future for the web.

Regardless of whether these visions—distributed online platforms and deflationary, non-government currency—take hold, it’s clear that Twitter and Square are anticipating and responding to social changes. Before any of you complain that Dorsey’s late to the game, I’ll remind you: It doesn’t matter who starts, it matters who finishes.

My 2019 predictions, revisited

The SEC won’t approve a bitcoin ETF



Right! As of writing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission still hasn’t approved a bitcoin ETF. As the stock market regulator worries about bitcoin market manipulation, it seems unlikely to sign off on any financial vehicles to enable further speculation. For what it’s worth, even without an ETF, bitcoin rebounded almost 80% this year—jumping from $3,850 on Jan. 1 to $6,870 at the time of writing.

Privacy coins will make a resurgence

Partially right. So, I can’t give myself full credit for this. But in the first quarter of 2019, privacy coins like Grin and Beam were all the rage. Since then, it seems interest has tailed off. And based on price alone, I don’t deserve more than half-credit. Zcash has dropped nearly 50%, from $57 on Jan. 1 to $29 at the time of writing. *Grimace.* But Monero has remained fairly stable—$48 on Jan. 1 to $46 today.

The CFTC will approve ether futures



Wrong, so far. Admittedly, this was my most bullish prediction and I whiffed. Although ether futures haven’t come to market in 2019, there’s a good chance it will happen soon. My assessment was simply a bit premature. Earlier this year, the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission even said ether futures in 2020 were “likely.” And if there’s one person to trust, it’d be him.

Ethereum’s Proof of Stake will continue to be a mess



Right again! I saved my favorite prediction for last because, well, it’s a doozy. In addition to the Ethereum Foundation’s Virgil Griffith being arrested for allegedly helping North Korea evade sanctions, the project has endured yet another tough year. What matters is that ethereum’s claims of a new, decentralized internet are, well, essentially nonsense.

I’ve been reserved in my criticism, but ethereum’s most recent debacle is laughable—developers built in an “Ice Age” mechanism to slow the network and incentivize themselves to upgrade it (to Proof of Stake, an alternative issuance model). But in the latest network update, they forgot to push back the “Ice Age,” so now they have to update again. This could’ve killed ethereum, but all’s well that ends well, right? Right?!

The companies announced on Friday that a new set of derivatives contracts, including swaps, would help miners manage their risks when running operations in 2020, including the upcoming bitcoin halving (when the amount of bitcoin produced per block mined is cut in half).

The new products are expected to launch next month, though a specific date was not provided.

According to a press release, some $3 billion in bitcoin is expected to be mined next year at current price levels.

Rich Rosenblum, GSR co-founder, told CoinDesk that the companies were specifically offering two products: “a tailored risk management solution for miners,” which provides an average-priced option or swap contract, and a new type of futures contract that trades based on hashrate.

“In a general sense if it’s hashrate-related it can either have physical delivery, delivering your spot hashrate via a proxy, or if it’s a forward market,” he said. “You can deliver bitcoin or you can deliver hashrate.”

Hash rate can be delivered physically by using mining equipment as collateral for the contract, he said as one example. In a follow-up email, a spokesperson added that hashes which correspond to bitcoin-producing blocks could also be delivered, allowing the recipient to claim the mining reward.

GSR would look to third-party data providers to detail what the actual hash rate on the bitcoin network or a difficulty derivative would be.

However, this second type of derivative is not yet ready to be rolled out, he said.

“We already have some of these new products ready but … the second is in a test phase and a work in progress,” he said.

In a statement, GSR co-founder Cristian Gil said the factors miners must consider include price, mining equipment costs, electricity costs and mining difficulty, but at present companies do not hedge “against adverse price action.”","Halving prompts a drop in the number of new Bitcoins generated by the network, translating to a fall in the growth rate of the Bitcoin supply - Shutterstock/PowerUp

LONDON - 19 December 2019: If you're not a bitcoin enthusiast, you probably haven't heard what's happening next year: It's called the ""halving"", and it will cut production of the cryptocurrency by 50%.



No one's in control of this process. It's a rule written into bitcoin's underlying code by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto more than a decade ago.



The event, expected in May 2020, slashes by half the number of new coins awarded to bitcoin miners who provide global supply of the cryptocurrency by solving complex maths puzzles.



That's a big change in a market worth about $120 billion where bitcoin worth several billions dollars are created every year.



Players in the know are preparing for the sharp price gains and volatility that have accompanied previous halvings, which happen roughly every four years and act to both ensure the scarcity of bitcoin and keep a cap on price inflation.



There are likely to be winners and losers. So market participants, from bitcoin miners and traders, are trying to fathom how the next halving might play out to gain an edge.



""This is the biggest question right now for most of the industry,"" said Eyal Avramovich, chief executive of MineBest, a Warsaw-based company that mines bitcoin.



The fracture to the production of bitcoin provides a reminder of one reason why the decentralised digital currency has confounded regulation and acceptance by mainstream finance: Its fate remains tied to arcane technological factors.



In theory, if supply is cut and demand stays constant, prices rise. This time around, seven crypto traders and miners interviewed by Reuters said the May halving would probably lead to greater volatility and trading volumes. However the cut to supply is liked to be more priced in than previously, they said, with many traders already geared up for the upcoming event.



MAKING MONEY FROM SWINGS



Bitcoin miners use high-spec computers to compete against other machines in the crypto network, racing to add new ""blocks"" to the blockchain ledger that underpins the cryptocurrency.



They are rewarded with a set number of bitcoin, currently 12.5. At current rates of block creation, the next halving will take place in May, when the number will drop to 6.25.



In the one-year periods after the two previous halvings, in November 2012 and July 2016, bitcoin rose around by 80 times and four times respectively. It is not clear how much of these price gains was down to the halving, versus with other factors.



This time around, bitcoin derivatives markets - still nascent - point to higher volatility around the time of the halving, said Jeff Dorman of Arca, a U.S. crypto investment firm.



Such volatility in bitcoin markets tends to benefit quantitative hedge funds and high-frequency traders that seek to make money from swinging crypto prices.



""For us, the event will be positive because it cause activity in the market,"" said Ha Duong of Cambrial, an cryptocurrency investor in Berlin.



But for miners that hold large inventories of bitcoin, volatility can also be a hindrance. For them, stability of price gives greater predictability for investment in new gear.



While bitcoin futures contracts allow miners to hedge the risk of their inventories, there are currently few tools for them to properly hedge against volatility, said Ricky Li, co-founder of crypto trader Altonomy.



""If you want to long volatility, the options contracts available for the market right now really do not have the tenor (length),"" he said.



""Right now all you can do is to just make sure your holdings risk, your inventory risk, is hedged.""","December 19, 2019 6 min read

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Cryptocurrencies have kept a relatively low profile in 2019 following a record-breaking rise in 2017 and then a spectacular crash in 2018. Are they worth revisiting in 2020? We asked these experts and Advisors in The Oracles to share where they think crypto is headed next.

EDITOR’S NOTE: This article expresses the views and opinions of individuals and is not a substitute for professional financial advice. Do your own research and consult your own financial adviser. Any claims in this article have not been independently verified.

1. Cryptocurrency will transform banking.

The world is getting ready for a financial and banking transformation. Engineers and product developers have been hard at work getting products together to bring Bitcoin to general use and distribution. In a year, there will be no reason to pay banks 2.5 percent to 4 percent every time you swipe your credit card. Bitcoin is a frictionless transaction. As it and other tokens like Tezos, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash become more prevalent, their value will increase. I predict a $250,000 Bitcoin price by 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. —Tim Draper, legendary VC, founder of Draper Associates and DFJ, and author of “How to Be the Startup Hero”

2. It’s excellent, long term.

Image credit: The Oracles

Whether you invest in crypto now should depend on whether you believe in the potential of blockchain technology. Yes, it didn’t live up to everyone’s expectations right away, but that’s also happened with basically every other disruptive technology. Investing in crypto now could be like picking up Amazon stock for less than IPO price, or it could be like stocking up on Betamaxes on clearance. Only time will tell.

Our developers at AE Studio work with blockchain companies like Protocol Labs, and we’re constantly impressed with the progress and innovation that’s happening in the space. Blockchain technology is evolving fast and becoming increasingly important; so I think of crypto as an excellent long-term, albeit high-risk, investment. If you think so too, my No. 1 piece of advice is to invest no more than you can afford to lose in things like BTC and ETH, which will likely positively correlate with blockchain adoption. And hodl long term! —Judd Rosenblatt, founder and CEO of AE Studio, an Agile web development and data science consulting firm with a mission to increase human agency with technology; vote for the charity they donate to next month

3. It’s the future.

Image credit: The Oracles

While the markets may have crashed, the growth of the infrastructure enabling cryptocurrency has never really slowed down, especially at Skrill. According to many industry experts, the space is now stable, more mature, and ready to move into its next phase. To see something that started as no more than an idea in the depths of the internet spawn a new ecosystem and grow into a multibillion-dollar asset class is nothing short of remarkable to me. The largest companies and countries in the world now discuss cryptocurrency as a viable currency of the future. I would just remind budding investors that trading in such a dynamic space means the stakes are higher. Proper research and risk management are essential. —Lorenzo Pellegrino, CEO of Skrill, NETELLER, and Income Access at Paysafe; connect with Lorenzo on LinkedIn

4. Bitcoin will beat the critics — and here’s why.

Image credit: The Oracles

Remember the historic economic crash 10 years ago, when many people’s life savings were wiped out? That’s when Bitcoin was born; a cryptocurrency created partly in response to the leading financial intermediaries that helped bring down the economy.

Bitcoin has become more widely adopted for several reasons. It has a predictable inflation rate because only 21 million will ever be produced. It is borderless, with transparency that no bank can match. And it is trustless because the system was designed so you don’t have to trust anyone else for it to function. It has been declared dead by journalists 378 times, including 40 times this year. But Bitcoin won’t die because it can be trusted more than most government currencies. There is no intermediary. And in a world full of failed financial intermediaries, that is a big deal. —Dan Schatt, co-founder and CEO of Cred; connect with Dan on LinkedIn

5. Cryptocurrency adoption today is where the internet used to be.

Image credit: The Oracles

The cryptocurrency decline was good for the market because it taught investors that not all coins are as shiny as they might seem. We always encourage making decisions based on real market value instead of speculation. How do you measure the value of a token without deep knowledge? Look for platforms that can be integrated into enterprise processes to enhance their workflows. That’s how mass adoption happens.

When the internet started, companies had to integrate the technology to deliver content for users to consume. That’s where we are now with cryptocurrency, but we’re missing platforms that companies can leverage and are capable of operating on a global scale. That’s likely why the ROI of tokens from the top 11 blockchain platforms (WAVES, EOS, NEO, ETH, LSK, ADA, MATIC, FTM, ZIL, TRX, and ALGO) averages more than 1,000 percent. —Johann Polecsak, co-founder and CTO of QAN blockchain platform; connect with Johann on LinkedIn

6. 2020 will bring a historical milestone.

Image credit: The Oracles

In 1997, Amazon went public at $18 per share. The stock grew to over $300 per share before plummeting to under $6 when the dot-com bubble burst in 2001. Fast forward to 2018: Amazon reached $2,050 per share and became the second U.S. company to eclipse $1 trillion in stock market value. Many investors see this pattern happening with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin skyrocketed from about $3,600 per coin to over $19,000 in 2017. Then it fell below $3,500 before climbing to $12,000 in 2019.

My advice is to keep an eye on the Bitcoin halving in 2020, which can dramatically change the cryptocurrency supply and demand equation. I believe it will be remembered as a historical milestone for Bitcoin and the entire industry. It could be the turning point that takes Bitcoin from a niche, unstable asset to a mainstream form of payment. —Alex Althausen, CEO of StormGain, a cryptocurrency trading platform; connect with Alex on LinkedIn

As part of the deal announced Thursday, Binance has purchased equity in the derivatives firm and purchased long positions in the FTX Token, FTT, the platform’s native coin.

“The investment will help accelerate the growth of FTX with support and strategic advisory from Binance while FTX maintains its independent operations,” FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said.

In return, FTX will help develop Binance’s products, particularly its flagship exchange, Binance.com, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk. FTX also announced its intention to build out a suite of products complementary to tokenized ecosystems, a project Malta-based Binance will assist.

Founded in the spring of 2019, FTX was an incubation project for Alameda Research, a digital asset research firm. FTX offers OTC, futures, indexes and spot trading and operates out of the Caribbean islands of Antigua and Barbuda. The exchange processes nearly a half-billion dollars of trade volume per day, according to a release from Binance.

“The FTX team has built an innovative crypto trading platform with stunning growth,” Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said in a statement. “We see quite a bit of ourselves in the FTX team and believe in their potential in becoming a major player in the crypto derivatives markets.”","There’s obviously a big problem with this. Many people don’t trust Facebook with their private data, see it as a threat to democracy, or both. Now the company wants to launch its own currency? Is it just trolling us?

At this point the company might emphasize that it won’t be in charge of the Libra Association, the nonprofit it created to manage the currency. The group, made up of 20 other firms in addition to Facebook, will manage a “reserve” of government-issued money that is supposed to back each digital unit and keep the currency stable. Half of that reserve will be US dollars, and the other half will be made up of British pounds, Japanese yen, euros, and Singapore dollars.

Fine, but the design itself has worried US policymakers, who say they can’t even tell what Libra is, much less how to deal with it. Whatever it is, it will probably be hard to ignore in 2020.

A trigger warning for the purists

If you are insulted that I even called Libra a “cryptocurrency,” and find yourself triggered by what you view as the misuse of this word, I’ve got some bad news: it’s going to get worse. You can thank Libra for that. Also, the People’s Bank of China.

Recall Zuckerberg’s warning to Congress about how China had “similar ideas” to Libra. Indeed, China appears poised to launch a digital version of its sovereign currency in 2020, and officials from the People’s Bank of China have said the digital renminbi will bear similarities to Facebook’s plan.

Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts argue that true cryptocurrency is the product of a decentralized, “permissionless” network like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is designed to provide freedom from corporate and government censorship, and its network is controlled by a global public network made up of thousands of computers.

Libra, meanwhile, was dreamed up by a huge corporation, and its network will be controlled by a small number of vetted private entities. China’s digital renminbi will apparently be similar, but controlled by a central bank. Nonetheless, expect headlines and news reports in 2020 to keep calling them cryptocurrencies, with no regard for your feelings on the matter. Introducing new terms would be likely to make the situation more disorienting than it already is for non-enthusiasts, most of whom probably won’t even grasp the distinction between “digital currency” and “cryptocurrency.” Sorry.

Traditional financial gatekeepers will lose more of their mojo

If you are the US government, in the coming year crypto will probably trigger you too.

In 2019, we saw small-time illustrations of how digital currency could be used to chip away at America’s influence over the global financial system. That phenomenon is likely to continue–and even expand—in 2020.

Since the dollar is by far the world’s most popular reserve currency, the US has disproportionate control over how money flows around the world. But China aims to promote its own currency, the renminbi, as an alternative, and some foreign-policy analysts think it might do so by encouraging international adoption of the digital version. That may be part of why its central bank seemed to spring into action after the Libra announcement.

In addition to China, Iran and Russia also appear interested in using digital currency as the basis for a parallel financial system that the US can’t control. The governments of Venezuela and North Korea have apparently already turned to cryptocurrency to evade sanctions.

We got a hint of how the US might react to this kind of thing in November, when the Department of Justice announced charges against Virgil Griffith, an employee for the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit that supports the development of the world’s second-most-valuable cryptocurrency network, for allegedly providing “services” to North Koreans in a way that violated US sanctions. Now he faces 20 years in prison.

Is that excessive? Should the US have so much power to block other nations from the financial system? How important is that power to its national security? Could China use its digital currency to expand its global influence? And what might be the geopolitical impact of hundreds of millions of people using something like Libra?

Have a headache yet? You were warned.","Bitcoin pulled back from some of the losses seen on recently and picked up on Wednesday.

A new study of 140,000 crypto addresses finds that few accounts are needed to form majority ownership of many coins. More than half of all LTC is held in just 189 non-exchange addresses, and on average, the top 100 ERC20 tokens are majority-owned by just 34 addresses. Almost 1 in 4 tokens had a majority owned by the project founder. In contrast, you need over 1,100 of the top addresses to control the majority of bitcoin cash.

Whales Still Dominate Much of Crypto

Clovr, a research-focused cryptocurrency company, has analyzed the wealth distribution among 140,000 non-exchange addresses from four major cryptocurrencies and the 100 most valuable Ethereum tokens. The researchers found that surprisingly few accounts are needed to form majority ownership of many coins and that some currencies have more unequal distribution of wealth now than they did in 2018.

Some of the richest addresses are owned by exchanges, which hold the wealth of many people. To find a close approximation of individual whales, the study removed all addresses known or predicted to be owned by an exchange. The researchers identified addresses that belonged to 41 exchanges using wallet nicknames associated with each address and predicted which anonymous addresses were owned by exchanges by cross-referencing address names across currencies.

The study investigated the wealth distribution of four major cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, and litecoin – and found that last had the most centralized wealth. Just 189 addresses are needed to own a majority of all LTC. The 10 richest litecoin accounts owned a tenth of all LTC wealth.

Litecoin may have the most unequal distribution of wealth out of the four major currencies analyzed, but ether has seen its wealth inequality rise significantly since 2018. This is based on the Gini index, a classic measure of wealth distribution in economics, which was used to measure the spread of wealth across each currency’s 10,000 richest addresses. The data shows that ether’s wealth inequality rose by 13% from 2018 to 2019. BTC had the lowest wealth inequality of the four major cryptocurrencies, with BCH the next after it.

“The fact that a few whales hold as much wealth as many small fry is true of all financial realms. It’s a hot topic among cryptocurrency enthusiasts because the lower liquidity and higher volatility in cryptomarkets mean whales can make bigger waves,” the researchers explained. “Concentrated ownership of wealth creates serious points of failure in a system designed to be robust through decentralization. This is perhaps most true for centralized exchanges, the singular custodians of many people’s wealth. Such failure can and does happen. The bigger the whale, the bigger the target – hackers and scammers hunt with big harpoons.”

Big Fish in Small Ponds

ERC20 tokens, those using the Ethereum platform, generally exhibit a lot of inequality. The researchers found that among the 100 Ethereum tokens with the highest market caps, the average number of addresses holding a majority was just 34. But the size of the majority group varied widely from token to token. Twenty-four of the 100 largest tokens were majority-owned by one address, almost always the token founder’s.

This inequality is often due to the way the availability of tokens is controlled by the founder, but having such centralized wealth brings its own risks. The initial coin offerings (ICOs) used to fund some tokens were identified as pump and dump scams, enticing investments that boosted the token’s value, only for the founder to cash out on the large number of tokens they withheld.

However, according to the study, the distribution of wealth in a token or coin may mean different things depending on how the currency originated. Huobi’s tokens had the highest wealth inequality of all ERC20 tokens, according to the analysis, but Huobi token was not funded via an initial coin offering and, therefore, possibly didn’t expose investors to the same level of risk.

To help understand which tokens are most likely to have very unequal distributions of wealth — a sign that a market could potentially be easily dominated by few individuals or manipulated by its founder — the researchers related the “top-heaviness” of tokens’ wealth distribution to the tokens’ market capitalization. A top-heavy wealth distribution would be one where large amounts of wealth were held by a small number of addresses – defined here by the log ratio of the mean address wealth to the median address wealth.

The higher a token’s market cap was the more likely the distribution of wealth was evenly spread compared to other tokens. In other words, the tokens that showed the greatest concentration of wealth in the fewest addresses were all tokens that have relatively small market capitalization – $100 million or less, in fact.

“These smaller token projects are lucrative investments for some because the returns can be monumental, but potential rewards reflect the risk,” the researchers warned. “Investors should do their research and consider many factors before buying any cryptocurrency. Just make sure one of the things you consider is how big the whales are in your sea – either you can swim in the current, or you’ll be swept along in their wake.”

The mysterious nature of bitcoin has led to common misperceptions about its use, with many in the mainstream relegating it to the realm of hackers and gamers.

The history of cryptocurrency shows quite a different purpose: Bitcoin was actually created with the intention of bridging the global wealth gap. The domain name ""bitcoin.org"" was registered online in the midst of the Great Recession of 2008. Soon after, the mysterious and purported creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, released statements explaining the electronic cash-to-cash system was developed as a means to fight centralized currency manipulation.

Nevertheless, wealth inequality has become so drastic that many in the lower and middle classes can't afford to own bitcoin dollars. Inequality in the US has reached a record high since the US Census started tracking it five decades ago, with the federal data showing evidence of a shrinking middle class.

Though the global economy continues to face substantial pressures, experts say the growing popularity of bitcoin might help return it to its intended use: fighting income inequality.

How bitcoin is helping to strengthen the middle class

What's unique about bitcoin is that it functions on another network, one that's a lot more transparent than a corporate bank. Every bitcoin transaction is always recorded in its public archive — the blockchain.

Blockchain is the record of all exchanging cryptocurrencies, essentially digital money, between two parties. It is an independent, shared encrypted database of money entries — think of it as a shared Google Doc. Bitcoin is one type of cryptocurrency among others like litecoin, ethereum, and ripple.

Mark Yusko, the CEO and CIO of investment advisory company Morgan Creek Capital Management, told Business Insider that he believes the blockchain network and its fundamental growth can be leveraged to alleviate income inequality. Yusko is known to be a longtime cryptocurrency bull, drawing investors toward more exposure with bitcoin.

""The government and the elites want to have all the wealth, so they manufacture inflation and the wealth flows to the top,"" he said. ""And that's why we have the greatest wealth inequality in the history of mankind. Bitcoin helps solve that because now we can opt out as an owner of assets from that fiat system.""

The hedge-fund chief explained one of the main economic problems Americans face today is not owning any or enough assets like real estate property and stocks. Not having money to invest in markets and living from paycheck to paycheck is a major setback for the poor and middle class.

There are more opportunities to acquire assets through blockchain technology. For instance, bitcoin is now accepted in some real estate markets, where investors can own parts of a building if they can't afford the whole unit, reports CNBC. This new business model can help distribute wealth and widen the investor demographic. It can also open possibilities of owning property across international borders.

Introducing financial literacy in developing countries

While encouraging people to own assets is a way to fight income inequality in the US, developing countries need a different game plan.

As more people around the world own smartphones, bitcoin has the potential to reach even more users in the 2020s. Because cryptocurrency is only transferred electronically, having the most basic internet connection immediately helps anyone access and trade the currency.

Attention toward expanding the crypto space in developing countries first emerged in 2017, when fintech expert Anton Dzyatkovsky cofounded MicroMoney, a money-lending app targeting Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines that provides services to help people build a credit history on the blockchain. There are 1.7 billion people around the world who don't have bank accounts and can't access loads, according to The World Bank. Bitcoin has the potential to reach this demographic and provide those financial services.

""We are proud of the fact that we can help people who have no access to the classical, but outdated centralized economy of the bank,"" Dzyatkovsky told Business Insider.

Cryptocurrency is also making a breakthrough in Latin America, Business Insider reports. In 2018, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency by 95% due to hyperinflation, prompting more than 400,000 Venezuelans to flee from the economic collapse. After the government issued a new cryptocurrency called petro, the fleeing citizens were able to make cross-border transactions without relying on paper money. The petro is still used in 2019.

In another case in 2017, an anonymous bitcoin millionaire going by the alias ""Pine"" committed $5 million worth of bitcoin donations to GiveDirectly, an organization that's running the world's largest basic income experiment in Kenyan villages. The bitcoin dollars went toward giving people access to clean water and sending money directly to people living in poverty who are facing food shortage, school fees, and home repairs.

""If this money were to be given to everybody, this would be a very good thing,"" Edwin Odongo Anyango, a 30-year-old day laborer at one of the Kenyan villages, told Business Insider. ""What this money does is it creates hope. And when people have hope, they are happy.""","You Can Earn Lead Tokens by Becoming a Crypto Community Champion

Announced Friday, CipherTrace has provided ATII with access to its user interface, a tool that will allow the organization to track criminal cryptocurrency transactions and help prevent them from accessing financial services.

“CipherTrace will be an instrumental partner in helping us promote corporate responsibility within financial institutions such as cryptocurrency exchanges,” said Aaron Kahler, ATII founder and president. “As public and private organizations continue to collaborate in the creation of a uniform front within the financial sector to fight human trafficking, we will see a true impact in the recovery of victims and prosecution of traffickers.”

An October update significantly increased the number of cryptocurrencies that CipherTrace’s tool was able to track. It can currently cover more than 700 different cryptos, including 87 percent of the top-100 by market cap. It has also made the complete financial transaction histories for top coins like bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin available to its client base, which include several law enforcement agencies.

ATII is a non-profit founded earlier this year to combat the modern-day slave trade through sharing intelligence as well as disrupting operations wherever possible. Pamela Clegg, CipherTrace’s director of financial investigations and education, has joined ATII’s advisory board to provide guidance and expertise on how the organization can most effectively track cryptocurrency transactions.

“Human trafficking is modern-day slavery and involves the use of force, fraud or coercion to obtain some type of labor of commercial sex act,” Clegg said in a statement. “As with most criminal organizations and activities, following the money is the most effective way to combat this global crime.”

Modern human trafficking, which has claimed more than 40 million victims globally, is an industry worth approximately $150 billion, according to statistics from the International Labour Organization. CipherTrace has already partnered with agencies, including INTERPOL and Lawyers Without Borders, to prevent human traffickers from using cryptocurrencies to sidestep conventional financial controls.

In the past, CipherTrace has been quick to point out instances where cryptocurrency businesses have not complied with financial regulation. The firm’s Q3 Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Report found that a third of all exchanges had little or no know-your-customer (KYC) verification checks.","Crypto crow, the cryptocurrency investing giant, and I mean physically, giant, who’s real name is Jason Appleton is my guest on Diva on The Block today. In this episode we discuss:

– Why he’s into cryptocurrency

– Charles Hoskinson MMA Fight

– Chainwise event in Ohio

– Cardano’s future

– Bitcoin price

– Future of cryptocurrency

If you are at all active in the cryptocurrency community, you probably already know him and if you don’t know him, well, you should.

After you watch the video, go to the comment section and let me know what you think of my discussion with Catherine Coley and your thoughts on Binance US.

About Crypto Crow, Jason Appleton

Jason Appleton, affectionately known as the Crypto Crow, is a cryptocurrency investor, trader, and entrepreneur. His mission is to educate people about the cryptocurrency space. He delivers his education in a blunt, upfront and honest way. His biggest followers gather around on his YouTube channel.

Crypto Crow and his family live in Cincinnati Ohio, where I actually flew to last month to attend his Chainwise event.

Jason grew up with very little, raised by a single mother. He saw struggle every day of his life.

According to his website, he spent 40 years learning new industries. He was able to establish a name in those industries for integrity, hard work, and accomplishment. Now, in the Cryptocurrency space, Jason’s mission is to rise into the ranks of the wealthy while bringing others along for the ride.

The Real Person Behind Crypto Crow Exposed!

Jason is a 7-foot tall giant. He makes fun of his size constantly and even goes on to call himself an ogre.

But his followers know about his soft side. He’s not afraid to shed a tear when he’s emotional.

He attributes this quality to his mother who taught him it’s ok for men to cry.

But his physique got him into MMA fights.

Beside’s Crypto Crow’s MMA experience in the past, he doesn’t appear to want to be back in the game himself anymore. In fact, he can get super emotional and maybe even start crying during the match. However, he is interested in getting Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson on the ring, even though his most recent attempt fell apart.

In this interview, we also find out what’s the favorite cryptocurrency for Crypto Crow: Cardano.

Crypto Crow’s Cardano Forecast

In this interview, Crypto Crow announced his favorite cryptocurrency project to be Cardano.

When asked about its current low prices, he said he’s not worried about them at all.

Price is not the biggest priority of the Cardano project at the moment. Cardano (ADA) could continue its downward momentum towards 0.026 or maybe even lower.

To Crypto Crow, this is the accumulation phase. Once the markets are back on its feet, investors are gonna rush back from their “crypto vacation” and start asking what’s good to invest in. And it may just be too late.

Bitcoin Price Forecast

The BTC/USD pas remained below the daily Ichimoku cloud. It now appears to have bottomed out just above the key support level of $6,406.

The pair may even be in the process of forming a Double Bottom bullish reversal chart pattern.

However, the bearish momentum still appears to be strong. A break below this key support level could open doors to further declines. Could Bitcoin reach the $4,000 again?

What do you think about Crypto Crow’s forecast on Cardano? What’s your favorite cryptocurrency?

Greece’s justice minister has signed an order for bitcoin fraud suspect Alexander Vinnik to be extradited to France — concluding an international legal battle surrounding the Russian cryptocurrency trading platform operator.

Government officials said Friday that Justice Minister Konstantinos Tsiaras has signed the order, but no extradition date has been set.

Vinnik, 39, was arrested in northern Greece while on vacation in 2017 at the request of U.S. authorities, where he is accused of laundering billions of dollars using the virtual currency.

Both the United States and Russia have also made extradition requests. U.S. authorities accuse Vinnik of laundering $4 billion worth of bitcoins through BTC-e, one of the world’s largest digital currency exchanges, which he allegedly operated.

A Greek official told the AP that the extradition order was signed Thursday and listed France as the top priority for extradition, followed by the United States and then Russia. The official asked not to be named pending official announcements.

Vinnik has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer said he planned to try and appeal the decision at a Greek high court.

Following his arrest and detention in Greece, Vinnik staged a hunger strike for several weeks to demand his release from prison. He is currently in custody at a state hospital in Athens.

The Russian Embassy in Athens criticized the decision to send Vinnik to France.

“We regret that the fully-substantiated request made by the Russian General Prosecutor’s office for the extradition of Alexander Vinnik to the country of his nationality was ignored,” the embassy said in a statement.

According to the 2017 U.S. indictment, BTC-e facilitated transactions for cybercriminals, receiving money hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, and narcotics distribution rings. The platform was founded in 2011 and shut down in 2017. Vinnik denies the allegations made in the U.S. indictment and says he acted as a technical consultant to the platform and had no knowledge of any illegal activity.

In the lead-up to New Year's Day 2020, CNBC's online journalists will be exploring the moments that defined the past 10 years for your money and set the table for the next decade and beyond. This decade marked the mainstream emergence of bitcoin. Proponents bid up the world's biggest cryptocurrency to dizzying heights and endured periodic crashes on the belief that it will one day replace gold as a store of value and actual money for purchases. Critics believe that bitcoin will do neither and call it a dangerous, modern day bubble like Holland's tulip bulb mania in the 1630s. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of Wall Street banking powerhouse J.P. Morgan Chase, can be counted in the latter camp. In September 2017, about three months before bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $20,000 per unit and crashed shortly thereafter, Dimon dropped a bomb on the crypto world. He called bitcoin a ""fraud."" Appearing at the CNBC-Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference, Dimon said at the time: ""It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed."" He also contended, ""It's just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed.""

It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed. Jamie Dimon J.P. Morgan Chairman & CEO

Centuries ago, tulips had became such a prized commodity that in 1636 they were being traded on many Dutch stock exchanges and many people traded or sold possessions to get in on the action, according to Investopedia. The bubble came to an end in 1637, which resulted in the bulbs trading at a fraction of their previous price, leaving many people in financial ruin. Dimon's comments about bitcoin touched off an explosive global debate among backers and haters. The J.P. Morgan CEO found himself being asked about bitcoin everywhere he went. Less than five months later, he threw in the towel, saying, ""I regret making"" those bitcoin remarks. ""I'm not interested that much in the subject at all,"" Dimon added, though he did acknowledge that ""blockchain is real."" Blockchain is the secure online ledger technology underlying bitcoin. J.P. Morgan and other major financial institutions are pursuing blockchain-related projects.

Rise and fall of bitcoin

The first bitcoins were mined in a block of 50 coins called the ""genesis block"" in January 2009. However, it wasn't until 2010 that bitcoin gained public attention with the launch of the first exchange that allowed investors to trade it. Back then, it was priced at pennies per unit. Bitcoin momentum really started to build in early 2017, when the price crossed $1,000. More investors, seeking a safe haven investment similar to gold, bought into the idea of a decentralized currency. To meet growing demand, two U.S. exchanges, the CME and Cboe, created platforms for customers to trade bitcoin futures. As the cryptocurrency went mainstream, the price of a bitcoin surged from around $2,000 in July 2017 to nearly $20,000 five months later near the end of that year. But that euphoria did not last.

2019-12-21,"Outlier Ventures, a venture capital firm, said that 2020 will be the start to a new phase in crypto, bitcoin, Ethereum, and blockchain following ten years of development and speculation.

The firm’s head of research Lawrence Lundy—which has invested in major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos, Brave, and Chainlink—said that the next ten years will be about deployment, if the last decade was primarily about installment.

In an end-of-the-year report entitled “18 Predictions for 2020,” Lundy identified key trends in bitcoin, Ethereum, and blockchain that would set the tone for the start of the deployment phase.

Trends of bitcoin

For major cryptocurrencies, scalability has always been the biggest issue as the demand for digital assets and blockchain usage increased.

Most blockchain developers generally agree that over the long-term, a second-layer settlement network on top of existing blockchains is crucial for growth.

Beginning 2020, the report suggested that the second-layer usage of bitcoin will see more light. Since its inception in 2009, bitcoin has been recognized as a store-of-value more than a payment settlement network.

With Lightning and other potential layer two solutions, Lundy said that bitcoin will increasingly be seen as an open financial platform.

“But the growth of LApps (Lightning Apps) and more broadly data anchoring will be a stronger fundamental signal of the development of a fee market and the long-term viability of Bitcoin,” read the report.

Trends of Ethereum

It is hardly any surprise but Outlier Ventures expect decentralized finance (DeFi) to continue to be the main narrative around Ethereum in the coming years.

In 2019, DeFi on Ethereum has seen explosive growth. Based on the data from DeFiPulse, the total value locked in DeFi platforms reached $661 million, the overwhelming majority coming from Ethereum.

Specifically, Ethereum’s largest DeFi platform Maker accounts for $329 million of the $661 million, and Ethereum is used as the main collateral for most DeFi applications.

Lundy noted:

“With Istanbul now live, we expect EIP-2028 to have a major impact on layer 2 adoption opening up use cases beyond crowdfunding and DeFi. Expect to see games currently using EOS and Tron to migrate over to Ethereum to take advantage of the DeFi lego available.”

Trends of Blockchain

In the area of blockchain, the report says that central bank-backed digital currencies will see significant progress with the lead of China.

On October 25, Chinese President Xi Jinping formally encouraged the development of blockchain and blockchain-related platforms while distancing from crypto.

Since then, as reported by NewsBTC, major industry executives have said that the reputation of the blockchain industry noticeably improved.

“In 2020, we expect this to be how the Chinese Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) launches with licenses given to select exchanges and dominant platforms as distribution platforms to hundreds of millions of users like Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent,” suggested the report.

Following China, France and other nations have signaled interest in developing government-owned digital currencies. There are expectations that South Korea is likely to be next with the hiring of a cryptocurrency specialist by the Bank of Korea.

At a summit attended by leaders of Muslim countries, including Malaysia, Turkey, Iran, Qatar, and Indonesia, the Iranian president proposed creating a Muslim cryptocurrency to cut reliance on the U.S. dollar. The Malaysian prime minister supports the idea of a unified cryptocurrency for Muslim countries.

Unified Muslim Cryptocurrency

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the prospect of creating a unified cryptocurrency for Muslim countries on Thursday. The discussion took place at the “Kuala Lumpur Summit 2019,” a four-day event which started on Wednesday.

Leaders from countries such as Malaysia, Turkey, Iran, Qatar, and Indonesia attended the summit. They aim to “discuss and find new solutions to problems facing the Muslim world as well as to improve the wellbeing of Muslims and Muslim countries in general,” the official website of the Prime Minister’s Office of Malaysia describes.

The leaders of Malaysia, Turkey, and Iran spoke at a roundtable session on Thursday where the subject of cryptocurrency was discussed, the Associated Press reported, adding:

Rouhani proposed an Islamic financial payment with Muslim countries trading in local currencies and the creation of a Muslim cryptocurrency to cut reliance on the U.S. dollar and weather the effects of market fluctuation.

He also urged Muslim nations “to deepen financial and trade cooperation to fight what he described as U.S. economic hegemony,” the news outlet conveyed. “The Muslim world should be designing measures to save themselves from the domination of the United States dollar and the American financial regime,” he was quoted as saying. The U.S. currently has sanctions against Iran. In addition, a Senate committee approved a bill last week to impose sanctions on Turkey.

Rouhani also talked about how rising extremism, coupled with other challenges such as weak governance, poverty, and corruption, are endangering sovereignty and paving the way for Western interference in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and other Muslim nations.

Malaysian Prime Minister’s Response to Muslim Crypto Proposal

After the roundtable session, the Malaysian prime minister was asked by the media about his response to Rouhani’s suggestion of a unified Muslim cryptocurrency. According to Bernama, the Malaysian government’s news agency:

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir said he is open to the idea of a unified cryptocurrency for Muslim countries.

“It is the first time we hear Iran and also Turkey are of the opinion that if we do not have American dollars, we can use our own currency or one common currency that we (Muslim nations) can create if we agree,” the prime minister was quoted as saying. “Malaysia had mooted the idea of a common currency for Islamic nations a long time ago, but the big powers had then stood in the way of that proposal … This is because when their currencies are used by others, it gave them added strength,” he elaborated. The prime minister further said that Malaysia is willing to work with Iran and Turkey in technological fields as it is much more advanced in these areas than other Muslim countries.

12 months ago, crypto derivatives platform Bybit officially launched. The Singapore exchange, which also has offices in Hong Kong and Taiwan, has enjoyed a fruitful first year, attracting users from North America, Europe, Russia and Asia. With products including BTC, ETH, XRP and EOS perpetual contracts, and a matching engine capable of handling 100,000 tps, Bybit is looking to carry its success into 2020 and beyond. CEO Ben Zhou spoke to news.Bitcoin.com about its successes, challenges, and aspirations.

Building a Thriving Exchange Bit by Bit

Although 2019 will go down as a successful year for Bybit according to Ben Zhou, is has not been all plain sailing up to this point. While undoubtedly a cause for celebration, a growing user base presents its own difficulties – particularly since Bybit prides itself on no overloads or downtime, plus round-the-clock multilingual customer support.

“Keeping up with the growth both from a technical standpoint and internal management is the biggest challenge that we have faced,” admits Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit. “Because we’ve experienced over 100x growth from March ’18 to November ’19, we have had to constantly upgrade our systems to make sure we have no overloads and system lags.

“We’ve also had to stay on top of recruitment, sourcing the right talent to make sure we provide the best customer support and localization to our various markets. Thankfully, our efforts have paid off: we haven’t had any server downtimes, no overloads during volatility and low latency trading.”

New Frontiers in a Highly Competitive Market

In a bid to attract yet more day traders to its platform, Bybit has recently added Korean as a supported language, with English, Chinese, traditional Chinese and Japanese already in place. This internationalist outlook is very much at the heart of the business, which is looking to expand into new foreign markets in the New Year.

“We’re planning to move into the Thai, Vietnamese and Spanish markets as well as Turkey in 2020,” says Zhou, who spent seven years managing the Greater China region at Forex brokers XM before launching Bybit. It’s experience which makes his view on China’s attitude towards blockchain all the more interesting. In October, President Xi said the country had to “seize the opportunities” presented by blockchain. And that’s exactly what it appears to be doing, with over 500 blockchain projects already registered with the government.

“China is going full force with blockchain technology and will soon openly embrace the technology in many public channels,” Zhou predicts. “At the same time, the government is cracking down on illegal ICOs and scams, which is a positive thing for the whole space in China. The purge will get rid of the scam projects and leave the ones that are actually contributing to the space.

“Bybit has never had an ICO and doesn’t accept any fiat currency. We also banned Chinese IPs in compliance with the government until we get clear indicators that the laws and regulations have changed.”

Decentralization and Derivatives

If 2019 was the year of defi lending, 2020 could well be the year of defi derivatives. The Synthetix protocol has already gained traction, being described as a decentralized iteration of the popular derivatives exchange BitMex. Does Zhou see decentralization as a path Bybit may go down?

“We plan to commission our research team to delve into blockchain technology and brainstorm how we may apply it to the derivatives market. This is an exciting new initiative that could bring about some really novel changes. The team will conduct in-depth market analysis and report on the whole industry to provide more value to the space. Who knows, we might even decentralize part of the exchange or wallet to start with.”

Taking such steps could be a necessity rather than a luxury; while the crypto derivatives market is still relatively new, it is heating up. Binance recently took an equity stake in FTX exchange, having acquired JEX back in September. Huobi and Okex are also looking to cement their positions in the market. In the year to come, Zhou intends to add functionality and promote education to ensure Bybit stands out from the crowd.

What’s in Store for 2020?

“One of the main things we are excited about pushing in the first quarter of 2020 is a linear contract. That would be in addition to our current inverse trading contracts. The linear contracts will be settled in USDT with portfolio margin functionalities to allow full account-wide usage of the available margin, and allow users to utilize the unrealized PnL as margin for more positions.

“On top of this, we’ll also offer the ability to hedge within the position area. So instead of merging the long and short as is the case with our inverse contract, we’ll separate the long and short positions and allow traders to have both at the same time.”

Although blogs about crypto derivatives are easy to come across, Zhou says full-fledged educational resources don’t exist – and it’s an oversight he intends to rectify.

“Honestly, I haven’t seen any systematic programs that focus on derivatives traders from Beginner to Advanced, and this is something we’d like to offer our traders so that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow.

“We’ll soon be launching a space where expert traders, thought leaders or just savvy crypto enthusiasts can share and educate fellow traders in one space. In the long term, we want to create value for our traders beyond just trading, and we hope to create a community that is actively engaging and educating one another.”

Audacious predictions are par for the course in the crypto space, but given the many famous fails we’ve witnessed in the past decade, the focus for CEOs like Zhou must be on getting the basics right: growing their user base, keeping funds and data safe and providing outstanding customer service. This is something he appears to acknowledge, while issuing solid predictions for the coming year:

BTC will once again be the strongest in 2020, whereas altcoins will continue to rely on BTC’s price stability to see any significant growth. Tokenized securities will need a massive breakthrough if they are to live up to the hype while shitcoins will continue to fade into oblivion. Ultimately, I am very bullish about crypto in the long run.

The rhymes of the history.","Share this article

From 2018 onwards, new stablecoins have been pouring onto the markets. Although many are straightforward fiat-collateralized variants on the original stablecoin, Tether, many other projects are also innovating on the stablecoin concept. Therefore, this guide categorizes and explains the different types of stablecoins on the market today.

The Rising Popularity of Stablecoins

One reason that stablecoins have become so prevalent over the last couple of years is, quite simply, that there’s a demand for them. A Binance report published in November 2019 indicated that around 96 percent of institutions surveyed were using stablecoins, predominantly fiat-backed.

Although the report didn’t elaborate on how the stablecoins are used, it seems most likely that they represent a fast and inexpensive alternative to fiat deposits and withdrawals and a means of avoiding Bitcoin’s volatility. This is also how they became popular among retail exchange users, particularly on exchanges that don’t offer the opportunity to purchase crypto with fiat.

Currently, few stablecoins have any kind of regulated status. Those that do, such as Gemini Dollar and TrueUSD, have obtained it on a voluntary basis. However, the regulatory status of stablecoins could soon change, based on recent statements from agencies such as FinCEN that stablecoins represent a form of money transmission. If this happens, users of stablecoins may find themselves subject to know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering checks.

Types of Stablecoins

By definition, a stablecoin is a token designed with stability in mind. How that stability is achieved is where stablecoins vary. Although there are now dozens of different types of them in circulation, they all fall into one of three broad categories: collateralized stablecoins, non-collateralized stablecoins and hybrid coins.

Collateralized Stablecoins

Collateralized Stablecoins can be split into four sub-categories.

Fiat-Backed Stablecoins

Fiat-backed stablecoins are simply tokens whose value is pegged to and backed by, reserves of fiat currency. Tether (USDT) was the first stablecoin and introduced the overall concept of a fiat-backed digital currency pegged to the value of the US dollar and backed by reserves representing the total market capitalization.

However, over the years since it launched in 2014, Tether was criticized for its failure to produce any audit documentation that could prove it was fully collateralized by the equivalent US Dollar value. This came to a head in April 2019 after the New York Attorney General issued a court order against Tether’s parent company iFinex. It alleged that Bitfinex used Tether reserves to remain solvent. Technically,Tether is likely to be fully collateralized — though part of it is in the form of debt owed from within the iFinex group.

The incident didn’t topple Tether from its position as the reigning stablecoin of choice, ranking fourth on CoinMarketCap at the time of writing. Nevertheless, if Tether were to sink tomorrow, there’s no guarantee that the company could make good on the total value of its obligations to token holders.

There are plenty of alternatives to choose from that offer a greater degree of transparency. True USD has published its audit documentation confirming reserves. Paxos Standard and Gemini Dollar are both regulated in the state of New York. USD Coin is backed by reserves held in financial institutions.

Although many fiat-backed stablecoins are pegged to a single fiat currency, it doesn’t necessarily have to be so. The plan for Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency was that it would be pegged to a basket of national currencies, similar to the IMF’s Special Drawing Right.

A more recent development in the fiat-backed stablecoin space, and one that will perhaps prove to trump all its predecessors, is the concept of Central Bank Digital Currency. Both the European Central Bank and the People’s Republic of China have been exploring their own versions of a CBDC. Although the idea has its critics, the IMF has recently given cautious approval.

Critics of fiat-backed stablecoins point to the fact that they derive their value from centralized banking systems. Even further, that they undermine the economic principles of cryptocurrencies. From these arguments emerged crypto-backed stablecoins.

Crypto-Backed Stablecoins

Crypto-backed stablecoins are backed by cryptocurrency but use protocols to ensure that the value doesn’t fluctuate with the price of the token backing the stablecoin. Dai is the biggest and best example. The DAI token is pegged to the value of the US dollar and is backed by Ether. DAI holds its price via the Maker smart contract, which creates and destroys MKR tokens in response to fluctuations in the price of ETH.

Maker recently launched multi-collateral Dai tokens, enabling users to stake Basic Attention Token to back DAI.

Crypto-backed stablecoins are less popular than their fiat-backed counterparts. Nevertheless, there are still a few others of note. Synthetix uses a similar methodology to Dai and is also based on Ethereum, although it isn’t as popular. Currently, there is more ETH staked in Maker than any other DeFi project.

Recently, Money on Chain launched the first bitcoin-backed stablecoin, running on the Bitcoin-based RSK smart contract platform. Like DAI, Money on Chain also uses a two-token system, with the Dollar on Chain (DOC) token pegged to the US dollar, and a second token called BitPRO assuming the volatility risk of DOC being backed by BTC.

Crypto-backed stablecoins with Maker, in particular, have proven to be very popular among fans of decentralization and can be a way of earning passive income for anyone wanting to stake the underlying tokens. However, one concern is that if there is suddenly a massive drop in the markets, the coins could end up under-collateralized.

Asset-Backed Stablecoins

Asset-backed stablecoins are underpinned by reserves of assets other than fiat or cryptocurrencies. Although this category is still relatively new, it has the potential to become very broad. These tokens aren’t necessarily pegged to the price of a fiat currency but to the value of their underlying asset.

For example, Venezuela’s famous crypto failure Petro was linked to the price of oil. Digix is backed by and pegged to the price of gold. Similarly, Paxos, the issuer of the Paxos Standard, also offers a gold-backed token called Paxos Gold.

Asset-backed stablecoins are less used as a medium of exchange and more as a way of investing or trading in the underlying asset, without actually having to take physical custody. Furthermore, because asset-backed tokens represent a title of ownership, there may be legal or regulatory implications depending on the jurisdiction.

Non-Collateralized Stablecoins

Also known as algorithmic stablecoins, or seigniorage supply coins, these coins don’t have any underlying asset. They’re somewhat comparable to fiat currencies issued by central banks in that their value is increased or decreased according to supply and demand, as a means of dampening volatility. The difference is that central banks determine the supply for fiat currencies, whereas with a non-collateralized stablecoin, this is performed by an algorithm or a decentralized model of governance based on holder votes.

This type of stablecoin is currently less well-known than the others described above. Bitbay is one example, which combines algorithmic control with voter-based governance.

One reason why these coins have proven less popular than other types of stablecoins is perhaps that they aren’t particularly effective at achieving stability. For example, NuBits, which was a DAO-governed non-collateralized stablecoin, failed after its USD peg broke several times. The lack of reserve means that there is nothing to hedge against a sudden drop in demand.

Hybrid Stablecoins

Hybrid stablecoins allege to combine the best of all stablecoin features, by offering a mix of reserve backing for a token that also uses algorithms or voting to offset volatility. However, they are often structured in quite a complex way.

Boreal, the stablecoin issued by Auroradao (now rebranded under IDEX), is one example of a hybrid stablecoin. It’s backed by a combination of ETH reserves and loans, with the price managed by Decentralized Capital, the decentralized bank of IDEX ecosystem.

Another example, more centralized and more recently launched, is Saga. It’s an ambitious project, tipped as a rival to Facebook’s Libra, and with an advisory team that includes Nobel Laureate in Economics Myron Scholes. The ERC-20 Saga token is pegged to the IMF SDR and will initially be backed by reserves. However, the project foresees that over time, the value of the token will be determined solely by the underlying smart contract.

The stablecoin space is evolving fast. However, it seems unlikely that the market can sustain the sheer number of new tokens that have appeared over the last two years, particularly in the fiat-backed category. Perhaps regulation may cause some to drop away, or perhaps market forces may come into play and squeeze out the lesser-used coins. Either way, it seems there is plenty of appetite for stablecoins as an asset class, meaning the successful tokens stand a good chance of lasting well into the future.",,,,

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China may debut the breakout fintech innovation of 2020. Beijing is primed to launch the world’s first digital sovereign currency. The initial roll out looks cautious, focusing on consumer spending. Deploying the new technology more widely in the country’s banking system could be the disruptive next step.

A 2019 survey from the Bank of International Settlements found that 70% of the world’s major monetary authorities are studying their own digital versions of money. The People’s Bank of China, worried about private alternatives like Facebook’s Libra and Bitcoin, is likely to be the first major economy to launch its own.

Details are scarce, but Mu Changchun, the head of the PBOC’s digital currency research institute, hinted in November that an “e-yuan” will be distributed via commercial banks, Tencent, and Alibaba-backed Ant Financial, national giants of online payments. Mobile wallet users will hardly notice the difference.

But the underlying distributed ledger technology - essentially, a shared database that is constantly synchronised by a network of computers - would give authorities unprecedented ability to track and monitor online spending flows. That could arm watchdogs with a powerful tool against fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.

Using digital currency in wholesale financial markets would make interbank settlements and other transactions more efficient and secure. Putting it to work in the more backwards corners of China’s financial system could also aid efforts to clean up 2.4 trillion yuan ($341 billion) of officially recognised bad debt.

One of China’s biggest problems, for example, is the illegal but widespread practice of pledging the same asset - bonds, deposit certificates, and shares - as collateral for multiple loans. Distributed ledgers could be more effective at detecting this practice than traditional databases used elsewhere. Many local businesses also still trade so-called discounted banker’s acceptance notes as cash-in-kind. Digitising these pieces of paper would also reduce fraud risk.

Rushing into the initiative would be risky but with President Xi Jinping backing blockchain, officials will have to deliver something. The PBOC will become China’s next fintech star.

Scott Army is the founder and CEO of digital asset manager Vision Hill Group. The following is a summary of the report: “An Institutional Take on the 2019/2020 Digital Asset Market.”

No. 1: There’s bitcoin, and then there’s everything else.

The industry is currently segmented into two main categories: bitcoin and everything else. “Everything else” includes: Web3 innovation, Decentralized Finance (“DeFi”), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, smart contract platforms, security tokens, digital identity, data privacy, gaming, enterprise blockchain or distributed ledger technology, and much more.

Non-crypto natives are seldom aware there are multiple blockchains. Bitcoin, by virtue of it being the first blockchain network brought into the mainstream and by being the largest digital asset by market capitalization, is often the first stop for many newcomers and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

No. 2: Bitcoin is perhaps market beta, for now.

In traditional equity markets, beta is defined as a measure of volatility, or unsystematic risk an individual stock possesses relative to the systematic risk of the market as a whole. The difficulty in defining “market beta” in a space like digital assets is that there is no consensus for a market proxy like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones. Since the space is still very early in its development, and bitcoin has dominant market share (~68 percent at the time of writing), bitcoin is often viewed as the obvious choice for beta, despite the drawbacks of defining “market beta” as a single asset with idiosyncratic tendencies.

Bitcoin’s size and its institutionalization (futures, options, custody, and clear regulatory status as a commodity), have enabled it to be an attractive first step for allocators looking to get exposure (both long and short) to the digital asset market, suggesting that bitcoin is perhaps positioned to be digital asset market beta, for now.

No. 3: Despite slow conversion, substantial progress was made on growing institutional investor interest in 2019.

Education, education, education. Blockchain technology and digital assets represent an extraordinarily complex asset class – one that requires a non-trivial time commitment to undergo a proper learning curve. While handfuls of institutions have already started to invest in the space, a very small amount of institutional capital has actually made it in (relative to the broader institutional landscape), gauged by the size of the asset class and the public market trading volumes. This has led many to repeatedly ask: “when will the herd actually come?”

The reality is that institutional investors are still learning – slowly getting comfortable – and this process will continue to take time. Despite educational progress through 2019, some institutions are wondering if it’s too early to be investing in this space, and whether they can potentially get involved in investing in digital assets in the future and still generate positive returns, but in ways that are de-risked relative to today.

Despite a few other challenges imposed on larger institutional allocators with respect to investing in digital assets, true believers inside these large organizations are emerging, and the processes for forming a digital asset strategy are either getting started or already underway.

No. 4: Long simplicity, short complexity

Another trend we observed emerge this year was a shift away from complexity and toward simplicity. We saw significant growth in simple, passive, low-cost structures to capture beta. With the lowest-friction investor adoption focused on the largest liquid asset in the space – bitcoin – the proliferation of single asset vehicles has increased. These private vehicles are a result of delayed approval of an official bitcoin ETF by the SEC.

We also observed a growing institutional appetite for simpler hedge fund and venture fund structures. For the last several years, many fundamental-focused crypto-native hedge funds operated hybrid structures with the use of side-pockets that enabled a barbell strategy approach to investing in both the public and private digital asset markets. These hedge funds tend to have longer lock-up periods – typically two or three years – and low liquidity. While this may be attractive from an opportunistic perspective, the reality is it’s quite complicated from an institutional perspective for reporting purposes.

No. 5: Active management has been challenged but differentiated sources of alpha are emerging.

For the year-to-date period ended Q3 2019, active managers were collectively up 30 percent on an absolute return basis according to our tracking of approximately 50 institutional-quality funds, compared to bitcoin being up 122 % over the same time period.

Bitcoin’s performance this year, particularly in Q2 2019, has made it clear that its parabolic ascents challenge the ability of active managers to outperform bitcoin during the windows they occur. Active managers generally need to justify the fees they charge investors by outperforming their benchmark(s), which are often beta proxies, yet at the same time they need to avoid imprudent risk behavior that can potentially have swift and sizable negative effects on their portfolios.

Interestingly, active management performance from the beginning of 2018 consistently outperformed passively holding bitcoin (with the exception of “opportunistic” managers who also take advantage of yield and staking opportunities, as of May 2019). This is largely due to various risk management techniques used to mitigate the negative performance drawdowns experienced throughout the extended market sell-off in 2018.

Source: Vision Hill Group

Although 2019 has challenged the large-scale success of these alpha strategies, they are nonetheless in the process of proving themselves out through various market cycles, and we expect this to be a growing theme in 2020.

No. 6: Token value accrual: Transitioning from subjective to objective

At the end of Q3 2019, according to dapp.com, there were 1,721 decentralized applications built on top of ethereum, with 604 of them actively used – more than any other blockchain. Ethereum also had 1.8 million total unique users, with just under 400,000 of them active – also more than any other blockchain. Yet, despite all this growing network activity, the value of ETH has remained largely flat throughout most of 2019 and is on track to end the year down approximately 10 percent at the time of writing (by comparison, BTC has nearly doubled in value over the same period). This begs the question: is ETH adequately capturing the economic value of the ethereum network’s activity, and DeFi in particular?

A new fundamental metric was introduced earlier this year by Chris Burniske – the Network Value to Token Value (“NVTV”) ratio – to ascertain whether the value of all assets anchored into a platform can be greater than the value of the base platform’s asset.

The ETH NVTV ratio has steadily declined throughout the last few years. There are likely to be several reasons for this, but I think one theory summarizes it best: most applications and tokens built and issued atop ethereum may be parasitic. ETH token holders are paying for the security of all these applications and tokens, via the inflation rate that is currently given to the miners – dilution for ETH holders, but not for holders of ethereum-based tokens.

This is not a bullish or bearish statement on ETH; rather it is an observation of early signs of network stack value capture in the space.

No. 7: Money or not, software-powered collateral economies are here.

Another trend we observed this year is a larger migration away from “cryptocurrencies” in an ideological currency (e.g., money/payment and a means of exchange) sense, and toward digital assets for financial applications and economic utility. A form of economic utility that took the stage this year is the notion of software-powered collateral economies. People generally want to hold assets with disinflationary or deflationary supply curves, because part of their promise is that they should store value well. Smart contracts enable us to program the characteristics of any asset, thus it is not irrational to assume that it’s only a matter of time until traditional collateral assets get digitized and put to economic use on blockchain networks.

The benefit of digital collateral is it can be liquid and economically productive in its nature while at the same time serving its primary purpose (to collateralize another asset), yet without possessing the risks of traditional rehypothecation. If assets can be allocated for multiple purposes simultaneously, with the risks appropriately managed, we should see more liquidity, lower cost of borrowing, and more effective allocation of capital in ways the traditional world may not be able to compete with.

No. 8: Network lifecycles: An established supply side meets a quiet but emerging demand side.

Supply side services in digital asset networks are services provided by a third party to a decentralized network in exchange for compensation allocated by that network. Examples include mining, staking, validation, bonding, curation, node operation and more, done to help bootstrap and grow these networks. Incentivizing the supply side is important in digital assets to facilitate their growth early in their lifecycles, from initial fundraising and distribution through the bootstrapping phase to eventual mainnet launches.

While there has been significant growth of this supply side of the equation in 2019 from funds, companies, and developers, the open question is how and when demand for these services will pick up. Our view is that as developer infrastructure continues to mature and activity begins to move “up the stack” toward the application layer, more obvious manifestations of product-market fit are likely to emerge with cleaner and simpler interfaces that will attract high volumes of users in the process. In essence, it is important to build the necessary infrastructure first (the supply side) to enable buy-in from the end users of those services (the demand side).

No. 9: We are in the late innings of the smart contract wars.

While ethereum leads the space on adoption and moves closer to executing on its scalability initiatives, dozens of smart contract competitors fundraised in the market throughout 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to dethrone Ethereum. A handful have formally launched their chains and operate in mainnet as of the end of 2019, while many others remain in testnet or have stalled in development.

What’s been particularly interesting to observe is the accelerative pace of innovation – not just technologically, but economically (incentive mechanisms) and socially (community building) as well. We expect many more smart contract competitors operating privately as of Q4 2019 to launch their mainnets in 2020. Thus, given the incoming magnitude of publicly observable experimentations throughout 2020, if a smart contract platform does not launch in 2020, it is likely to become disadvantageously positioned relative to the rest of the landscape as it relates to capturing substantial developer mindshare and future users and creating defensible network effects.

No. 10: Product-market fit is coming, if not already here.

We don’t think human and financial capital would have continued pouring into the digital asset space in such great magnitude over the last several years if there wasn’t a focus on solving at least one very clear problem. The questionable sustainability of modern monetary theory is one of them, and Ray Dalio of Bridgerwater Associates has been quite vocal about it. Big Tech centralization is another. There are also growing global concerns related to data privacy and identity. And let’s not forget cybersecurity. The list goes on. We are at the tip of the iceberg as it relates to the products and applications blockchain technology enables, and mainstream users will come with growing manifestations of product-market fit. As more time and attention gets spent on diagnosing problems and working on solutions, the industry will begin to achieve its full potential. Facebook’s Libra and Twitter’s Bluesky initiative confirm that as an industry we are heading in the right direction.

A 2020 look ahead

We see 2020 shaping up to be one of the brightest years on record for the digital asset industry. To be clear, this is not a price forecast; if we exclusively measured the health of the industry from a fundamental progress perspective, by various accounts and measures we should have been in a raging bull market for the last two years, and that has not been the case. Rather, we expect 2020 to be a year of accelerated industry maturation.

Source: Vision Hill Group","Why Quantum Computing’s Threat to Crypto May Be Further out Than Previously Thought

According to one researcher, quantum computing faces more hurdles than many realize when it comes to achieving viability in breaking encryption. In a recent report Dr. Subhash Kak, Regents Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oklahoma State University, notes that there are issues such as “noise” and error correction that render the buzz about quantum supremacy when it comes to Bitcoin, still largely theoretical.

Also Read: What Google’s Quantum Breakthrough Means for Blockchain Cryptography

Where Quantum Supremacy Falls Short

In essence “quantum supremacy” refers to the demonstration that a quantum computer can solve some problem classical computers can’t. There’s no doubt this has been done, but the important question for those in the crypto space centers on what kind of problem is being solved. While the development of quantum supremacy is a haunting specter indeed for hodlers worried about their private keys, there’s yet little evidence the problems being solved by this technology have much utility in cracking encryption where cryptos are concerned.

“These companies are trying to build hardware that replicates the circuit model of classical computers. However, current experimental systems have less than 100 qubits. To achieve useful computational performance, you probably need machines with hundreds of thousands of qubits,” states Dr. Subhash Kak in a recent article.

Though groups like D-wave boast 2000 qubits (quantum bits) the applications are different. D-wave’s focus is on optimization via a process called quantum annealing which, according to Kak, is a “narrower approach to quantum computing … where qubits are used to speed up optimization problems.” As such, D-wave’s claims have garnered some criticism, with one recent report on the topic calling the D-wave system “skim milk” compared to other computers.

Noise and Error Correction

The real difficulty in achieving practical quantum code-cracking resides in the concepts of noise and error correction, according to Kak. The researcher details:

“For computers to function properly, they must correct all small random errors. In a quantum computer, such errors arise from the non-ideal circuit elements and the interaction of the qubits with the environment around them.”

For these reasons the qubits can lose coherency in a fraction of a second and, therefore, the computation must be completed in even less time. If random errors – which are inevitable in any physical system – are not corrected, the computer’s results will be worthless.

This error correction complicates things even more. The potential for noise-related errors necessitates the need for more qubit power. Theoretical physicist Mikhail Dyakonov describes the mind-boggling nature of the problem, saying:

“While a conventional computer with N bits at any given moment must be in one of its 2N possible states, the state of a quantum computer with N qubits is described by the values of the 2N quantum amplitudes, which are continuous parameters (ones that can take on any value, not just a 0 or a 1). This is the origin of the supposed power of the quantum computer, but it is also the reason for its great fragility and vulnerability.

So the number of continuous parameters describing the state of such a useful quantum computer at any given moment … is much, much greater than the number of subatomic particles in the observable universe.

In other words, the strength of practical quantum computing can also be seen as its Achilles heel. Because it can process so many variables, these seemingly endless variables also open the door for greater potential error. Resulting hardware and logistical considerations are not as often discussed as other issues, but according to the two researchers these areas are of critical importance.

Looking Past the Hype

Dyakonov, like Kak, points to the hype surrounding the field of quantum computing, which has been in development and a source of energized speculation for decades. While it is unclear exactly how far classified government and high-level scientific developments may have come by now, as far as the educated observer can tell, it seems there’s a long way to go before the Bitcoin network may be in danger. At which point algorithmic upgrades have been suggested by many as a potential solution.

Still, like ongoing work in nuclear fusion, quantum computing is not to be ignored. An unforeseen breakthrough could theoretically happen at any time and change the game. Kak, for his part, remains skeptical: “As someone who has worked on quantum computing for many years, I believe that due to the inevitability of random errors in the hardware, useful quantum computers are unlikely to ever be built.”

Researchers at the Big Four accounting firm Deloitte say 4 million Bitcoin worth about $28.6 billion are especially vulnerable to attack from quantum computers.

According to a new research report from the firm, BTC that’s held in “pay to public key” (p2pk) addresses are at a higher risk of quantum attack because their public keys – which could theoretically be used to derive a private key – are exposed on the ledger by default. These types of addresses were utilized in the early days of Bitcoin, before a new standard was implemented.

That new standard is called p2pkh (pay to a public key hash), and only exposes public keys the moment any amount of BTC is sent from an address.

The analysis indicates that BTC that has been sent to a new, modern p2pkh address with zero outgoing transactions is inherently far less susceptible to attack.

Quantum computers exploit the unusual properties of quantum mechanics, using atoms and molecules to create systems that can simultaneously explore multiple possible solutions to a problem, rapidly producing answers.

One day, quantum tech may be powerful enough to crack the encryption schemes that keep crypto assets as well as the internet secure. But the debate over a time frame and the exact number of years it could take for the technology to become sophisticated enough to crack modern cryptography continues.

Deloitte also highlights ongoing attempts to create new methods of cryptography that are resistant to quantum attack and could one day be integrated into the leading crypto assets.

“Even if everyone takes the same protection measures, quantum computers might eventually become so fast that they will undermine the Bitcoin transaction process. In this case the security of the Bitcoin blockchain will be fundamentally broken.

The only solution in this case is to transition to a new type of cryptography called ‘post-quantum cryptography’, which is considered to be inherently resistant to quantum attacks. These types of algorithms present other challenges to the usability of blockchains and are being investigated by cryptographers around the world.”

In October, Google proclaimed it achieved quantum supremacy. The company says it has built a quantum computer powerful enough to perform a complex computation in about three minutes. A supercomputer performing the same task would need roughly 10,000 years.

Startups need users but getting users can be difficult if the startup offers something new and unfamiliar to the market. Users need to see how the startup’s product or service will benefit them before they change their behaviors.

That’s where lighthouse customers come in.

Lighthouse customers are early adopters whose successes attract other customers. Like a lighthouse guiding a ship to port, lighthouse customers guide potential customers through an uncertain buying process. The success of the lighthouse customers assuage the buyer’s fears the startup’s products won’t work or will make things worse.

In some ways, adoption in the crypto markets over the last few years has been disappointing. The frenzy of 2017 and 2018 promised a dismantling of legacy institutions and a wholesale replacement by utopian token networks. This promise connected into the belief that institutional investors were to arrive in herds, buying up all the digital assets in sight. Instead, we saw relatively little demand for “dapps” and a conspicuous lack of coin-buying herds.

Startups didn’t see lighthouses, only storms and shipwrecks.

I attribute some of this trepidation to a lack of lighthouses.

The best developers in the world will start to build on blockchains when they see companies creating real value, serving real customers and making real money. Instead, this year they saw a cacophony of debate about core infrastructure, failed research and development, and a number of “creative” capital formation experiments. They didn’t see lighthouses, only storms and shipwrecks.

Similarly, for institutions to really get involved in crypto they needed to see other institutions succeed at either allocating to the asset class or building on top of blockchain infrastructure. Trusted brands needed to offer tools like custody, pensions and endowments allocating to funds. Instead, they saw several false starts for a BTC ETF, muted allocations from the largest institutions and a lot of announcements about enterprise blockchains. But there were few, if any, signals of adoption.

But as I look into next year I see flashes of light. Across the industry I’ve found functioning lighthouses that can serve as a welcome for the next wave of users, developers, investors and customers.

On the application side, second-generation wallets such as Argent and Torus have made dramatic user experience improvements, lowering the barrier to entry for everyday users. For example, logging into Web3 applications using Torus is indistinguishable from the login flow for Web2 applications. Games like God’s Unchained and Skyweaver have introduced hundreds of thousands of gamers to digital assets through fun and rewarding gameplay. Crypto native browsers, namely Brave, with more than 10 million monthly active users, are taking off, creating a seamless gateway to all of the above. Permissionless financial systems including MakerDAO, Uniswap and Compound give people alternative ways to save, invest and manage their cash. For one of the brightest lighthouses of the year, look to Mariano Conti’s Devcon presentation where he shared how he lives entirely off a financial system he helped build, thereby sheltering his family from Argentina’s 50 percent inflation.

In addition to “crypto native” applications, we’re starting to see industry bets where founders are leveraging blockchain infrastructure to do things that were otherwise impossible in their sectors. For example, Helium uses crypto to incentivize a network of users to operate hotspots for wireless connectivity and Figure uses crypto to cut down the costs of originating home equity loans. These are businesses with the potential to reach massive markets.

On the institutional side, we are seeing institutional-grade products like Tagomi (prime brokerage), Coinbase Custody (custody) and Bakkt (futures exchange) hit the market. Despite the slow start, volumes are picking up. Bakkt’s monthly futures product has traded more than $120 million in only three months since launch. Pension funds and endowments have started allocating to crypto funds, showing the way for other institutional investors. Now, if institutions want to allocate money to crypto they don’t ask “How?” Instead, they can ask “How much?”

In terms of overall awareness — and this is a big one that’s chronically ignored — despite the relatively rough performance of the asset class for practically all of 2019, cryptocurrencies were discussed in mainstream media all over the world thanks to the Libra congressional hearings and China’s declared intentions to lead the world in blockchain innovation.","Jeremy Clark

Bitcoin (BTC) officially turns 11 on January 3, 2020. As the token enters its third decade, how does one of the first few academics to ever write a paper on BTC see the future of Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation?

Jeremy Clark, associate professor and the NSERC/Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton (RCGT)/Catallaxy Industrial Research Chair in Blockchain Technologies at the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, tells Cryptonews.com all about BTC’s academic past, present – and future.

How did you first get involved in Bitcoin and blockchain technology?

When I was at university, I was really into cellular automata. My friend (and now my research colleague) was into encryption. We agreed to combine our interests for a final year project and I got hooked!

A year or so later, I met one of the founders of the whole movement, David Chaum. David invented the concept of digital cryptocurrencies when I was still in diapers!

We began working together on secure voting-related projects. I found the subject amazing because I realized that it was both highly technical and could have a real social impact.

You could design protocols and write code, but then later you would talk to policymakers and election officials. Ultimately, I got to see people casting votes using the system we had created!

How did you react when you first came across Bitcoin?

To be honest, back then, most online crypto-hangouts – including the cryptography mailing list that the Bitcoin white paper was posted to – were full of half-baked ideas about creating digital currencies.

So, embarrassingly perhaps, I did not look deep enough into it to see anything different about Bitcoin. But after I had heard my colleagues mention it a few times, my ears pricked up. And when I came to understand one of its key components, the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, I immediately understood how it solved a problem I had been working on myself.

Eventually, I ended up authoring one of the very first academic papers ever to be published on Bitcoin (the third by my count). Now, of course, there are hundreds of Bitcoin-themed papers being published every year.

You began teaching a course on Bitcoin and Blockchain at Concordia in fall last year. How did the University react when you told them you were going to teach students about Bitcoin?

They were excited! It was the first course on the subject to be taught at a Canadian university, as far as I know. For every enrolled student, there was one non-enrolled member of the community that just wanted to audit the course. We had trouble fitting everyone into the room!

This inspired me, so the second time around, I decided to record the lectures and post them on YouTube so that everyone could watch them.

Do you think crypto-related subjects will become more popular in the future – and could students in non-IT-related subjects end up studying about Bitcoin and blockchain?

Absolutely. In fact, that’s already happening! We have a course in engineering here at Concordia. The subject is also covered in at least one of our business school’s courses. The University of Ottawa’s law school also has a crypto-related course. The University of British Columbia has offerings for Library Sciences.

Major American universities like MIT and Cornell have dedicated research centers, and Bitcoin/blockchain-related subjects are covered in multiple faculties and departments.

Are blockchain technology and Bitcoin protocol essential subjects for students in 2019?

I think these subjects are too much of a niche for one to say, for example, that every computer science undergraduate needs an entire course devoted to them. However, I think that undergrads should be exposed to these ideas at some point. And I think they are very fitting for graduate-level study, particularly in computer science, information systems engineering and financial engineering.

One of your main areas of interest is the application of IT in voting systems. How close are we to seeing blockchain-powered democracy?

I always say that voting is a very hard problem to solve from a security perspective. If you have 10 problems to solve, blockchain solves the eighth on the list. In other words, it isn’t a panacea. To be honest, I like paper. I know it isn’t always realistic to hand-count paper ballots in large, municipal elections, but I would still like to see a system that makes use of paper-based ballots.

Perhaps optical scanning technology could be applied to create a digital audit trail on a blockchain for verifiability purposes.

We should also have mandatory risk-limiting audits for paper ballots after elections. Ten years ago, while working on a large research team, I co-designed a system called Scantegrity, which would be appropriate for this.

In fact, you can find cryptographic proofs on the Bitcoin blockchain proving the integrity of a municipal election we ran using the system.

You currently hold the NSERC/RCGT/Catallaxy Industrial Research Chair in Blockchain Technologies. What does that position entail?

This is a five-year collaboration with Catallaxy and its parent company RCGT. I am supervising a team of students who are working on the project. Over this long timeframe, we can really integrate with the company and its operations.

We will look for research opportunities and bring our own expertise to the table. Blockchain is new and evolving, and firms like Catallaxy want to be at the cutting edge of knowledge and sharing experience with clients.

You might think it sounds like science fiction for a firm to turn up with a balance sheet full of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But there are actually quite a few companies like this now in Canada.

To audit financial statements, auditors like RCGT need to be sure that a firm’s assets actually exist, that these are actually owned by the firm in question and that they are protected by adequate security networks. They also need to determine a fair market value for the assets.

While all of these problems begin as auditing issues, they often include matters that require a deeper understanding of the technology, its capabilities and its limitations.

What do you predict for the future of Bitcoin?

I grew up reading Wired magazine, which is often full of bold predictions about the future. But go back and read any issue from the 1990s, and you’ll quickly realize that the future is nearly impossible to predict.

Things often progress in a more conventional manner than one might expect, although there is always space for a few surprises!

As such, I’m hesitant to predict anything about the future of Bitcoin.

That said, but I will make two points: Firstly, the underlying technology is here to stay.

And, secondly, Bitcoin needs to solve a few adaptability issues if it wants to retain its market dominance. One of those issues is exchange rate stability. Maybe this issue will be resolved organically if speculators leave the BTC market. But it is more likely to happen through the emergence of a competing cryptocurrency.

____","This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Diogo Monica is president and co-founder of Anchorage, crypto’s premier custodian for institutional investors.

The last few years have seen the formation of many crypto-focused hedge funds and venture capital funds, whose collective assets under management total in the billions of dollars: institutional investors including Blockchain Capital, BlockTower, Paradigm and Polychain, among others. These funds know the blockchain ecosystem as well as anyone in the world.

We’re grateful institutional investors who know crypto best are helping to inform the development of our custody product. Clients tell us what they need, and we partner with them to build what they require. Through this process, we’ve learned some lessons worth sharing because they offer meaningful insight into the crypto space and how it’s evolving.

1. Institutional investors want more from their custodian

Because digital assets are bearer assets, most investment activities involve handling the underlying private keys. This means custody plays a much bigger role in crypto investors’ day-to-day operations than in traditional finance. Whatever investors want to do with their assets – buy and hold, exit a major position, actively trade, participate in staking and governance – the custodian will be involved.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

As such, institutional investors want custodians to make buying and selling digital assets as easy and painless as possible. What’s typically a multi-step process, including navigating exchanges and OTC dealers, finding the best price, manually transferring crypto from or to custody, is ripe for disruption by custodians. Regulated trading involves custody and custody relies on technology, which means providing even simple financial services (like the ability to buy, hold and sell an asset) requires highly advanced underlying infrastructure in the custody function.

Funds and institutions should be able to focus on their investment strategies without having to worry about security or moving millions of dollars in crypto between addresses. The onus is on custodians to enable their clients to sell or buy directly through custody.

2. Cold storage isn’t working for institutional use cases

Institutional investors are painfully aware of the major hot wallet breaches our industry has suffered and the chilling effect they’ve had on the whole ecosystem. To counteract the risks of online exposure, custodians have attempted to secure assets by generating and managing keys entirely offline through a manual human process called “cold storage.” Holding assets offline is necessary for security purposes, but institutional investors are frustrated with cold storage as it has traditionally been implemented.

Questioning the practicality of cold storage is not something we at Anchorage take lightly: As project leads for the Glacier Protocol, my co-founder and I helped develop a step-by-step method for bitcoin self-custody that relies on cold storage. Cold storage has been instrumental for the broader adoption of decentralized currencies, allowing people with non-technical backgrounds to safely store their crypto assets offline. It was and continues to be a sensible custody solution for many retail investors.

But cold storage comes with serious usability constraints, and institutional investors have complex usability needs that cold storage simply cannot satisfy.

For one, institutional investors have an obligation to their LPs to generate as much yield as possible on their behalf. Cold storage is an impediment to institutions’ ability to quickly execute trades. When a time-sensitive trading opportunity arises, custodians must be able to ensure that a client’s assets are readily accessible for trading at a moment’s notice. Traditional forms of cold storage can entail hours or even days of waiting to withdraw assets, at which point trading opportunities are lost. Institutional custody providers must develop solutions that make offline assets easily accessible and securely tradeable.

Second, institutional investors are demanding staking and governance, two forms of on-chain participation that require the use of private keys for online operations. Some cold storage custodians rely on delegation and proxy contracts, technologies that enable one key or contract to act on behalf of another. But not all projects allow delegated staking, and proxy contracts can increase surface-of-attack and introduce unnecessary risk.

As more projects come to market with mechanisms requiring active participation, institutional investors, which have a major stake in their investments’ health and success, will rely on their custodians to act accordingly and get the most out of their holdings.

3. Institutional investors require solutions designed for multi-person teams

The fact that institutional funds are managed collectively presents its own set of challenges. While “not your keys, not your crypto” has become a common refrain among adherents to the value of self-sovereignty, which individual should ultimately control crypto keys owned by an institutional fund?

We believe the keys must be controlled by a multi-person team. Providers are using different solutions to achieve this result: some use Shamir’s Secret Sharing (a cryptography algorithm that divides keys into multiple parts), others use physical controls. We at Anchorage associate a unique key with each user and require all sensitive operations to be signed by a quorum of user keys.

But multi-person approval is only part of the solution. The custodian must verify institutional intent – in other words, the custodian must ensure that a given operation represents what the client organization wants to do, and not just what a rogue individual or rogue group wants to do. We believe institutional intent is best verified by authenticating each human approver for a given operation, not just verifying possession of a shard or user key; and by enabling institutional investors to configure customizable quorums based on the nature of the operation, since different team members may have different domains of authority.

In sum, the role of custodians is evolving as the crypto ecosystem matures.","The Iranian President has proposed the development of a Muslim cryptocurrency as a tool against the economic dominance enjoyed by the United States. In a recent inter-state meeting, President Hassan Rouhani also called on Muslim nations to unite financially as this is the only weapon that can help them combat ‘bully’ U.S.

President Rouhani was addressing heads of state from other Muslim nations in a recent event in Malaysia, the Associated Press reported. He called on the leaders to shun the U.S. dollar, which he believes has been weaponized against Muslim countries.

Iran has been on the receiving end of several U.S. sanctions under the Trump administration. This has caused economic upheavals in the country, leading to violent protests in the past month across the country. These sanctions are unwarranted, Rouhani believes.

He described the U.S. sanctions as “the main tools of domineering hegemony and bullying of other nations.”

“The Muslim world should be designing measures to save themselves from the domination of the United States dollar and the American financial regime,” he stated, saying a Muslim crypto is one of the ways the nations can free themselves.

Malaysia’s long-serving leader, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, supported the idea, echoing President Rouhani’s call for economic independence. This isn’t the first time he has called for an alternative currency, he revealed. His previous calls for an alternative to the U.S. dollar have been shot down by the superpowers, he said.

He stated: “We are hearing this for the first time — that Iran and Turkey are of the opinion that we should use an alternative to the U.S. dollar. We can use our own currencies or have a common currency. It looks like sometimes when we use the U.S. dollar, there are sanctions that can curb economic development.”

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, also echoed the sentiments, urging unity among Muslim nations. Leaders from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Indonesia were also present in the meeting.

The calls for a crypto alternative to the dollar seem to be rising by the day. China is already working on its state-backed crypto. However, according to reports, China’s crypto will mostly cater to the domestic market.

One promising proposal has been that of BRICS, a five-nation organization comprising of Brail, Russia, India, China and South Africa. BRICS proposed a crypto that would target international settlements, helping them avoid the U.S. dollar. The five nations claim they have already reduced USD transactions from 92% to 50% in the past five years and the proposed crypto could completely wipe out USD usage altogether.

2019-12-23,"Uzbekistan Bans Citizens From Buying Crypto, They Can Only Sell

Authorities in Uzbekistan have effectively banned residents from purchasing cryptocurrencies on digital asset exchanges licensed in the country. Crypto holders will only be able to sell their coins and that’s if these have not been obtained through anonymous transactions, amendments to the local regulations postulate.

Uzbekistan Amends Its Crypto Regulations

The Central Asian republic made it to the crypto media headlines last year, when it legalized cryptocurrency trading and introduced licensing for exchanges with a presidential decree issued in the fall of 2018. An earlier decree, signed by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in the summer of that same year, prepared the legal grounds for other activities related to the circulation of digital coins. For a while, the country looked like a promising destination for crypto business.

However, the National Agency for Project Management, which is subordinated to the presidency, has recently adopted amendments to the regulatory regime that significantly limit options for local private individuals using cryptocurrency. According to a new order issued by the agency on Dec. 6, Uzbekistan citizens will only be allowed to sell crypto assets on registered exchanges, Sputink and Forklog reported. Besides, using decentralized cryptos as a means of payment is now prohibited in the country.

On top of that, performing any transactions with coins that have been acquired through anonymous transactions is banned as well, although it remains unclear how regulators will determine whether someone’s digital money has been involved in such transfers. Trading platforms should only serve users with verified identities, who are 18 years or older, and whose names are not on the government’s list of individuals suspected of money laundering and terrorist financing.

Changes Inspired by FATF Standards

Cryptocurrency exchanges have been obliged to keep records of all trades conducted on their platforms for at least five years. Any violations of the country’s laws should also be recorded and reported to Uzbekistan’s law enforcement in writing. According to the media reports, these new requirements have been inspired by the global standards on crypto assets adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in June this year.

Uzbekistan authorities have nevertheless not given up entirely on their initial intention to accommodate crypto businesses in the country. The project management agency under President Mirziyoyev hopes that despite the stringency of the newly adopted rules, the overall regulatory framework will attract fresh foreign investments. The executive power in Tashkent also expects that crypto companies will generate additional revenues for Uzbekistan’s commercial banks that provide services to the sector.

When the crypto industry was granted regulatory recognition last year, Uzbekistan sought to acquire know-how from others with more experience in the field. The government signed an agreement with the Korean Blockchain Business Association which had to help with the implementation of the Uzbekistan Revolution 4.0 project aimed at developing the country’s blockchain space. The cooperation had to lead to the establishment of a national cryptocurrency exchange, industrial mining center, blockchain academy, and the legalization of coin offerings. It’s unclear whether there’s been any substantial progress on this track since then.

The company announced Monday that Chief Product Officer Mike Blandina has become the new CEO of the company, effective Dec. 20. He succeeds outgoing CEO Kelly Loeffler, who was recently appointed to become the next U.S. senator from the state of Georgia. Adam White, the company’s chief operating officer, will serve as the company’s president.

Blandina joined Bakkt in April following stints at PayPal and Google. He comes from a background in payments tech, having been director of engineering at Google’s Wallet project.

White, who was one of Coinbase’s earliest employees, joined Bakkt in October 2018.

Loeffler has run Bakkt since its formal announcement in August 2018, overseeing the company as it worked to launch its physically delivered bitcoin futures products, the first such in the U.S.

Under her tenure, Bakkt also announced it would be launching options on top of its existing futures, as well as cash-settled bitcoin futures through a Singapore-based affiliate.

Both of those products went live earlier this month.

Her successor, Blandina, will continue to oversee Bakkt’s expansion, including the rollout of a consumer-facing retail app meant to facilitate small-item purchases using bitcoin. Starbucks, which was announced as a research partner when Bakkt was first launched in 2018, will be a launch partner for this app.

Bakkt is also expanding its warehouse efforts, recently naming Galaxy Digital as a client for the latter’s new bitcoin funds.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced he would appoint Loeffler to fill current Sen. Johnny Isakson’s seat at the beginning of December, making her the first crypto company executive to serve in the upper chamber of the U.S. legislature. In her introductory remarks, Loeffler praised U.S. President Donald Trump, who wanted Congressman Doug Collins to fill the seat, but did not mention bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.

Loeffler will be sworn into office on Jan. 1, 2020. In a statement released the day her appointment was made official, ICE said she would have to step down from her CEO position during the transition.

Notably, Loeffler appears to be the first ICE executive to hold a “CEO” title at one of the exchange’s subsidiaries. While ICE itself has a CEO in Jeffrey Sprecher, Loeffler’s husband, its subsidiaries appear to be run by presidents or other C-level executives, including ICE Futures US (Trabue Bland), ICE Clear US (Hester Serafini), ICE Data Services (Lynn Martin) and ICE Futures Singapore (Lucas Schmeddes).","Bitcoin (BTC) closed the week up at $7,513 which was a 5.65% increase from the opening price of $7,111. It was a turbulent week with Bitcoin finding new lows for the quarter of $6,430, which invoked an impressive 16% bounce to close the week.

Bitcoin has continued to outperform the other cryptocurrencies, demonstrated by the 7-day performance for Bitcoin recording a 9.19% increase, whereas Ethereum’s Ether token (ETH) has barely moved, while XRP has lost around 5% of its value.

As such, there appears to be a disconnect developing between Bitcoin and the rest of the market.

Bitcoin dominance is closing in on 70% without showing any sign of weakness. The vast majority of the gain in market share has come at the expense of Ethereum and XRP, which lost half their market share to Bitcoin. Put differently, BTC is up 104% for the year compared to Ether’s 2% and XRP, which is down 46%.

Weekly Chart

The 1-week Bitcoin chart shows Bitcoin trading within the full range between the mid-6 and 7,000s last week before finally closing hard up against resistance with a hammer candlestick, a bullish indicator.

The key weekly moving averages of the 50 and 100 remain crossed bullish, with the bulls now trying to reclaim the 50-week moving average (MA). Previous support at $7,600 will be a critical level to be reclaimed before BTC can be considered a bullish trade.

The Weekly On-Balance Volume, or OBV, indicator combined with the basic volume chart demonstrates that there has been a decline in the continued selling seen in the second half of the year, with the last two stand out volume candles pushing the price up rather than down.

The moving average convergence divergence indicator, or MACD, is also continuing to build on its bullish divergence but is likely to need another few weeks to achieve a bullish cross, which would be confirmed.

Monthly chart

A brief visit to the monthly chart as we roll into the final week of 2019 shows that Bitcoin is in the process of forming a bullish pin bar candle, which would be an interesting way to end the year should it be maintained, highlighting buying interest in the $6,000s.

The monthly chart again highlights the importance of the $7,600 level, which is also the monthly open for December.

1-day chart

The daily Bitcoin chart shows the strong 5% move into Sunday’s close, which finally broke the diagonal resistance that has held Bitcoin’s price down for all of December.

Bitcoin is now trading within a well-established volume node at $7,150 and $7,500, where profit taking and short interest appears to have been found as would be expected.

The key moving averages are also trending towards prices representing high levels of trading interest. A bullish breakout would likely be met by resistance at these levels, which are currently $8,200 for the 100 MA and $9,250 for the 200 MA.

The MACD indicator clearly shows a confirmed bullish divergence with the given indicator making higher lows after price found lower lows. The histogram continues to print higher highs recognizing the rate at which the MACD is reaching out towards its zero line, which would be a good indicator for a continuation of the market.

The RSI has also begun trending up over 50, which is also a confirmation of the bullish divergence that was also seen in this indicator.

4-hour chart

Price on Monday appears to be stalling around the $7,550 level, which is to be somewhat expected given the known long-term resistance at this price point and will most likely define the final week in December.

The 4-hour CME chart shows that Bitcoin’s buying volume has been notably higher at the CME when compared to that of the spot market. The CME closed the week at $7,235 and now has a gap to the downside as a result of the 5% move on Sunday.

The recent CME gaps have been resolved within a week in recent times suggesting that a retest of the breakout from the middle of December’s trading range is likely.

BTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

Accumulation

The 4-hour chart clearly reveals that Bitcoin is showing rejection of price below $7,000 with v-shaped reversals and long wicks into the $6,000 price range.

This goes some way to imply that the bulls are absorbing any supply in this price range and is similar to the Wyckoff double bottom schematic requirements.

A breakout of $8,200 would be a sign of strength printing a higher high, which is what is really required to declare that Bitcoin is bullish again 5 months before the halving event.

Still in a downtrend

Despite a promising outlook for Bitcoin, the overwhelming trend is still to the downside following weeks of lower lows and lower highs. While the double-bottom and weekly candles are positive, double-bottoms are there to be broken and in a downtrend, the expectation would be that will be the case sooner or later.

There is also a question over how much absorption there will be by the bulls in the $6,000s and whether a deeper test of liquidity will occur — as well as for the bulls to demonstrate they are able to print higher highs.

Looking forward

Clearly, the final week of December is an important one. If the bulls maintain pressure on resistance, Bitcoin will finish the year up over 100%, clearly outperforming all other major cryptocurrencies and demonstrating another year of impressive gains.

A push by the bears to close a bearish December candle in the $6,000s would dampen some of the positive price action in 2019 and may open the doors for more downside in January 2020.

The Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner told CNBC on Monday that the cannabis sector's performance appears similar to the bitcoin craze and the height of the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century.

Lee didn't go so far as to say that a bubble was bursting in the marijuana sector. But he said the industry reminds him of some of the early internet business models, which he described as a sort of ""profitless prosperity.""

""There might be a growing demand, but until someone can really capture value properly, it's going to be tough to be creating something that generates sustainable return and equity,"" Lee told ""Closing Bell.""

Some analysts have pointed out for a while that the pot industry was reminiscent of bitcoin's run, beginning in 2017.

Like the marijuana sector, cryptocurrency became a huge phenomenon and sparked excitement among investors. Bitcoin skyrocketed from about $3,600 per coin in 2017 to more than $19,000 in December of that year. Throughout 2018, bitcoin plunged, and it closed the year at around $4,000. Bitcoin currently has a market value of a little more than $130 billion.

After the bitcoin craze fizzled, some investors believed cannabis stocks were the next big growth area.

But the pot sector has struggled amid the slow rollout of retail stores in Canada as well as uncertainties related to regulations in the United States.

Shares of the largest marijuana companies soared in 2018 but are all poised to end this year down sharply. Canopy Growth, the world's largest publicly traded cannabis company by market value, has plunged 64% from its all-time highs and is down around 26% for 2019. Tilray is down more than 75% this year, while Aurora Cannabis is nearly 60% lower.

The industry hopes the recent introduction of Cannabis 2.0, marijuana derivatives including edibles and beverages, will create excitement and generate sales.

OneCoin was launched by Ignatova, a Bulgarian national, and according to her LinkedIn profile, a law graduate and former Mckinsey employee.

It claimed to work like any other cryptocurrency whose coins are generated through mining and can then be used to make global payments.

The coin also came with a cryptocurrency wallet and it’s estimated that a total of 120 billion coins would be available on the OneCoin network.

Organizers sold educational materials, including promotional and discounted packages, to network participants.

Educational courses included cryptocurrencies, trading, investments, financial analysis, and asset management.

Users were expected to pay for these programs. In true multi-level-marketing style, participants were also enticed with referral rewards to urge more users to join.

Several reports also suggest OneCoin was a Ponzi scheme and it’s facing legal action in several nations around the globe.

How it claimed to work

Coins were obtained through mining, and OneCoin operated as a centralized network, where organizers allegedly “took care of all technical aspects.”

An explainer video uploaded to its YouTube channel, claims it was a safe “platform for innovation that will change the financial system.”

It was also claimed that the cryptocurrency adhered to Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules to prevent money laundering.

Additionally, the video alleges OneCoin was “the first cryptocurrency with a monthly audit of its blockchain.”

No coins, no blockchains, nada

In reality, though, Police eventually revealed OneCoin Ltd was actually a “multi-level marketing network.”

As previously reported by Hard Fork, OneCoins weren’t actually mined using computer resources. Their worth was actually stipulated by the fraudsters, who “programmed” the coin to increase from €0.50 ($0.56) to approximately €29.95 ($33.68).

We now know that investigators also refuted claims that OneCoin maintained a private blockchain — in fact, police found that it lacked “a true blockchain, that is, public and verifiable.”

The City of London Police share the same belief as foreign law enforcement partners as to the legitimacy of #OneCoin. If you believe you may have been victim of fraud in relation to #OneCoin, or suspect someone of marketing it, please come forward and report to @actionfrauduk. — City of London Police Fraud (@CityPoliceFraud) November 5, 2019

As of March 2015, the fraudsters had been allocating “coins” to members that didn’t actually exist. Authorities say the founders referred to these as “fake coins.”

Some of the websites associated with “cryptocurrency” scam OneCoin were taken offline in December 2019.

Who’s Dr Ruja Ignatova

Ignatova told people she had created a cryptocurrency to rival Bitcoin, persuading them to invest billions.

In June 2016, Dr Ruja Ignatova appeared on stage at in London, England wearing a seemingly expensive ballgown, and long earrings.

At the flashy (read tacky) OneCoin event, Ruja told her adoring fans that OneCoin was the “Bitcoin killer.”

“In two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin any more!” she added.

“OneCoin is easy to use, OneCoin is for everyone […] since we mined our first coin in January 2015, our growth exploded,” Ignatova continued.

Even though OneCoin was alleged to be growing rapidly, and the team intently portrayed an image of success, investors were becoming increasingly concerned.

A long-promised exchange, which would allow users to trade OneCoin into fiat, was constantly delayed. Organizers were due to abate concerns at an event in Lisbon, but Ignatova never showed up.

According to FBI records, Ignatova is thought to have boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens on October 25, 2016. She’s been incommunicative since.

She is charged with securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.

The brother who admitted guilt

Ignatova is still on the run, but her brother pleaded guilty to money laundering and fraud charges and is now facing a maximum of 90 years behind bars.

Konstantin Ignatov, who was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in March, signed a plea deal on October 4, admitting to his role in the multi-billion dollarcryptocurrencyscam.

However, he’s reportedly worried that his admission of guilt would invariably reveal the identification of individuals involved who may seek vengeance against him or his family. For this reason, he may be given a new identity under the US witness protection program.

Ignatov maintains he’s not spoken to his sister since she disappeared and claims to have had hired a private investigator to find her. They have so far been unsuccessful.

The lawyer who laundered millions

Mark Scott, a former USlawyer, has been making headlines ever since the USlaid charges against him, Ignatova, and Ignatov in early March.

Scott, who allegedly made $50 million from re-routing $400 million from the scam, was found guilty of money laundering and fraud and is now facing a possible 50-year prison sentence.

His lawyers maintain that he was unaware that OneCoin’s cryptocurrency was worthless, and claim he was simply following Ignatova’s orders. These claims were rejected by a federal jury in Manhattan, following a three-week trial.

Formerly a partner at legal firm Locke Lord, Scott is believed to have registered a raft of fake companies, offshore accounts, and fraudulent vehicles to launder funds between the end of 2015 and mid-2017.

During court proceedings, Scott claimed that Neil Bush, the brother of former US presidentGeorge W. Bush was paid $300,000 to meet with Ignatova to discuss a $60 million loan to purchase an African oil field using OneCoin cryptocurrency.

Scott is due to be sentenced on February 21, 2020, and is also involved in a separate suit after investors in the US — affected by the scam — decided to sue him for recompense.

It’s not over

Although law enforcement has made progress in terms of arresting and convicting some of those involved, there’s plenty left to be done — and while Ignatova is still roaming free, victims are undoubtedly mourning their losses.

I for one think the OneCoin cryptocurrencyscamwill be one to watch for years to come and should serve as a stark reminder to think before parting with your hard-earned cash.

If this has taught us anything is that when things sound too good to be true, they likely are.","Regulatory Roundup: New US Crypto Bill, France's 1st Approved ICO, Muslim Crypto

In this roundup, we cover a wide range of regulatory developments in the crypto space. Much has transpired in the U.S., including a new crypto bill, SEC’s proposal, lawmakers seeking answers from the IRS, and the state of Michigan signing several crypto bills into law. We also cover France’s first-approved initial coin offering, a proposal for a unified Muslim crypto, India’s plans to produce 20,000 blockchain experts, and more.

New US Crypto Bill, SEC’s Proposal, Letter to IRS

U.S. lawmakers are reportedly discussing a new bill entitled “Crypto-Currency Act of 2020.” Its stated purpose is to “clarify which federal agencies regulate digital assets, to require those agencies to notify the public of any federal licences, certifications, or registrations required to create or trade in such assets, and for other purposes.”

The bill divides cryptocurrencies into three types: “crypto-commodity,” “crypto-currency,” and “crypto-security.” It proposes that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates the first type, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) the second type, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the third type.

Meanwhile, the SEC has proposed amending the definition of “accredited investor” to allow additional qualifications such as those based on professional knowledge, experience, or certifications. This will boost access to crypto investments since a number of them are currently only available to accredited investors. The Commission has also postponed its decision on the proposed rule change filed by NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the “United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust.” It has now designated Feb. 26 as the date by which it shall either approve or disapprove this proposed rule change.

As for crypto taxation, eight congressmen have sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) asking for clarification on how certain crypto transactions are taxed. The lawmakers pointed out a number of issues in the agency’s latest guidance, including unwarranted tax liabilities for crypto users who unwillingly receive forked or airdropped coins.

US State of Michigan Amends Law to Include Crypto

The Office of Governor Gretchen Whitmer of the U.S. state of Michigan announced on Friday that a number of House Bills and Senate Bills have been signed into law. Among them are House Bills 4102-4107 which “is a package of bills that amends various sections of the Michigan Penal Code to add direct and indirect reference to cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology,” the announcement describes.

House Bill 4102 prohibits the collection of any property or other valuables, including cryptocurrency, for the fighting baiting, or shooting of an animal. House Bill 4103 modifies the definition of “financial transaction device” to include the use of cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology.

House Bill 4104 modifies the definition of “racketeering” while House Bill 4105 specifies that “other personal property” would include cryptocurrency. House Bill 4106 makes altering a record made using distributed ledger technology a felony, and House Bill 4107 adds cryptocurrency to the definition of “monetary instrument.”

France’s First Approved ICO

The French financial markets regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), has approved the country’s first initial coin offering (ICO). The issuer is a company called French-ICO. French Law No. 2019-486 of 22 May 2019, also referred to as the Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation (Pacte) law, has introduced a regulatory framework for crypto assets and ICOs in France. The law gives issuers the option to obtain approval for their token sales from the AMF. “Although this approval is optional and ICOs without AMF approval will therefore continue to be legal, only those public offerings that have received the AMF approval may be marketed directly to the public in France,” the regulator explained.

Muslim Crypto

At the four-day Kuala Lumpur Summit, the leaders of a number of Muslim countries discussed creating a unified Muslim cryptocurrency. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani “proposed an Islamic financial payment with Muslim countries trading in local currencies and the creation of a Muslim cryptocurrency to cut reliance on the U.S. dollar and weather the effects of market fluctuation,” the Associated Press detailed. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad supported the idea. “It is the first time we hear Iran and also Turkey are of the opinion that if we do not have American dollars, we can use our own currency or one common currency that we (Muslim nations) can create if we agree,” he said.

China Questions Crypto Exchanges

Eight crypto companies have reportedly been placed under inquiry by the authorities in Shenzhen, China. Two of them were allegedly trading platform operators and six were associated with initial coin offerings. The authorities reportedly questioned representatives of the companies at a meeting hosted by the Financial Regulatory Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality on Dec. 18, with the participation of 10 other regulatory bodies. The regulators said they have conducted both online and offline investigations. A representative of the bureau clarified that the companies that have been questioned “have troubles,” but emphasized that it does not mean those that have not been questioned have no problem.

ECB’s Eurochain and ‘Anonymous’ CBDC

The European Central Bank (ECB) published a 10-page report entitled “Exploring anonymity in central bank digital currencies” on Dec. 17, showcasing its blockchain technology proof-of-concept. It explains how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could work. The concept, aimed to contribute to the broader discussion of central bank chains, deploys several features created by R3 and Accenture. The ECB calls the network “Eurochain.”

The report highlights the benefits of the hypothetical network and discusses how anonymity can fit into the logistics. It also describes how the ECB plans to enforce AML/CTF limits on the amount that a CBDC user can spend without the AML authority’s involvement.

Indian State to Produce 20,000 Blockchain Specialists

The Indian state of Kerala is planning to produce thousands of blockchain specialists. The state’s Information Technology Secretary Shri. M Sivasankar declared during the Blockhash Live 2019 conference: “The coming two years are crucial for us as we plan to produce 20,000 blockchain experts. The emphasis is on enhancing the quality of manpower steered by young startup companies.” He believes that blockchain technology is “a promising, new-age cutting edge technological innovation,” noting its potential to disrupt various business sectors including banking, insurance, trade finance, and retail. The event was organized by Kerala Blockchain Academy. It was attended by civil servants and industry representatives who spoke about positioning Kerala as the blockchain hub of India.

Poland Backdates Crypto Tax

The Polish tax administration has clarified that the Civil Law Transactions Tax (PCC) is applicable to crypto trades conducted before last year’s moratorium on its collection. The PCC is a 1% or 2% tax levied on sales of assets outside the scope of Europe’s value-added tax (VAT). The Polish Ministry of Finance imposed a temporary hold on its collection in the summer of 2018, which was extended in July this year until June 30, 2020.

The market surge took the cryptocurrency above $7,500 (£5,700) for the first time since the start of December, adding $7 billion to its overall market cap.

It remains a long way off the highs of around $13,000 over the summer - and the all-time record of close to $20,000 in 2017 - but is a significant improvement from the start of the year, when bitcoin was trading below $4,000.

The seasonal boost was predicted earlier this month, after research from digital currency exchange SFOX revealed that bitcoin has experienced positive market movements in the build-up to US holidays.

Similar price increases occurred in the run up to the Fourth of July holiday earlier this year, as well as Labour Day in September and Thanksgiving in November.

The research builds on previous studies that uncovered a correlation between bitcoin's price and Google searches relating to cryptocurrency.

""We posited that holidays could theoretically contribute to upswings in bitcoin's price because of families getting together, experiencing FOMO [fear of missing out], and subsequently researching and purchasing bitcoin,"" stated an SFOX blog post detailing the research.

""However, the most recent data we've analysed here show Google searches for 'bitcoin' peaking before holidays, not after. Regardless of which forces are really driving bitcoin's holiday behaviour, it seems as though bitcoin remains sensitive to major US holidays for the time being.""

Bitcoin has seen two significant price surges over the last week (CoinMarketCap)

Other cryptocurrencies also experienced positive price movements over the weekend, including ether (ethereum), XRP (ripple) and bitcoin cash. These altcoins are even more prone to huge price swings than the notoriously volatile bitcoin.

""Historically this has been a time when traders do look at altcoins and therefore volatility may increase,"" Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London-based cryptocurrency firm Luno, told The Independent.

Analysis of the latest price increase led some cryptocurrency analysts to predict further gains over the coming days.

One claimed current market movements suggest bitcoin could reach $8,000 by early next week, though last week similar forecasts predicted bitcoin would see new losses heading into 2020.","The organization behind ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, is drawing criticism from developers after scheduling an upgrade on New Year’s Day – a work holiday in most countries.

The Ethereum Foundation on Monday announced the plan to implement the “Muir Glacier” upgrade on Jan. 1. The upgrade will take place when the ethereum network hits its 9.2-millionth block, according to a blog post on the organization’s website.

The upgrade would come just less than a month after the network’s last upgrade in early December, known as “Istanbul.”

According to the blog post, node operators and cryptocurrency miners have to download the latest version of client software to comply with the new terms, rules and procedures stipulated under the upgrade.

The main purpose of the Muir Glacier upgrade is to delay a planned increase in the difficulty of mining new units of cryptocurrency by an estimated 611 days, according to a Dec. 16 post on the blog Ethereum Cat Herders, which is dedicated to community-led project management on the blockchain.

The delay comes amid concerns the so-called “difficulty bomb” would essentially increase the time needed to confirm new blocks of data on the network, resulting in a “degradation in the usability of ethereum due to waiting for confirmation for transactions.”

The upgrade was expected, but the move to schedule it for New Year’s Day sparked a negative reaction among some network users who had planned to take the day off along with colleagues.

Jorge Izquierdo, CEO of Aragon One, which allows groups of people to form organizations using the ethereum blockchain, tweeted he’s “trying hard not to be negative about ethereum lately.”

“Now someone from my team has to work on a day that they were free,” he wrote.

In a subsequent tweet, Izquierdo wrote that Aragon wouldn’t implement the upgrade on his platform’s infrastructure until Jan. 2.

According to Ethereum Cat Herders, the latest upgrade was needed “so soon after the last one” because prior estimates of the timing of the difficulty increase proved wrong.

“In order to avoid a delay with the Istanbul upgrade, it has been decided to address the difficulty bomb aka Muir Glacier upgrade as a separate one,” according to the post.

Ether, the main cryptocurrency for the ethereum network, was changing hands at $129 on Monday as of 5:26 p.m. universal coordinated time (12:25 p.m. in New York), down 0.7 percent over the prior 24 hours. That was the worst performance among digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion, according to the data provider Messari.","BestChange says it offers a solution to swap cryptocurrencies or buy them with fiat money, also by using Visa and MasterCard. The platform hosts several hundred exchangers whose prices are monitored in real time. In this way, users are able to choose the best offer and conduct exchange operations in a convenient manner.

How does the exchange platform work?

BestChange notes it pools a wide list of reliable crypto and e-currency exchange services in order to provide users with competitive quotes.

The platform aggregates the rates on a constant basis and displays them in a table. The table, which is located on the left side of the page, has two columns: Give and Get. Users can pick an option in the first column for the currency they want to sell and then select the digital currency they want to buy in the second column. When the choice is made, the user can see multiple exchange rates on the right side.

For example, one can choose the Visa/MasterCard USD option in the first column and Bitcoin in the second, thus creating a trading pair. If users pick this particular pair, they can see 14 exchangers offering different rates. The best exchange rate is listed on top.

BestChange is available here

While BestChange is performing due diligence before adding an exchanger to its platform, users can read client reviews for every available service. Besides client reviews, they can find other relevant data about exchangers, including their trading volume, the volume of a given currency, and the reserve of crypto and fiat currencies that they hold. If the service a user select doesn’t suit their needs, they can ask BestChange to send them Telegram or email notifications when the exchanger meets their expectations.

As of today, BestChange supports 12 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, Dash, Dogecoin, Zcash, Stellar, Tron and Tether (both Omni and ERC-20). Users can spend cryptocurrency or fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro and British pound, and select between multiple payment options, including credit cards, PayPal, wire transfers, Skrill, Neteller, WebMoney and more.

Security of the platform

Before adding a new service to the monitor, BestChange conducts in-depth analysis to make sure only trusted exchangers make the list. Services with low ratings or a dubious reputation are not included in the monitor. All exchangers’ sites offered on the exchange platform have high business levels.

The site has been around for 11 years: Initially, the platform was mostly used for swaps between different e-currencies from wallets like PayPal and Skrill. In the last few years, BestChange has focused on cryptocurrencies.

Besides being secure, the platform is transparent, the team emphasizes. There is a calculator that shows users the exact price they have to pay or that they will receive, adjusted for commissions.

2019-12-24,"As another year draws to a close in the world of Bitcoin and blockchain, we’ve decided to look back at some of our favorite cryptocurrency tweets of 2019.

Some are funny, others are weird, but we’ve loved each and every single one.

So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.

The Dorsey effect

First up, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, sent a Bitcoin Lightning Network invoice in a tweet in February — and people went nuts.

Dorsey has long beena supporter of Bitcoin and is often quite public about it.

He’s even shared his cryptocurrency plans with TNW.

Craig Wright won’t give up

What kind of roundup would this be if we didn’t at least allude to Craig Wright, the man who’s built a cryptocurrency patent empire and keeps claiming to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto?

It seems, he’s also intent on convincing everyone about how rich he is.

And if people don’t believe him, well, he just blames journalists.

But, let’s be honest, would you have it any other way?

Not impressed

The Winklevoss twins — aka Winklevii — who claim to own approximately 1-percent of all Bitcoin in circulation have worked hard this year.","Over the past few days, Bitcoin (BTC) has started to show signs of life, surging as high as $7,700 on the morning of Dec. 23. As of the time of writing this, the cryptocurrency is changing hands for $7,300, up nearly 15 percent from the brutal $6,400 low put in last week.

While bears argue that it is too soon to tell that the bottom of the downtrend is in, a key signal that last appeared after Bitcoin hit $3,150 in December of last year has just made an appearance again, providing investors with a strong bull case moving into 2020.

The bottom is in, key indicator says

If you’ve been on Crypto Twitter in the past few months, you’ve likely heard the term “miner capitulation” used time and time again.

For those unaware, miner capitulation is when certain miners of the Bitcoin network or other blockchains, often retail and non-industrial operations, are losing money by continuing to contribute computational power to collect cryptocurrencies. These miners are forced to sell their mined cryptocurrencies and/or shut off their operations, resulting in a large amount of bearish pressure in the Bitcoin market.

There is no exact way to determine when such capitulation takes place, though analysts say it coincides with stagnations or decreases in the Bitcoin network’s hash rate.

Charles Edwards, a digital asset manager, remarked that the most recent capitulation began on Nov. 19, with hash rate stalling and Bitcoin falling by 25 percent in the weeks that followed.

But according to his latest update, posted Dec. 23, miner capitulation has most likely ended, with Bitcoin’s hash rate finally breaking higher after weeks of flatlining, resulting in a signal of “recovery” being printed by his “Hash Ribbons” indicator. Edwards said:

“We have Hash Rate recovery! Historically this has signaled the end of Miner Capitulations.

In this case, it was a very shallow capitulation of average length (34 days). Buying on positive momentum from here has historically had wonderful R:R (likely at least a few days away)”

This is notable: the last time the Hash Ribbons printed a recovery signal was in January this year, which was when BTC was attempting to hold the low-$3,000s after the brutal plunge from $6,000 to $3,150. Also, a signal of recovery from the Hash Ribbons marked at least two other macro price bottoms in Bitcoin’s history.

As reported by CryptoSlate previously, a capitulation in the mining population and subsequent recovery is what preceded every previous bull run in Bitcoin’s history.

Simple chart analysis agrees

It isn’t only the Hash Ribbons that indicate the bottom is this macro move is in.

Prominent trader “SmokeyXBT” recently posted the chart below on Twitter, remarking that if $6,400 “was the generational Bitcoin bottom, it was the most perfect bottom to ever be formed.”

Indeed, the chart he attached to this message shows that BTC bounced off a macro established support of the 2018 bear market, which coincided with the lower bound of a six-month-long descending channel.

Can bulls push Bitcoin higher from here?

The question then remains: can bulls push Bitcoin higher from the $7,000s to the $8,000s and beyond?

According to a number of prominent traders, for sure.

“Dave the Wave,” a prominent chartist that called the recent drop to the $6,000s when Bitcoin was trading above $10,000, recently noted that he believes the one-week Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) — an indicator tracking trends of assets — is likely going to see a bullish crossover early next year. The popular trader wrote:

“Weekly MACD shaping up to re-cross bullishly soon to confirm the continuation of the next cycle.”

Bullish MACD readings on Bitcoin’s one-week chart marked the start of previous bull runs, including the miniaturized one seen from March of this year to July.

Fundamental developments seemingly favor bulls as well. As put best by Andy Bromberg of Coinlist in a recent Bloomberg interview:

“We are seeing a level of building that has happened in 2019 [which makes it feel like] we’re in the moment of everyone is putting on their jumpsuits, ready to take off.”

“Cancer affects people from all walks of life, so it’s not surprising that we draw support from a broad cross-section of donors,” ACS exec Brant Woodward told CoinDesk. “Our mission is urgent and in order to accomplish it, we need to engage donors where they are.”

Founded in 2011 as a bitcoin payment solution, BitPay said it has handled more than $50 million in donations since 2017 with partners such as the Tony Hawk Foundation and the American Red Cross.

Over the same period, the average crypto donation has hovered around $10,000, according to BitPay statistics. BitPay processes donations at a 1 percent flat-rate fee, which can be picked up by donors as well if they wish.

Working similarly to stock donations, crypto donations are acknowledged for tax purposes, as heralded during this year’s rendition of Giving Tuesday.

“In accepting bitcoin donations, charitable organizations attract new donors without ever having to hold bitcoin,” BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said. “BitPay verifies the funds and accepts the bitcoin on behalf of the organization and settles the transaction in USD or the preferred fiat.”

The ACS relies mostly on grassroots fundraising, particularly among people in their forties and fifties, Woodward told CoinDesk. As crypto is a nascent financial technology, the ACS hopes working with BitPay will bring younger donors into the fold.","Only 10 years ago, no one knew what a blockchain was. Today, there are hundreds of well-established and emerging cryptocurrencies using blockchain technology to supplant traditional fiat money and change the way we live.

Litecoin (LTC) has drawn a lot of investor interest after hitting the headlines in December 2017. Then, the cryptocurrency reached its record high of $375, an 8,200 per cent increase year-on-year, hitting a total LTC market cap of $19.5 billion.

However, following the latest crypto market news where prices have fallen across the board, many now wonder: will Litecoin go up once again? Can it fully recover and set some new records after the bumpy ride of the second half of 2019?

While this year is about to come to an end, closing the first decade of crypto’s existence, analysts are split in their Litecoin price predictions. Some experts say that its current all-time high could be just a drop in the bucket and predict the coin to hit an overwhelming $595 by 2030. Others take a bearish stance, believing that another crypto winter is yet to come, with Litecoin future price dropping as low as $1.5 by the end of 2024.

So, if you are wondering, “should I invest in Litecoin or not?” we have you covered. In this article, we try to find the truth by taking a closer look at what factors influence this cryptocurrency, reviewing its recent performance, analysing the latest developments and checking out the Litecoin price prediction for 2020 and beyond.

The very basics: what is Litecoin?

Before we delve deep into the Litecoin price predictions, let’s do a quick review on what LTC is.

On October 7, 2011, Litecoin (LTC) was created by Charlie Lee, an ex-Google employee and former Engineering Director at Coinbase. Designed as a peer-to-peer network with the same-name native cryptocurrency, it was launched to complement Bitcoin by solving issues like concentrated mining pools and transaction timings, as well as to make the crypto world more accessible.

Truth be told, these two do share a lot in common. However, there are still some substantial advantages that Litecoin boasts of. These include, among others, improved capacity, faster block generation and higher supply limits.

On the other hand, as Litecoin’s purpose initially was to be “silver” to Bitcoin “gold”, some sceptics call into question whether it will ever be able to become anything more than its main rival. While Litecoin technically has a superior algorithm, it may be rather irrelevant since Bitcoin’s popularity has cemented it as the gold standard for old and new crypto traders. Moreover, the next-gen altcoins are emerging almost daily, taking the industry's competition to a whole other level.

Litecoin price analysis: the rise and fall of the alt-legend

After its launch, Litecoin was fast to get the attention of the small yet growing crypto community of the time. Nonetheless, its value had remained rather low – around $3 – for quite a long time. It was only in November 2013 when the market finally saw the first significant price movements. On November 28, LTC value almost doubled within one day and reached the price of $50 per coin.

However, such a substantial jump was short-lived. In April 2014, Litecoin dropped to $10 and further to a little over $1 in February 2015. The crypto was then traded in the range of $1-$4 for the next two years.

In March 2017, Litecoin announced the launch date of their Segregated Witness (SegWit) protocol upgrade. The statement had a positive impact on the coin’s rate, with its value rising to $16. In May, the protocol changes were finally implemented, making LTC the first of the top five cryptocurrencies to adopt SegWit and pushing its price to $30.

Meanwhile, the dev team implemented the Lightning Network, attracting a lot of attention from the crypto enthusiasts. By September, LTC reached $70. With the whole market being bullish, sending Bitcoin and altcoins to set new price records, Litecoin hit its all-time high of $375 in mid-December.

For the most part of 2018, Litecoin was in a bearish trend. Despite its well-established position in the industry, the coin was affected by the overall descending dynamic of the market. The downward Litecoin trend only changed a couple of times: in February and April. All-in-all, the coin’s price decreased almost five times over the course of the year.

At the end of 2018, things started getting better, and Litecoin managed to stabilise, finally gaining an upside momentum.

At the beginning of 2019, Litecoin continued its price growth. During the first half of the year, LTC price increased four times from $31.02 to $138.4. The reason for such a significant price hike was the upcoming Litecoin halving, which happened on August 5.

However, the event was followed by the much-expected correction, with the price of Litecoin dropping as low as $68 by mid-September. Throughout the rest of the year, the coin remained in the downward trend. At the time of writing, on December 20, LTC traded at $40.

What can determine Litecoin future price: does LTC stand a chance?

Back in the days, Litecoin was at the forefront of modern and relevant technologies. Its early implementation of SegWit protocol and Atomic swaps has revolutionised the sphere of the cryptocurrency payments.

However, Litecoin has been recently struggling with many difficulties. Now that Bitcoin also introduced SegWit, the altcoin lacks one of its crucial competitive advantages.

Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, said: “Litecoin's price action has historically followed Bitcoin's, but currently it is facing negativity on multiple fronts. In the absence of new capital flow, transaction volumes have remained tame and the August halving has failed to push the price higher.”

He also added: “In fact, miners have begun to abandon the network after the reward-reduction, which is why the hashrate is falling and concerns are being raised about the network's security.”

Marouane Garcon, managing director of crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform Amulet, also weighed in, saying that Litecoin's recent price decline “has more to do with the concerns about development and how they are going to be funded going forward.”

Earlier this year, Charlie Lee reportedly told Franklyn Richards, director of Litecoin Foundation, that “no one is interested in working on Litecoin protocol development work.” After this information was disclosed, “people’s perspective of Litecoin changed,” continued Garcon. “Litecoin has not been the same since that announcement,” he added.

“It threw everyone into a panic. If no one is willing to work on Litecoin and develop it then why should anyone invest in it?”

Based on the latest study conducted by Sylvain Saurel, the potential of Litecoin is very limited. He explained that the coin peaked in 2017 as it was riding on Bitcoin’s wave of success, taking advantage of the increasing number of interested investors. Although Litecoin remains in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, this number is still too far from its record high of $19 billion.

Saurel claims: “Litecoin will certainly remain in the top 10 of cryptocurrencies for some time to come, but its future is clearly not alongside Bitcoin that could revolutionise the monetary and financial system in the future.”

Litecoin has reported a decrease in its hashrate since mid-2019, reaching its lowest levels since 2018.

At the time of writing, its hashrate was 147.4 TH/s. If the fall is prolonged, it could negatively affect the future performance of Litecoin.

However, it is important to note that the network is now working on some major changes. According to the latest news, the Litecoin Foundation is currently cooperating with Steve Burkett, a developer of the Grin project, to implement MimbleWible in the Litecoin protocol. Once realised, Litecoin could move away from Bitcoin, creating a unique selling point. On the other hand, innovation will reduce fungibility, possibly making Litecoin susceptible to being blocked from important exchanges.

All in all, Litecoin has a great advantage to make improvements to itself much faster than Bitcoin does. However, with the rapid development of new crypto projects that have base codes that are already more fit for micro-transactions and scaling, has Litecoin missed its chance to stay on top?

Litecoin price prediction 2020 and beyond: what to expect in the following decade

It is no secret that the crypto market moves at a rapid pace, making it rather difficult to predict its future. We have made our own investigation to compile a list of the latest Litecoin forecasts from various sources.

Based on technical analysis, TradingBeasts.com, a popular crypto forecast website, predicted that by the end of next year, LTC price will be around $46.23; and only a bit higher in 2021 – up to $67.23. By December 2022, Litecoin is expected to grow to an average of $82.68.

A more optimistic LTC price forecast is provided by Cryptoground.com. Based on an internal deep learning algorithm, it states that LTC will reach $88.30 in one year, rising almost 109.81 per cent. It is expected that the growth will continue, with the coin trading at $347.8 by the end of 2024.

According to the information provided by CoinFan.com, another famous online forecasting service, Litecoin future predictions look rather promising, with LTC prognosed to end 2020 at $276.4. Their long-term forecast suggests the coin will hit $506.8 by May 2025.

George Tung, a cryptocurrency analyst, has the most positive Litecoin projections, saying its price might rise as high as $1,500 towards the end of 2020.

Looking forward, DigitalCoinPrice.com states that Litecoin will have moderate price growth. The positive trend is expected to prevail, with the coin trading at $72 in December 2026.

Regarding the Litecoin price prediction 2030, the coin is expected to end the following decade at $251.44, according to CoinPriceForecast.com.

However, not everyone has taken a bullish stance. Walletinvestor.com, known for their pragmatic forecasts, refers to LTC as a “bad, high-risk one-year investment option.” According to their Litecoin predictions, the coin is expected to lose in value significantly, with its price falling to $4.5 by August 2020. However, it is expected to recover by fall and end next year at $36.8.

In five years, Wallet Investor estimates the coin to drop as low as $0.77 by the end of 2024.

The bottom line: is it worth investing in Litecoin?

The crypto market has experienced several ups and downs over this year. While all the talks revolve around digital money, there are still many questions to answer.

Will Litecoin rise and live up to the expectations of analysts? As you can understand, there is no definite answer to this question. It is very difficult to predict what the price of Litecoin could be in a few hours; and even harder to give long-term estimates. However, according to the forecasts mentioned above, LTC is mainly prognosed to move in a positive direction.

Is Litecoin a good investment for the long term? Well, many crypto enthusiasts believe that the project has the technological strengths that could help it to become even more popular in the crypto world.

When choosing what cryptocurrency to invest in, it is always crucial to consider the latest technical analysis, expert opinion and market trends. For that, we recommend you do as much research as possible.

If you think you are not ready to make long-term investment commitments, but still want to try to profit from the market volatility, you can do so through contracts for difference (CFD).

Per the announcement, the Rakuten Super Points can be converted into three digital currencies – Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash. The loyalty points holders, however, should have an account on Rakuten Wallet.

The company stated that the users need to have a minimum of 100 Rakuten Super Points to exchange it for cryptocurrencies. Moreover, one Rakuten Super Point is equivalent to one yen when converted to crypto assets, the financial giant detailed.

“Through the launch of the new service, Rakuten Wallet hopes to reduce the barriers of entry to crypto asset trading by providing an easy and more accessible way for new users to start, including novice users who are interested in crypto asset trading with no prior experience,” the announcement noted.

“The service also increases the range of uses for Rakuten Super Points across the Rakuten Group’s ecosystem of services, making the Rakuten loyalty membership program even more attractive and convenient.”

The Japanese company also capped the maximum transaction limit of the points for single transactions, along with a maximum monthly cap of 500,000 points.

Bringing crypto to the mainstream audience

Rakuten Wallet is the digital currency wallet and trading platform of the Japanese conglomerate and was launched in August. The platform supports trading with three digital assets and is one of the few such regulated platforms in Japan.

The company also detailed that initially, the loyalty points exchange service will only available on Android devices, but it has plans to bring support on iOS devices as well by next month.

Earlier this year, Monex-owned Coincheck launched similar loyalty points exchange services for Macromill Points against multiple digital assets – Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP.","Since the start of 2019, the crypto market has been on the receiving end of an insane amount of financial volatility.

For example, in January, the total market capitalization of this burgeoning sector was around $130 billion. However, by July, the market at large had witnessed an influx of bullish momentum that pushed the total capitalization value of this space to a whopping $373 billion. Following this period, the aforementioned bull run proceeded to subside quite a bit, with the market now hovering a tad under the $200 billion threshold.

A few cryptocurrencies maintained a strong financial standing all year long and were able to stave off the various economic slumps that were observed throughout 2019. Here are the standout cryptos not named Bitcoin.

ChainLink

While a fair few people may be surprised to see ChainLink (LINK) in the list of the best-performing cryptocurrencies of 2019. The platform essentially seeks to bridge the gap that exists between blockchain-based smart contracts and real-world applications.

From an economic standpoint, LINK started the year relatively slow — with the price of a single token rising from $0.31 to just over $0.45 over a five-month period. However, by the first week of July, the currency reached its financial apex, with a single LINK token being traded for as high as $3.74. And while the currency has lost a bit of its insane financial momentum over the last couple of months, LINK is still trading slightly above the $1.90 mark.

All in all, the LINK/USD trading pair has surged by over 500% since the start of the year, and the LINK/BTC pair has also gained more than 300% over the same time period — which is quite an impressive feat, to say the least.

Binance Coin

Released onto the market back in mid-2017, Binance Coin (BNB) is a token that can be used for trading purposes as well as for the facilitation of various fee-related payments within the Binance exchange platform. Not only that, but Binance also provides BNB holders with various incentives and discounts for making use of the digital currency for internal transactions.

In regard to BNB’s performance, the currency started the year at a price point of around $6. However, by the final week of May, the price of a single BNB token rose to $35.20 — thereby signaling a growth of more than 450%. During the third quarter of 2019, BNB’s value slid from $33.10 to $15.79, thus showcasing a drastic reversal in the currency’s fortunes. However, over the last couple of months, BNB’s value has remained relatively stable, with the asset’s average value in December currently floating just below the $14 mark.

Since the start of the year, the overall value of the BNB/USD pair has increased by over 140%.

Tezos

Tezos (XTZ) is a decentralized computing platform that makes use of a formal verification protocol as well as a proof-of-stake consensus module for its internal governance-related matters. In regard to how the system works, XTZ holders who stake their tokens are eligible to receive additional tokens as an incentive for creating and verifying blocks.

From a financial performance standpoint, XTZ started off the year at a price point of $0.47. However, by the end of the first quarter of 2019, the value of a single token had scaled up to an impressive $1.06. XTZ’s performance continued to surge between April and June, with the currency touching its annual high of $1.88 on May 19. During this year’s third quarter, XTZ’s value continued to hover around the $1–$1.20 region. However, since the start of December, the crypto asset has once again picked up momentum, with a single token currently trading for $1.51.

Over the course of 2019, the value of the XTZ/USD trading pair has increased by over 190%.

Synthetix Network Token

The Synthetix Network Token (SNX) is an ERC-20 token that is meant to facilitate all of the native transactions associated with the Synthetix exchange. Additionally, SNX tokens are traded using a peer-to-contract model and are also used as collateral to back SNX synthetic assets, called Synths, that are employed within the Synthetix Network to track the market value of any basic asset.

Between January and April, the price of a single SNX token touched a maximum of $0.07. However, since May, the digital currency has continued to soar in value — with the only major slip coming on Nov. 26, a time when the crypto market at large experienced a major financial pullback.

Overall, since the start of 2019, SNX’s value has increased by over 200%, with the currency currently trading for $1.33.

Bitcoin Cash

Currently one of the market’s top 10 cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is basically a hard fork of Bitcoin.

From a financial perspective, one BCH was trading for $135 during the second week of January. However, by the beginning of April, the currency had soared to over the $300 threshold. The currency reached its annual monetary apex on June 26, when the asset was trading for $479.96. During the third quarter of 2019, BCH’s value remained relatively stable — hovering around the $300 mark — but since the start of November, the currency has been continually slipping in value, with a single coin currently trading just over $195.

All in all, over the course of the last 12 months, the value of the BCH/USD trading pair has risen by over 30%.

Cosmos

Cosmos (ATOM) is a decentralized network comprising of various blockchains that are independent, scalable and interoperable. The platform has gained a lot of attention over the course of 2019, especially since cryptocurrency associated with the network, ATOM, surged dramatically during the month of May. To put things into perspective, it bears mentioning that on Jan. 1, ATOM was trading for a price of $0.001.

As things stand, the currency is selling well over $4.20.

Litecoin

Litecoin (LTC) is a top 10 cryptocurrency that was created by Charlie Lee to serve as a more resource-friendly version of Bitcoin.

LTC was trading for $32 during the first week of January. But by June 22, the altcoin had risen to an impressive price point of $141.73. Since then, LTC’s performance has continued to decline, with the currency trading for an average price of around $43 throughout December.

All in all, the value of the LTC/USD trading pair has increased by around 40% since the start of the year.

Basic Attention Token

Basic Attention Token (BAT) is a digital currency used in the Brave internet browser. Brave is a blockchain-based internet browser that incentivizes its users’ internet habits by rewarding them with BAT tokens for watching ads, spending a certain amount of time on a particular website, etc. From a technical standpoint, the browser’s native framework is quite similar to that of Chromium — a project that was created by Brendan Eich, the man behind JavaScript and the co-founder of the Mozilla project.

BAT started off the year trading at around $0.13. However, by the second half of April, the currency had already scaled up to its annual high of $0.44. Following this period, the top 50 asset continued to slide in value until September, after which it once again began a financial ascent, reaching a relative high of $0.27 on Nov 17. Since the start of December, BAT’s value has remained relatively stable around the $1.70 region.

Over the course of 2019, BAT’s value has increased by around 35%.

Ether

Ether (ETH) is a top 10 crypto asset that is widely recognized as being the second most popular digital asset (i.e., after Bitcoin) on the market today. Ethereum developers envisioned the platform as a “world computer” for smart contracts — a digital protocol that helps facilitate, verify and enforce a contract whose terms have been predetermined. Not only that, but the Ethereum ecosystem also allows for the issuance of ERC-20 tokens.

On Jan. 13, Ether was trading for $116. However, over the course of the following six months, the value of the second-biggest cryptocurrency continued to increase, finally scaling up to its annual high of $334.66 on June 26. Following this period of bullish momentum, Ether once again continued to slide before finally settling down around a price range of $150–$180, except for a brief period in September when the currency surged above the $210 mark.

Since late November, Ether has been trading steadily between $130 and $150, thereby showcasing an overall value increase of around 20% since the start of the year.

EOS

EOS is a cryptocurrency platform that can be used by developers to devise a number of novel decentralized applications. In this regard, the EOS token is used to facilitate the eponymous system’s native transactions as well as its internal processes. Additionally, the EOS blockchain has been designed to be highly scalable and leaves a lot of room for customization — which is one of the main reasons why the project is so popular in the first place.

In terms of EOS’s financial performance, the digital currency was trading for $2.23 during the second week of January. Between the months of February and May, the asset surged quite dramatically, with the value of a single token reaching a price point of $8.54 on May 31. Over roughly the next five months, the currency’s value continued to float between $3–$3.80. However, since the last week of November, EOS has remained quite stable, currently trading around the $2.55 mark.

Presently, the EOS/USD trading pair has gained around a 10% value since the start of the year.","Two useful trading techniques that have become popular in the cryptocurrency space recently are staking and lending.

Today, my goal is to discuss the difference between staking and lending and how you can use these techniques to adapt your trading strategy depending on your risk/reward profile.

Essentially, while staking helps to secure the network and in turn pays users with newly minted coins, lending allows users to lock up their coins and receive an interest payment.

I cannot say one strategy is better than the other, as it depends on what type of investor you are.

If you like to directly participate in a protocol, perhaps staking is more your thing, while if you’re simply looking to get an interest payment, lending could be the right choice for you.

Similarly, if you consider giving up control of your coins too risky no matter what, then you may think neither strategy is worthwhile. It’s completely up to you, and you should always do your own research and make sure you’re comfortable with your level of risk/reward when trading.

As always, the views in this article should not be considered financial advisement.

Staking coins

Although there’s a bunch of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols available – like Ardor, Dash, or EOS – I will instead focus on which exchanges, preferably non-custodial, allow users to stake coins directly.

The first I’ll discuss is IDEX.

IDEX, as the name indicates, is a decentralised exchange where users own their private-public key pairs. To trade, users sign transactions using interfaces such as MetaMask.

IDEX also incorporates the AURA token – the exchange’s native currency – which encourages users to stake the coin and help support the network. The AURA token enables stakers to earn a share of fees generated by IDEX and other Aurora products.

By staking AURA, node operators will be rewarded proportionately to their percentage stake, and 50% of fees have been allocated to be paid to AURA stakers. Traders will also be able to utilise the Boreal coin as a payment option for trading fees or as a stable base currency.

The second exchange worth mentioning is Switchain.

Switchain is an instant non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange with a user-friendly platform that makes trading crypto easy and fast.

Switchain works with different cryptocurrency trading partners to guarantee the best cryptocurrency rates for its clients.

An important partner I would like to mention is Exodus, one of the most widely used crypto wallets. By integrating Switchain’s fixed rate API, users of Exodus wallets have been able to exchange crypto assets with a single click.

Switchain works in a non-custodial manner, and the wallet creates an exchange on behalf of the user. The user sends the coins and receives the exchanged asset instantly.

Lending coins

If you hold different crypto-assets, then you can make them work for you in a high-interest account. Companies like BlockFi and Celsius Network provide a simple way to earn up to 10% interest on your crypto-assets per annum.

You have to read the fine print and do your own research as there are many different companies around offering to pay interest on different cryptocurrencies. Be sure you know the lock-up period (if any) and what rates you get on each coin.

Celsius won’t pay you 10% interest on your BTC, for example. But they will give you somewhere between 4-5% depending on how much you hold with them. If you want to earn the big interest rates, you could consider purchasing a stablecoin like TRUEUSD or Gemini Dollar with your fiat and holding there rather than with a bank.

At the end of the day, with all these solutions, you have to give up custody of your coins. If that’s not a problem for you, earning some additional benefits on your crypto makes a lot of sense. If you’re a firm believer that you should retain your private keys at all times, you may be better off simply HODLing after all.","Analysts are certain: investing in BTC mining today shows the most promise. The outcome is guaranteed by the underlying technology not a third party of some kind.

Nowadays lots of crypto analysts are looking forward to the halving event, wondering what it means and how the crypto community will respond to the changes. Mr. Ilya Goldberg, executive partner at ECOS believes: the halving event holds a much more positive change for the crypto environment than you may have initially thought.

So what exactly is a halving event? In layman’s terms, it is when the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is cut in half, and it occurs every 210,000 blocks. If we look at history, the original reward amount was set at 50 BTC, but then was cut down to 25 coins, then 12.5 coins — and that’s where it has stayed since. It is planned to be reduced further to 6.25 BTC in May 2020. The operational efficiency of Bitcoin will then increase, its network fees will get cheaper, which in turn will bump up the demand, bringing Bitcoin closer to wider adoption — on a global scale.

The consequences? Lots of mining ASICs will instantly become obsolete and shut down. Running obsolete hardware is simply not profitable.

Obsolete equipment is one that generates so little profit it can’t even cover the power expenses. Bitmain‘s Antminer S9 will become exactly that, and lest we forget, this particular ASIC model constitutes roughly 80% of the mining hardware currently servicing cryptocurrency networks.

What’s going to happen next? Once 80% of mining hardware goes offline for lack of commercial viability, competition among miners will drastically decrease, while new ASIC models will gain tremendously in terms of efficiency (30TH and up, with higher power efficiency). This, in turn, will cause an uptick in price on new ASIC models.

“Here at Ecos we have analyzed the feasibility of new hardware and its projected profitability after the block reward is halved. The conclusion is the following: now is the most opportune time to invest into such ASICs as Bitmain Antminer T17, or other models rated at 38 — 40TH or higher that are perfectly capable of generating enough profit to both cover the power bill and generate a significant profit”, says Ilya Goldberg.

“We have charted the ROI for these miners for various BTC price projections and baseline equipment cost. We learned that the higher the equipment costs, the longer the payback period. We have also factored in the possibility of a situation similar to 2017, when a cascading increase in demand for new generation miners caused scarcity on the market and drove the prices even higher”, added he.

Currently, the T17 model is priced at 1299 U.S. dollars. Further down the line, this figure may surge to 3000 US dollars or higher, as with the S9 model at the height of the mining craze in 2017.

In the past every halving event caused Bitcoin price to grow afterward. Experts agree that the same can be expected in 2020. Let’s add to this the projected drop in difficulty by more than 50% after S9 miners go offline, and we arrive at the conclusion that mining with innovative hardware will remain profitable even if Bitcoin price doesn’t rise (which is unlikely).

The current difficulty is 1.28768E+13 (at the time of writing). Post-halving difficulty will drop to 5.15074E+12 (60% less). Mining is expected to yield 0.00002441 BTC per 1 TH/24h. With different BTC prices we may expect the following figures:

Having calculated all the possible scenarios, ECOS has decided to launch its new service: a quick and easy access to high-performance ASIC miners (Antminer T17, Antminer S17) online, directly from the ECOS warehouse: forget about having to wait for shipping or customs clearance, pay for the ASIC and have the device installed and prepared for running at the ECOS co-hosting facility where it will begin mining Bitcoin straight to your private account the very next day. The ECOS data center is located in Armenia, in the Free Economic Zone established by the Armenian Government, which makes it a reliable, legal and secure location for a business like this.

To learn more about the opportunity, visit the official ECOS website.

Analysts are certain: investing in BTC mining today shows the most promise. The outcome is guaranteed by the underlying technology not a third party of some kind. The key is to jump into the market at the right moment — while the indicators are at their lowest possible levels.

Do you see the opportunity?","Paraguay is preparing to take its nascent cryptocurrency industry mainstream.

Last week, the Latin American country’s anti-money-laundering (AML) chief, the Secretary for Preventing Money and Property Laundering (SEPRELAD), announced a nationwide crypto survey. All of Paraguay’s virtual asset service providers (VASPs) were directed to open their books to the government for the first time. The self-reported information was due Dec. 20.

Impelled by the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) June guidance on VASPs, the mass audit will help Paraguay’s government understand its domestic crypto industry, SEPRELAD officials told CoinDesk. Also, it will pave the way for the country’s first crypto-specific regulations, set to roll out in the first half of 2020.

“Data obtained will be used to measure the degree of adoption, complexity and size of the virtual asset market in Paraguay, with the purpose of drafting a regulation that adequately regulates them and mitigates the risk of misuse,” Secretary Minister Christian Villanueva said.

Never before has this landlocked nation of 6.8 million regulated cryptocurrencies, although its central bank warned the public last June that only the guaraní currency is considered to be legal tender.

Paraguay has instead largely avoided the issue. In a country dominated by off-the-books business dealings – the International Monetary Fund estimated that informal employment represents “more than half” of Paraguay’s total jobs – bitcoin regulation was a financial afterthought.

But FATF’s June 2019 regulatory guidelines increased pressure for Paraguay to develop crypto standards, according to Villanueva. Recommendation 15 of the FATF guideline expanded AML benchmarks to include technologies such as “virtual assets”

Now, with its new directive, SEPRELAD puts Paraguay on track for compliance with Recommendation 15 before 2020 is out. Crypto miners, over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, exchanges and other VASPs will have to register with the government and implement baseline oversight on their customers’ doings, with counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) protocols and AML safeguards, SEPRELAD said.

Financial inclusion

SEPRELAD’s audit puts VASPs on track for eventual inclusion in Paraguay’s formal financial landscape, according to business analyst and Paraguayan bitcoiner Stan Canova.

Before the government took a stand on crypto, Canova said, Paraguay’s banking sector shut out the miners and traders that did. The government had the “perfect excuse” to deny business-facing bitcoiners baseline financial tools, such as bank accounts.

“The banks said [to VASPs], ‘Hey, you’re not being controlled by SEPRELAD. You’re not under the umbrella of the law. So you’re a risk,’” Canova said.

VASPs, therefore, store piles of cash in private vaults, according to Jorge Ramírez, founder and CEO of the OTC service Cripex.

Ramírez and Canova both claim industry members already engage in self-governance, even though they are not required to do so under the law.

“We here in Paraguay, we auto-regulate ourselves. And we institute the same level of compliance that the banks have with their customers in regards to KYC and AML, even though the banks don’t want to work with us,” Ramírez said.

Acceptance and resistance

Paraguay’s AML enforcer recently brokered a regulatory détente with the country’s crypto businesses.

In September, Congressman Sebastían Garciá, an active voice in Paraguay’s crypto space, held a conference attended by SEPRELAD and the industry, seeking to find common ground.

SEPRELAD then determined the sector is “predisposed” to working with it on FATF compliance, Secretary Villanueva said.

But not everyone in the community welcomes government oversight, according to Canova, who lobbied on miners’ and traders’ behalf at the September meeting.

“There was another group in the hearing and they were totally angry about SEPRELAD oversight,” Canova said. “Some people don’t want anything to do with anti-money-laundering or due diligence with their clients.”

Canova predicted that certain businesses and groups will hold out, even if it’s to their detriment.

“This thing is going to be polarizing,” Canova said."
2019-12-25,"YouTube, one of the most popular social media platforms for video sharing, has aggressively started deleting cryptocurrency-related content from some of the biggest influencers in the industry.

Based on Twitter and Reddit threads, YouTube suddenly began deleting a number of cryptocurrency videos on Dec. 23.

YouTuber Chris Dunn, whose channel has over 210,000 subscribers, noticed on Monday that the platform had removed all of his videos that mentioned cryptocurrencies.

Following this, Dunn tweeted, ""@YouTube just removed most of my crypto videos citing 'harmful or dangerous content' and 'sale of regulated goods'... it's been 10 years of making videos, 200k+ subs, and 7M+ views. WTF are you guys doing @TeamYouTube?!""

YouTube: The Grinch Who Stole Cryptomas

Dunn hasn’t been the only YouTuber affected by the platform’s sudden ban. On Dec. 24 — Christmas Eve — Robert Beadles, host of YouTube channel Crypto Beadles with over 89.3 thousand subscribers, tweeted that YouTube had shut him down temporarily.

“Hey peeps! @YouTube @YTCreators has shut us down for a while. Guess free content and never taking a penny for any content is bad? We’ll post on my Linkedin, Twitter, Instagram going forward all accounts are under Robert Beadles there. God Bless #censorship #youtube #bitcoin”

While it appears that the Crypto Beadles YouTube page is up and running again, some influencers haven’t been as lucky.

YouTuber Ivan on Tech, whose channel has more than 210,000 subscribers, has also been affected by the ban. His account received one strike and he has set all of his videos to private ""as a precaution."" He told Cointelegraph:

“This is an attack not only on crypto, but on the entire notion of free speech. Centralized platforms have become way too big and powerful for their own good and their deplatforming is the reason decentralized platforms will conquer.”

A Tweet sent out on Dec. 24 by Omar Bham (@crypt0snews) shows an updated list of all the YouTubers who have recently had their crypto-related content banned from the platform.

Why Is YouTube Deleting Crypto Content?

YouTube has not yet released a public statement on why they are banning crypto-related content. The video giant, a Google subsidiary, did not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. This story will be updated if YouTube responds.

The lack of communication from YouTube has left influencers to speculate on the reason for the sudden crackdown.

Shortly after sharing the updated list of accounts that have been affected by YouTube’s ban, Bham tweeted that it seems YouTube is deleting crypto channels with links to external websites or exchanges listed in video descriptions.

“It seems that a reason why YouTube would have to go after crypto channels is any links to external websites/exchanges in video descriptions.”

Although this is an assumption, Bham may be onto something.

For instance, YouTuber Rachel Siegel manages Crypto Finally, a YouTube channel with 2.54 subscribers. Siegel told Cointelegraph that she has not been affected by YouTube’s ban on cryptocurrency-related content:

“I have not personally been affected by the apparent ban on cryptocurrency videos on YouTube, however, I think it is clear that this is some sort of targeted attack. Tech censorship has been getting a lot of public spotlight lately, and as we continue to grow as an industry I can expect we will continue to see more mass bans and crypto content takedowns.”

Siegel confirmed that she does not link to external websites or exchanges in any of her videos.

“I once referenced Coinbase, but took that down,” said Siegel.

Interestingly enough, while some YouTube channels have not yet been censored by the platform, reports continue to flood Twitter on channels that have been impacted.

@TheMoonCarl recently tweeted, “The YouTube purge has now reached my channel! One video from 27th of January 2019 ""broke the rules"" because it was ""Harmful and dangerous content"". Sure, #Bitcoin is harmful and dangerous for the banks, but this is just ridiculous.”

Before sending this tweet, Carl told Cointelegraph:

“I hope this is a mistake by YouTube, because if not, then this is censorship in its purest form. Big YouTubers have seen their videos deleted. These videos did nothing more than educate people about the power of Bitcoin. It’s only a matter of time until my channel is attacked.”

While crypto influencers are still unsure as to why YouTube is banning crypto-related content, the Twitter account @TeamYouTube replied to Bham’s tweet that showed an updated list of crypto influencer that have been banned from the platform.

The below tweet, which was posted 18 hours ago at press time, said that YouTube will be looking into the matter, with an update to come soon.

No further updates have yet been released from @TeamYouTube on Twitter.

Regarding the matter, Bham told Cointelegraph, “That thread with Team YouTube was the extent of any direct responses that I've heard of. Team YouTube last updated us by linking to the regular YT community guidelines, and a reminder that we can appeal videos with a strike. Several YouTubers appealed, and had their appeals rejected, with no clear reason again as to why the video directly violated guidelines.”

Will An Alternative Emerge?

Although YouTube is ranked as the second most popular social media platform, with over 1.9 billion users, crypto influencers are looking for other platforms to share their content. In particular, blockchain-based social media platforms are proving to be appealing to the crypto community.

For example, LBRY is a sharing platform that uses blockchain technology to allow users to publish content and get paid. LBRY helps its users monetize their published material with its built-in payment system.

Monetization is also a critical aspect for many YouTubers. Recent statistics show that a number of YouTube channels generate six figures each year, an amount that is increasing by 40 percent every year.

According to Bham, who has been uploading crypto-related content to his YouTube page since 2016, a channel hit with a strike such as this may be unable to livestream for up to 90 days, heavily impacting a user’s income.

“As far as income, even with a successful appeal, a channel hit with a strike may be unable to livestream for up to 90 days,” Bham told Cointelegraph. “This has happened to me, and plummeted my income, since I relied heavily on real time engagement for my shows.”

However, while LBRY offers a monetization system and a YouTube platform that lets YouTubers republish their content to the LBRY network, the platform is still not being utilized by many YouTubers just yet.

Naomi Brockwell, Host of YouTube channel NBTV, which has more than 30,000 subscribers,, told Cointelegraph that while she was not affected by the YouTube ban, she believes it is time to start looking at decentralized platforms like LBRY:

“I haven't been affected by the youTube ban yet, but I would just add that we've had alternative decentralized platforms like LBRY for a long time with limited support from youtubers. Hopefully this is a wakeup call.”

However, some YouTubers who use decentralized platforms like LBRY have pointed out that their audience is limited on these channels, as most already have an understanding about cryptocurrency and blockchain.

“In addition to YouTube, many creators including myself are using decentralized content platforms such DTube, Steemit, Minds, LBRY, Bitchute & Bittube, explained Siegel of Crypto Finally. “While these platforms do solve the issue of censorship and takedowns of our content, it unfortunately still does limit our audiences. Meaning it limits everyday people from getting involved in crypto in the first place,”

Moreover, while audiences are still limited on emerging decentralized platforms, there are other challenges that still need to be addressed. Privacy rights, regulations, copyright protection and more must be resolved before serious YouTubers migrate their content to these platforms.

Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, chimed in on Twitter about the dilemma, saying, “It may be time the crypto community take a stab at its own blockchain-enabled sensorship-resistant social media platform. Lots of challenges though, spam, scam, trolls, incentives, copyright, token economics, governance, stickiness, privacy… But It’s about time!”","

If you are not someone following the ups and downs of bitcoin, you probably have not heard about a big event next year. It is called the “halving.” It will cut creation of the cryptocurrency by 50 percent.

A cryptocurrency is any form of money that exists online and operates without a central bank. Bitcoin is one of several such currencies.

No one person or group is in control of this halving process. It is a rule written into bitcoin’s computer program by its creator Satoshi Nakamoto more than 10 years ago.

The event is expected in May of 2020. It would cut by 50 percent the number of new bitcoins given to bitcoin miners. These miners create the world’s supply of cryptocurrency by solving complex mathematical questions.

The halving represents a big change in a market worth about $120 billion. Bitcoin worth several billion dollars are created every year.

Bitcoin market players are predicting sharp price increases as well as sharp drops in the value of the cryptocurrency. Such moves have happened in earlier halvings, which take place about every four years. The point of a halving is to keep down the number of bitcoins and control inflation.

There are likely to be winners and losers. So, those who buy and sell bitcoin are trying to predict the future of the cryptocurrency markets.

“This is the biggest question right now for most of the industry,” said Eyal Avramovich. He is chief executive of MineBest, a Poland-based company that mines bitcoin.

The drop in bitcoin’s production is one reason why the digital currency has not been accepted by established financial markets and organizations. Its future value is decided by technology and not, some say, by the rules of economics.

The rules of economics say that if supply is cut and demand stays the same, prices rise. The Reuters news agency spoke with seven cryptocurrency traders who said that the halving will lead to greater price volatility. They added that since the cut in supply is expected, the price may slowly rise or fall before the cut is made.

Making money from price swings

Bitcoin miners use modern, high-tech computers to compete against other computers in the cryptocurrency world. They are working to add new “blocks” to the blockchain ledger that supports the cryptocurrency.

Blockchain is the name of the system that records cryptocurrency creation, buying or selling. The system rests with many computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. It is believed that the network protects cryptocurrencies from attack and other financial crimes.

Bitcoin miners receive a set number of bitcoin, currently 12.5. The next halving will take place in May, when the number will drop to 6.25.

The two past halvings took place in November 2012 and July 2016. In the one year periods that followed, bitcoin’s value rose close to 80 times in 2012 and four times in 2016.

It is not clear how much of these price increases resulted from the halving. There may have been other influences.

Jeff Dorman is with Arca, a U.S. investment company specializing in cryptocurrency. He says bitcoin markets look like they will rise and fall during and after the halving event.

Such volatility in bitcoin markets is usually good for traders who work in the high-tech cryptocurrency industry because they can profit from a small change in price.

“For us, the event will be positive because it will cause activity in the market,” said Ha Duong. He is a cryptocurrency investor in Berlin who works for a large trading company.

Miners, however, hold large amounts of bitcoin. They do not want volatility. They want a leveling of prices, which enables them to invest in the newest computer technology to earn more bitcoin.

Every year, Bitcoin faces a new foe intent on crippling it by undermining the foundations it was built upon. From mining cartels to developer disputes, Bitcoin has faced a barrage of threats over the past decade. When it’s not internecine conflict taking its toll, it’s external forces including politicians and regulators seeking to exert control. In 2020, the cryptosphere will face one of its toughest challenges yet as the KYC war heats up.

The Battle Lines Have Been Drawn

This year, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued strict new global standards for crypto assets. In 2020, the guidance will begin to come into force, while in January the EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) kicks in. The upshot of this is more Know Your Customer (KYC) enforcement, stricter controls on buying and selling cryptocurrency, and increased compliance. Bad news for bitcoiners, in other words, who value their privacy.

The threat placed by the incoming legislation doesn’t just strip individuals of their right to anonymity, either – it also strips business owners of their livelihoods. Crypto payment service Bottle Pay, mining pool Simplecoin, and interactive bitcoin faucet Chopcoin have already been forced to shut down ahead of AMLD5. As news.Bitcoin.com reported:

Providers of crypto-related services, such as exchanges and custodial wallets, are considered “obliged entities” and will have to comply with the union’s AML regulations in the future. That means abiding by the rules applicable to other financial institutions including the obligation to perform customer due diligence and submit suspicious activity reports. That also applies to investment firms, tax advisors, accountants, notaries, and lawyers who transfer or receive payments equivalent to €10,000 and more.

A Global Problem

Encroaching KYC isn’t just a European Union problem: it’s a global one, as former fly-by-night exchanges start cleaning up their act and enforcing KYC to appease regulators, as they eye global expansion. Binance, which now operates multiple exchanges in various territories, has come under fire after its Singapore platform threatened to suspend a user for withdrawing to a coin mixing service. The backlash forced Binance CEO CZ to publish an AML explainer, but critics weren’t impressed, with one dubbing it a “statement by @cz_binance about how he is forced to boot-lick the local extortion gang by harassing his clients.”

Given that Binance and Huobi both operate out of Malta, there is speculation that the pair may be forced to enact blanket KYC to all users in the near future. At present, Binance’s main exchange enables withdrawals of up to 2 BTC without KYC provided its AML systems haven’t flagged the transaction as suspicious. Binance Singapore’s zero-tolerance policy for contraventions of its compliance standards is widely seen as the shape of things to come for every major exchange.

In ""Mars Attacks"" the Martians keep saying, ""WE COME IN PEACE"" as they disintegrate everything with ray guns. It's like Bitcoin companies sloganeering like revolutionaries when they're KYC enforcing, account closing, key custodying wannabe banks with a shiny face.

Maximalists Protest ‘Surveillance Exchanges’

Bitcoin maximalists, generally defined as hardcore bitcoiners who have short shrift for altcoins and anything else that falls outside their narrow interpretation of what Bitcoin should be, have bitterly protested the creeping KYC that has permeated the industry. “Buy BTC, Coinjoin, put it in your wallet, STFU & HODL. F*** surveillance exchanges,” tweeted one.

“Now is the moment to show you are a bitcoiner! Avoid KYC exchanges! Use HodlHodl or Bisq! Coinjoin your UTXOs!” entreated another. Under the hashtag #coinjoinday, bitcoiners have scheduled April 5, 2020 – Satoshi Nakamoto’s stated birthday – for using Coinjoin en masse to mix coins. The move is reminiscent of the Shuffle Saturdays favored by members of the BCH community who use Cashshuffle for the same purpose. In addition, Proof of Keys day is returning on January 3, when bitcoiners are encouraged to withdraw their crypto from exchanges and store it non-custodially.

Last week, the Marty’s Bent newsletter reflected on the latest spate of invasive KYC:

Time and time again throughout Bitcoin’s first decade, we have seen exchange after exchange pop up that promise a service without any KYC/AML compliance only to attain a certain scale, draw the ire of regulators, and force the compliance restrictions on their users. Withholding their funds from them until they send a picture of their passport, a selfie, information about where they work, where they live, and all other types of data that will surely be stored in an insecure way. A nice, old fashioned bait and switch tactic that seriously invades an individual’s privacy and could be seen as a form of financial harassment.

The Next Bitcoin War Will Be Over KYC

In defense of crypto exchanges, they are obliged to follow the law in every territory where they operate, and are not immune to AML legislation. Nevertheless, it’s hard to shake the sensation that platforms are sometimes overreaching in their desperation to appease regulators. The biggest determinant of how the KYC war plays out next year may have more to do with the fate of initial exchange offerings and altcoins. If BTC increases its dominance, IEOs continue their decline, and the market remains bearish, there will be few incentives for bitcoiners to trade on ‘surveillance exchanges.’

Conversely, a new alt season could tempt even cautious hodlers to endure KYC and its privacy incursions in a bid to make more BTC through trading. Whatever way the markets play out, 2020 is set to be a landmark year for crypto and KYC. Will the industry kowtow to KYC, or will there be a drive towards decentralized exchanges and more privacy-friendly platforms like Utorg, local.Bitcoin.com, and Bisq?

Cryptocurrencies have become valuable over the last few years and hardware wallets are now a mainstay within the cryptosphere. More recently, steel-crafted wallets that store crypto keys on a hard piece of metal have become increasingly popular. The following is a look at the wide variety of so-called ‘doomsday’ digital currency wallets fabricated from metal components.

The Steel Wallet Trend

Steel crypto wallets have become a popular form of storage in 2019 and there’s a slew of products crypto proponents can choose from today. News.Bitcoin.com reviewed a few steel wallets in the past that were created by the startup Cryptosteel. In January 2017, our newsdesk looked at Cryptosteel’s first iteration, which safely stores private keys, BIP39 compatible seeds, and secret cryptographic messages. In November 2019, news.Bitcoin.com reviewed the Cryptosteel Capsule, a steel cylinder device with 800 lettered tiles.

Moreover, Casa CTO and software developer Jameson Lopp has published his “Metal Bitcoin Seed Storage Stress Test” series, which covers steel wallet products extensively. People like the idea of metal-grade wallets that can last a long time and sustain critical amounts of damage. For instance, if a crypto holder’s home was on fire, an electronic hardware wallet or a paper seed would surely go up in flames. Steel wallets, although not perfect, can withstand a lot more stress and easily sustain water and fire damage. For example, steel can sustain heat temperatures around 2500°F, as aluminum can only withstand roughly 1225°F. Plastics have an extremely low melting point between 320°F and 410°F. Most hardware wallets today are constructed of plastic and aluminum components, which can be easily harmed by fire and water.

Crypto Key Stack

The Crypto Key Stack is a wallet that is shaped like a card but is manufactured with black anodized stainless steel that offers extreme fire protection. The startup claims the product can withstand fire heat up to 2200°F, which is twice the average temperature of a house fire. Users who purchase the Crypto Key Stack engrave their seeds with an electric engraver and the wallets are also waterproof and rust-resistant. The Explorers Stack product costs $70 dollars and it contains three blank mnemonic plates. The Crypto Key Stack comes with an engraver and plates can hold 24-word mnemonic seeds.

Crypto Keys

The $28 “Universal Key Package” made by Crypto Keys is another engravable wallet for mnemonic seed storage. Crypto Keys are also made of steel and the set comes with 13 double-sided keys, punch set, and stamping jig. The company sells a few different packages for different types of hardware wallets or mnemonic phrases. Each key is designed to store two words so 12 keys would be sufficient for a 24-word mnemonic. The 3D printed plastic stamping jig is used to align the letters on the metal key so the owner can punch set the words. Crypto Keys are durable steel pieces that can resist damage from floods and home fires.

Cyphersafe

The Cyphersafe Cypherwheel is an interesting looking steel wallet that stores BIP-0039 and SLIP-0039 private keys or other sensitive information. However, unlike the $70 Crypto Key Stack and the $28 Crypto Keys package, Cypherwheel has a hefty price tag at $200 per unit. But unlike the others, Cypherwheel can be locked with a padlock adding more security and it has the ability to store up to 96 characters. The metal wallet can withstand 2000 degrees of fire-based heat, and it’s also rust-proof and waterproof. Similar to the steel products mentioned above, Cyphersafe does carry a cheaper wallet called the Cypherplate which starts at $49.95 and has a unique numbered seal.

Steelwallet

Another metal wallet sold on the market today is Steelwallet, which is an offline steel backup tool that allows users to engrave a seed on two laser engraved sheets. Steelwallet packages are made of stainless A2 / ASIS 304 / SS304 steel and they can withstand fire, water, corrosion, and electricity. The two laser engraved sheets allow owners to store 12,18 and 24-word seeds or other types of encrypted secrets. The $65 Steelwallet package comes with a metal punching pen so customers can engrave their mnemonics. For a few dollars less, people can order two engraved steel sheets without the puncher.

Cryptosteel Capsule

The autonomous offline storage product called the Cryptosteel Capsule is a steel cylinder wallet that starts at $82. The capsule weighs 515 grams and there are 800 stress-resistant tiles included with the package. The shell is made of AISI 303 steel and has more than 99% coverage for hexadecimal strings up to 123 characters and random ASCII strings up to 55 characters. The company still carries the classic Cryptosteel Cassette products as well and they start at $92. Cryptosteel’s two steel wallet devices are also fire, water, and corrosion-resistant.

Simbit

The Simbit steel wallet uses a rail system so pre-made steel tiles can slide into place much like the original Cryptosteel Cassette. Simbit stores up to 114 characters and the package comes with 400 tiles to choose from. The product can withstand “prolonged exposure” to heat 600°F hotter than the typical house fire. Simbit uses 316 marine grade stainless steel alloy and because it uses this type of metal it is more corrosion-resistant than traditional stainless steel. One Simbit and 400 tiles cost $110 and the company sells packages of two as well.

Quadrat Register

The Quadrat Register is another cylinder-shaped metal wallet much like the Cryptosteel Capsule, although the Quadrat Register is far more expensive at $330 per unit and another $155 for the steel protective tube. Quadrat Register also offers two-point encryption because users can generate 128 different symbols or words and tether it to the GENESIS code list. Just like the other steel wallets mentioned above, Quadrat Register is fire and water-resistant as all the metal parts are made from German stainless steel.

A Myriad of Different ‘Doomsday’ Protection Features

There are many other types of metal wallets and products on the market today. Other variations can be made of metals such as iron and titanium, like the products sold by bulletproofbitcoin.com. Many long term holders appreciate the idea of extremely durable wallets, because they can withstand far more damage than a phone or electronic device. These benefits have invoked startups to create a wide variety of metal wallets that offer a myriad of ‘doomsday’ scenario protections such as shock resistance, higher melting points, and waterproof features. To some people, the steel wallet process seems extreme, but others wouldn’t use anything less than metal-grade products.

In 2011, Mike Caldwell created the notorious Casascius physical bitcoin collection, and since then the series of coins has become extremely valuable. Over the last two months, a bunch of people have redeemed their Casascius coins and on December 23 someone peeled a 100 BTC ($723K) Casascius bar.

2011-2013 Casascius Coins and Bars Sell for a Premium

Years ago, people made physical bitcoins and there’s been so many manufactured that there’s actually an encyclopedia that covers the subject. These days, however, there’s not as many physical bitcoin manufacturers as government regulations have stifled the industry. There are definitely a few creators still minting loaded crypto coins, but there’s nowhere near the number of physical coin makers as there was back in the day. Casascius coins are the most popular of all the physical BTC coinage ever created. Unfortunately on November 27, 2013, Caldwell had to suspend sales of all the items he manufactured that contained digital bitcoins. Throughout the Casascius manufacturing period, Caldwell minted coins and bars that contained 1, 10, 25, 100, and 1,000 BTC increments.

Casascius coins have always been in high demand and many have sold for a premium, well above the amount of BTC held on the metal. For instance, in April 2018, someone created a post on the shiresociety.com forum selling four 2011 Casascius coins for $10K per coin. Each of the coins sold on the website at the time contained a 1 BTC load under the hologram sticker. The price per BTC during the month of April 2018 was around $8k so the seller added a $2K per coin premium. On July 1, 2019, a 2011 mint-condition gold Casascius coin (MS65) that held 1 BTC sold for $99,000 on eBay. In November 2017, a Casascius physical bitcoin with a hologram error was purchased for $50K on the online auction site. In January 2018, another graded MS65 Casascius sold for $28.7K on Ebay.

100 BTC Casascius Bar Peeled

This week, on December 23, an individual peeled a 100 BTC Casascius bar currently worth $723K just for the BTC alone. According to data from casasciustracker.com, the Casascius S2-BAR-100 held 100 BTC and was created on February 4, 2013. In fact on Twitter, there’s a bot that tracks all the peeled (redeemed) Casascius coins and bars. The bot called @Casasciusbot recorded the last big peel, which saw a 25 BTC (S2-COIN-25) redeemed the day before.

100 BTC Casascius bar from 2013 was just peeled. 👀 https://t.co/7YX7HvirPT — Melik Manukyan ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️ (@melikmanukyan) December 23, 2019

In the last 30 days, the Casasciusbot has documented lots of coin peels mostly in increments of 1 BTC every few days. But there’s been plenty of higher denominations redeemed as well and many derive from the series 2 batch. The month of November saw 27 Casascius coins peeled worth approximately 71 BTC. 11 of those redeemed coins were from 2013 and the rest of the pieces derived from 2012 and 2011.

To date, there are 46,329 active BTC left on unredeemed Casascius coins and bars. There’s also been 44,940 BTC loaded Casascius-made products that have been peeled to date. It’s interesting to watch the timeline of people peeling these coins and wonder why they decided to redeem the funds now, especially when they might have more numismatic value in the future.

What do you think about the 100 BTC Casascius bar that was redeemed on December 23? Would you peel a Casascius coin or would you save it for a future date in time? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

A panel of crypto and blockchain experts from CEO mastermind group The Oracles recently shared where they think the digital currency market is headed in the coming years.

Their predictions, published in Entrepreneur, indicate a positive sentiment over the long term, with cryptocurrencies eventually gaining more traction, legitimacy and use.

According to Judd Rosenblatt, founder and CEO at AE Studio, a web development and data science consulting company, crypto is excellent long term.

“[We’re] constantly impressed with the progress and innovation that’s happening in the space. Blockchain technology is evolving fast and becoming increasingly important; so I think of crypto as an excellent long-term, albeit high-risk, investment.”

Lorenzo Pellegrino, CEO at Skrill, NETELLER and Income Access at Paysafe, says that while the crypto markets might have crashed, the growth of infrastructure enabling digital currency platforms has remained steady, with Bitcoin evolving into a relatively large, multi-billion dollar ecosystem.

Dan Schatt, co-founder and CEO at Cred, points out that the global financial crisis in 2008 decimated people’s life savings. Bitcoin emerged as an alternative system.

“[Bitcoin] has been declared dead by journalists 378 times, including 40 times this year. But Bitcoin won’t die because it can be trusted more than most government currencies. There is no intermediary. And in a world full of failed financial intermediaries, that is a big deal.”

According to Johann Polecsak, co-founder and CTO at QAN blockchain platform, mass adoption begins as the new technology enhances workflows, streamlining routine procedures for enterprises.

“When the internet started, companies had to integrate the technology to deliver content for users to consume. That’s where we are now with cryptocurrency, but we’re missing platforms that companies can leverage and are capable of operating on a global scale.”

Alex Althausen, CEO at StormGain, a crypto trading platform, recalls the year 1997, when Amazon stocks surged past $300 per share, but then crashed to under $6 once the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s. The stock is now trading at $1,789 per share.

Following Bitcoin’s tumultuous rise and fall, after reaching an all-time high of more than $19,000 in 2017, Althausen sees this same Amazon-style pattern happening with digital currencies.

“My advice is to keep an eye on the Bitcoin halving in 2020, which can dramatically change the cryptocurrency supply and demand equation.”

Rounding out the six influencers, legendary billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper, a long-time Bitcoin bull, stands by his prediction that BTC will trade at $250,000 by 2022 or early 2023. His timeline differs dramatically from veteran Wall Street trader Tone Vays, who claims Draper’s near-term predictions are far-flung.

“In a year, there will be no reason to pay banks 2.5 percent to 4 percent every time you swipe your credit card. Bitcoin is a frictionless transaction.”

I have often criticized the investment industry for pumping out products designed to sell rather than build wealth for investors. I have also worked to raise investor awareness of how gimmicky products destroy wealth. The battle against such products took a step backward recently with an Ontario Securities Commission panel’s decision to allow the launch of a bitcoin investment fund.

The OSC’s Investment Funds Branch was initially opposed to the fund; citing several concerns pertaining to public interests. The panel’s decision document clearly lays out the OSC’s legal limits when it comes to approving products that are considered risky and speculative. Ultimately, the panel concluded that the fund will be able to reliably value the fund’s assets, secure the holdings (from hacks/theft) and complete a full financial audit.

Many look to bitcoin – and other assets such as gold and other commodities – to provide diversification from traditional financial assets. An investment must meet two basic conditions for it to effectively diversify a portfolio. First, it must be weakly correlated with other investments. Second, it must produce a positive return. Bitcoin passes the first test with flying colours. But the second – a positive return – is quite a leap of faith, and violates the warning attached to virtually all investment products.

Regulators have long required every investment fund prospectus to be stamped with a statement reminding investors that past performance is no indication of the future. And yet, it seems that any assumption that bitcoin offers portfolio diversification is implicitly based on bitcoin’s performance during its one decade in existence. This is a drop in the bucket of financial market history. But there are two problems with this assumption.

First, we have no idea – even using history – how bitcoin will behave in a recession, financial crisis or bear market. History can be useful to gauge behavioural patterns and worst-case scenarios. But bitcoin hasn’t existed through any such environment.

Second, by claiming that bitcoin can diversify portfolios, I wonder what basis is used for assuming positive future returns. As I stated for a Globe and Mail article on the panel’s decision:

“We design client portfolios to achieve a specific goal – a specific long-term return target. I can take each component of the portfolio and give you a very good ballpark estimate of how each piece will contribute to achieving that long-term goal. I have no idea how anyone can do this with bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. It can’t be done.”

We have designed an algorithm to forecast long-term asset-class returns. (The method is summarized in a 2012 blog post and has been pretty accurate.) But bitcoin doesn’t fit into this or any other sensible model that facilitates a confident return forecast. I’m certainly not comfortable blindly relying on 10 years of data to form any type of future return expectation; particularly since that decade overlapped a very long economic recovery and bull market.

Bitcoin and other crypto or digital currencies are likely to have a future. And blockchain technology seems destined to change some industries – e.g., the way we handle legal documents. But investment assets require fundamental characteristics upon which to base some value assessment and, in turn, return expectations. In the absence of such characteristics, buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies either for attractive returns or portfolio diversification is speculating – not investing.",,
2019-12-26,"YouTube erroneously purged cryptocurrency education videos from its video-sharing platform this week but claims to have reinstated them, according to a spokesperson. Content creators, however, are telling a different story.

Responding to allegations it had intentionally deleted content from cryptocurrency education channels ChrisDunnTV, Crypto Tips, BTC Sessions and others in what apparently amounted to hundreds of missing videos, the spokesperson said YouTube made “the wrong call.”

“With the massive volume of videos on our site, sometimes we make the wrong call. When it’s brought to our attention that a video has been removed mistakenly, we act quickly to reinstate it. We also offer uploaders the ability to appeal removals and we will re-review the content,” the spokesperson said. YouTube has issued near-identical statements after previous inadvertent video purges.

The spokesperson further stated YouTube has not changed any policies related to cryptocurrency videos.

In spite of this, some YouTubers claim their deleted videos remain inaccessible. Chris Dunn, who runs an investment education channel with 200,000 subscribers and a multi-year video library, says the purge has actually gotten worse since he successfully appealed his deletions.

“Today, YouTube not only took down the videos that they reinstated yesterday, but they took down at least one other video that they’d never taken down before,” Dunn said.

At press time a number of videos are still missing from Dunn’s channel and others that CoinDesk directly asked YouTube about, like Crypto Tips. YouTube has not yet responded to follow-up questions.

The conflicting statements are sure to increase the furious speculation over why YouTube deleted the videos in the first place. Multiple theories abound. Dunn said he has no idea why it occurred – not all of his deleted videos had to do with crypto – but said it could be the work of someone “maliciously reporting” him and others or, perhaps, faulty video-flagging AI.

Dunn said YouTube flagged videos as “harmful or dangerous content” and the “sale of regulated goods.” Dunn told CoinDesk he does not sell products on his channel and does not monetize his videos with ads.

Regardless of the whether the purge was intentional or not, Dunn said he and other content creators have noticed YouTube target content it deems objectionable to itself or its advertisers.

He pointed to YouTube’s demonetization of violent political videos, like footage of the Hong Kong protests, and its recent terms of service update, which features a throwaway account termination clause with potentially far-reaching ramifications.

“YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable,” the Dec. 10 ToS update reads.

Dunn said he interprets that to mean YouTube can terminate creators who do not make it money.

He told CoinDesk he is seriously considering walking away from YouTube altogether. Contacted for additional comment Thursday, Dunn said he had a goodbye video ready to go and was only waiting for the situation to clear up.","Japan’s equivalent to Amazon, e-commerce giant Rakuten, is now allowing users to convert their earned loyalty points to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and bitcoin cash (BCH) cryptocurrencies.

The service is being provided by Rakuten’s cryptocurrency exchange, Rakuten Wallet, according to an announcement Tuesday. One “Rakuten Super Point” is equivalent to one yen (~$0.0091) when converted to cryptocurrencies.

Only regular Rakuten Super Points can be exchanged, the company said, adding that “Limited Time Points” cannot be exchanged. Users need to convert a minimum of 100 super points into cryptocurrencies, per the announcement.

Rakuten said the service is aimed at reducing the barriers of entry to cryptocurrency trading by providing an easier way to access the market. To get started, users need to have an account with Rakuten Wallet (registration is free) and then via the exchange’s app, they can convert loyalty points to cryptocurrencies.

There are limits on the number of Rakuten Super Points that can be exchanged per transaction and per month. In one transaction, “Diamond” members can convert a maximum of 50,000 points, while other members can only convert 30,000 points. And in one month, Diamond members can convert a maximum of 500,000 points and other members can only convert 100,000 points.

Rakuten Wallet is a licensed cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, registered with the Kanto Local Finance Bureau under the country’s Payment Services Act. Formerly known as “Everybody’s Bitcoin Inc.,” the exchange changed its name in March this year and started offering spot trading services in August.

Rakuten said at the time that it believes “the role of cryptocurrency-based payments in e-commerce, offline retail and in P2P [peer-to-peer] payments will grow in the future.”

Rakuten’s e-commerce unit started accepting bitcoin payments in 2015 when it integrated its U.S. website with bitcoin wallet provider Bitnet.","KEY POINTS Ethereum co-founder cashes out 90,000 ETH on Christmas Day

Jeff Wilcke said he will use funds for his ""game""

The co-founder's wallet still contains 218,000 ETH

When 204,000 Ethereum (ETH) moved to different exchanges on Christmas day, the crypto community was left scratching their heads, mystified as to who could have caused such a massive selloff.

The total Ethereum that went on to be cashed out is worth, at today's prices, almost $26 million. It was even linked to the man behind the project himself, Vitalik Buterin.

Out of the 204,000 ETH, though, 90,000 ($11.3 million) was sent to U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, which was traced all the way to another Ethereum co-founder, Jeff Wilcke. According to the cryptocurrency news website BeInCrypto, Wilcke would not have been identified had he not signed up for Ethereum Name Service (ENS) in 2017.

Cointelegraph also notes that in 2016 an account that is funded by the Ethereum Foundation dev wallet transferred a total of 408,000 ETH to a particular ox600 address and in the span of three-plus years showed a regular movement of funds until a sharp decrease on Dec. 25 this year.

The wallet still contains 218,000 ETH ($27.4 million), but the 90,000 that caused the decline went to Kraken.

Wilcke didn't deny his action, and he admitted this through a now-deleted tweet that he will be using the cash for his game.

When something like this happens in the crypto world where someone who owns a large number of cryptos -- which in this case is a co-founder of one the second-largest crypto by market cap -- cashes out, it is usually not a good sign for crypto fans. It doesn't mean that faith for Ethereum plummets as a result of this, but it does project a sense of uncertainty in the face of those who are widely optimistic about the crypto world's prospects. Had this been a Bitcoin whale cashing out a fortune of BTC on Christmas day, the entire market would probably be in a selling frenzy.

But Wilcke has not had any contributions on GitHub for the past nine months. And like what he tweeted about, he is perhaps working on Grid-Games, which is a video game studio that he is a co-founder of according to his profile on the software development platform.

While Wilcke admitted what his purpose was for the 90,000 ETH, the identity of the sellers behind the remaining the 114,000 ETH is still a mystery -- but perhaps some of those sellers were just in a rush for some late Christmas shopping.

On top of this, a new cryptocurrency question was added to 1040 Schedule 1 asking all taxpayers: “At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”

What does this mean for tax professionals? In short, all tax preparers will now have to ask their clients whether they have any cryptocurrency related activities during the year. This also means that tax preparers must be ready to handle cryptocurrency taxation for their clients.



How does the IRS treat cryptocurrencies for taxes?

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not taxed outright. In other words, simply owning bitcoin doesn’t create a tax liability. Rather, it’s the gains and losses that you incur when buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrencies which ultimately need to be reported on your tax return.

Boiled down, the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property for tax purposes, not as currency. In this sense, buying and selling cryptocurrencies triggers capital gains and losses reporting requirements just as they would for buying and selling stocks, another form of property.

For example, if you purchased 0.1 Bitcoin for $1,000 in January of 2019 and then sold it two months later for $3,000, you have a $2,000 capital gain. You report this gain on your tax return, and depending on what tax bracket you fall under, you will pay a certain percentage of tax on the gain. Rates fluctuate based on your tax bracket as well as depending on whether it was a short term vs. a long term gain.

What does increased IRS enforcement mean for your tax practice?

It’s no secret that a large percentage of people who trade and invest in cryptocurrencies have not been reporting nor paying taxes on their gains. I see this first hand with the thousands of users who come to us here at CryptoTrader.Tax and work to amend two or three years worth of tax returns. This general lack of compliance is going to come to a screeching halt with this new Schedule 1. Crypto investors will no longer be able to claim that “they weren’t aware” of the fact that their crypto transactions were taxable. This new question is going to dramatically increase tax compliance.

This increased scrutiny creates both an opportunity and a threat for your tax prep business. The opportunity is clear: if your firm is able to effectively help cryptocurrency investors, traders, and users easily and accurately report their crypto income on their tax return, you will be able to acquire premium clients at a high rate. On the other hand, if you are unable to assist your existing clients who must check “yes” to investing in cryptocurrency on their 1040 Schedule 1, you are at risk of losing them.

How can you prepare to service crypto clients?

Before you can start assisting the millions of crypto investors out there who are going to need to file their crypto activity, you need to educate yourself on the world of cryptocurrency taxation. There is a wealth of material online that you can get started with including the 2014 IRS guidance, the 2019 FAQ about virtual currencies, as well as other guides breaking down bitcoin tax implications.

On top of this, there are a variety of software companies out there that are focused on providing tools for tax professionals to help with the crypto tax reporting process for clients. It is wise to do you research and find the best options.

The increased IRS scrutiny towards cryptocurrency tax compliance presents a great opportunity to grow your tax business. Don’t be put off by the seemingly technical concepts that virtual currencies present. You do not need to be a technologist to grasp these concepts—a little research goes a long way.","The total crypto market cap is holding the key $182.0B and $180.0B support levels.

Bitcoin price is trading above the $7,200 support and it could start a fresh increase.

Litecoin (LTC) price is slowly rising and it might test the $41.20 resistance.

BCH price is up 4% and it is moving higher towards the $200 resistance area.

EOS price is rising and it seems like it could attempt to clear the $2.700 resistance.

Binance coin (BNB) is struggling to clear the $13.50 and $13.80 resistance levels.

Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto market cap are holding key support levels. Many altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), binance coin (BNB), ripple, litecoin, BCH, EOS, TRX, and ADA are consolidating.

Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis

After a downside correction, bitcoin cash price found support near the $185 level against the US Dollar. BCH price is currently moving higher and it is trading above the $190 level. The price is up around 4% and it could continue to rise towards the $200 resistance level.

On the downside, the $185 level is a major support area. If there is a downside break below the $185 support, the price could revisit the $170 support area.

Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC) and EOS Price Analysis

Binance coin (BNB) price found support near the $12.80 level and recently recovered above the $13.00 level. BNB price is currently consolidating near $13.20 and it might rise slowly towards the main $13.50 and $13.80 resistance levels.

Litecoin price is somehow holding the $40.00 support levels. On the upside, an initial resistance for LTC/USD is near the $41.20 level, above which the price is likely to accelerate higher. The next major resistance is seen near the $42.50 level. On the downside, the main supports are $39.50 and $48.40.

EOS price is trading with a positive bias above the $2.500 resistance area. If the price continues to rise, it could face hurdles near the $2.650 and $2.700 levels. On the downside, a clear break below the $2.500 level might start another decline towards the $2.300 level in the near term.

Looking at the total cryptocurrency market cap hourly chart, there was a failed breakout attempt near the $195.0B resistance area. The crypto market cap is now near the $185.0B level and it seems like it could rise slowly towards the $195.0B resistance.

Conversely, a break below the $182.0B support might spark a fresh decrease in bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, litecoin, ripple, ADA, BCH, XLM, BNB, TRX, XMR, and other altcoins in the near term.","Fiat gateway infrastructure provider Simplex has partnered with cryptocurrency wallet provider Broxus to facilitate buying of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) directly via Telegram.

Late last week, Binance’s Singapore arm threw crypto Twitter into a frenzy with reports that it had allegedly suspended one user’s account. The problem? That user, @bittlecat, had tried sending their bitcoin to the hash-scrambling Wasabi wallet in an apparent violation of Binance SG’s anti-money-laundering (AML) policies.

Binance SG refused to transact “directly or indirectly” with a variety of often illicit-tied crypto services, “especially darknet/mixer sites,” according to @bittlecat’s tweets of their email exchange with Binance SG support.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

@bittlecat’s suspension was temporary. But if Binance SG’s anti-mixing policy holds – especially if it spreads to other exchanges – developers and observers say it could cut the crypto ecosystem in two.

“I think the exchanges are slowly coming to a crossroads,” said Gergely Hajdu, a developer with Wasabi wallet.

Users of privacy-enhanced wallets may find it ever-harder to move coins to and from regulated exchanges.

“Some exchanges may be completely foreclosed,” Hajdu said. “It will be so bad that I can’t express.”

On one side of this chasm: the crypto service providers embracing oversight from their local regulators and global watchdogs like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). And on the other side: privacy-conscious users, some of whom turn to shadowy-but-not-necessarily-illegal coin mixing services to shield what they hold.

“The big picture is more regulation is coming, and it’s gonna make this look, pretty normal in a couple of years,” said Tom Maxon, Head of U.S. operations for blockchain security company CoolBitX.

A regulatory sprint

Observers see this as one battle in the larger war to determine crypto’s direction.

There are the space’s early ideals, its proponents preaching as they did a decade ago, that bitcoin will bring privacy and financial autonomy to millions – irrespective of borders. Bitcoin, it was said, could be the decentralized answer to a world in seemingly constant consolidation mode.

Bitcoin could be traded peer-to-peer. Bought on exchanges. Shuffled between wallets (essentially digital bank accounts) that carried no personal identifiers. Mixed on services like Wasabi Wallet to make tracing it hard.

But that vision never sat well with governments. Nor with their regulators, wary of a financial instrument they could not control.

“Regulators are not comfortable with gray,” Maxon said.

And as millions – then billions – of dollars began flowing into bitcoin and other crypto assets, chief players around the globe began pushing for some way to regulate it.

The laws came slowly at first. Now, however, intergovernmental organizations like the FATF have set the world up for a regulatory sprint. FATF’s June guidance on a “risk-based approach for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers” gave financial regulators the world over a unified understanding upon which police the space.

FATF’s guidance hardly bans “virtual assets.” Nor does its global framework rule out “mixing services.” But it highlights their money-laundering risks, teeing up regional rule-makers for a crackdown on “obfuscatory” technologies that governments like Singapore’s have hinted at.

Maxon’s firm is developing a tool to help exchanges deal with the FATF’s travel rule, an outcome of the June guidance that pushes “virtual asset service providers” to share reams of customer data – much like the requirements traditional banks face. He sees the potential split as almost inevitable.

“The regulators are going to move this forward more swiftly than we’ve seen before,” Maxon said. “And then the ramifications, like these other services like mixers are going to be harder to use. It’s that kind of stuff that’s going to peter out over the coming years.”

Mixing in the gray zone

Mixing obscures the path one’s cryptocurrency takes; in the case of Hajdu’s Wasabi wallet, a Chaumian CoinJoin mixer scrambles multiple parties’ unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) into a nearly untraceable cryptographic mess. Put simply: multiple parties send their coins to multiple receivers in one transaction, making it hard to suss out who sent what to whom.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has not thrown out mixing entirely. Its webpage on the FATF guidelines does, though, say that virtual asset service providers should take careful note of “factors that could obfuscate transactions.”

But Binance’s global public relations head Leah Li said in an email statement that its Singapore exchange was following regulators’ lead.

“Binance SG operates under the requirements as set forth by MAS and our MAS regulated partner, Xfers. Hence there are AML CFT controls set in place for the Binance SG and the user triggered one of its risk control mechanisms,” Li said.

Casey Bohn, a law enforcement educator with America’s National White Collar Crime Center, said MAS’ hint-hint-nudge-nudge is more than enough for companies like Binance.

“From a corporate perspective, it’s a lot easier for me as a regulated money business to have a policy saying, ‘Hey man, we’re not going to allow this [activity] even though it’s perfectly legal because we don’t want heat from the regulators,” said Bohn.

Bohn said he believes the public has an inherent right to financial privacy. And though his cryptocurrency investigations often rely on the bitcoin blockchain, he nonetheless supports an individual’s desire to live off the map.

By the same token, he is skeptical that exchanges should be calling the shots over what’s permissible, and what’s not. He points out that right now an exchange has no way of knowing who controls a destined account once its user withdraws.

“Let’s say the exchange takes action against me based only on their assumption that the next wallet is still under my possession. Do we really want the technology corporations to be the arbiter?” he said.

Real-time tracing

Binance contracts with third-party service providers like Chainalysis to help it trace crypto transactions. These crypto-sleuths develop hefty tools to track asset movements; Chainalysis’ “Know-Your-Transaction” (KYT) software does so in real time.

Wasabi transactions have a “pretty unique” identifier that makes it “very easy to identify them in numerous ways,” according to Wasabi developer Bálint Harmat. But he insisted that his mixer, and others, are not inherently illegal. He also noted that Wasabi has reached out to Binance and Chainalysis to clarify the situation and prevent future issues.

A spokesperson for Chainalysis echoed that sentiment in an email statement.

“While mixers themselves are not illegal, we know that stolen funds from hacks and scams are often laundered through mixers. We recommend that our cryptocurrency exchange customers configure Chainalysis KYT to flag large transfers or high-velocity small transfers from mixers for further investigation because it could prevent criminals from cashing out stolen funds.”

Regulatory gears are already moving in radically anti-anonymity directions. Maxon, the CoolBitX executive, said FATF’s travel rule will have the most visible and immediate repercussions. Exchanges, he said, will develop user-filled forms built into their interface.

“Who are you sending this crypto transaction to? What is their name? What is their account number on that exchange?” he said, illustrating how those forms will appear.","Along with optimism about increasing the level of safety in the crypto industry, there are many fears that are far from groundless. This year, hacker attacks have been repeatedly recorded. Although ways are being sought to secure online work with cryptocurrencies, traders still prefer to remain anonymous during transactions. Therefore, according to cooltechzone.com, it is almost impossible to do without the use of a specific crypto-VPN service.

VPNs Change Crypto Trading for Better

Traveling traders often utilize public Wi-Fi networks to access the Internet. Sadly, these public networks make it easier for hackers to access user devices and info. Specific encryption protocols make data about crypto transactions inaccessible and protected from cyber-attacks. Moreover, only the trader and the final recipient of the service have the data of the decryption keys. However, they can be seen by hackers if a trader uses public Wi-Fi. But you can save yourself using VPN.

How VPNs Protect Crypto Traders

Even though the greatest risk correlated with cryptocurrency is the susceptibility of Internet exchanges to hackers, this is far from the only nuisance. Offline wallets are still very unreliable. Bitcoin addresses are still not anonymous enough, as are the addresses of new cryptocurrencies. In this case, the identification of the owner’s account is revealed by a simple comparison of IP. Using a VPN can considerably reduce the risk of these and other common crypto threats. As a result, nothing will disturb you from making money.

Advantages of Crypto-VPNs

Trading cryptocurrencies remains risky for many people, despite the continued success in the security field of online traders. Using a crypto VPN, you can get the anonymity of your transactions, trading operations, and account balances. This kind of VPN connection is similar to military-grade encryption, which makes it unlikely that a hacker or government agency will gain access to your information. Since fake exchanges and fraudulent ICOs are still common, it is extremely important to use a reliable crypto VPN that does not store logs and in no way compromises the trust of users.

Not All VPNs are Good

Even though there are countless good VPNs on the market, not all of them provide the proper level of safeguarding, speed, and performance that crypto traders demand. For example, CyberGhost is one of the most popular VPN services used by traders. A large server network consists of more than 1,200 servers at more than 50 points and has a speed that is above average. The VPN also offers 256-bit encryption, a non-logged-in connection, malware protection, and highly effective adblocking.

Another very popular VPN service is NordVPN, known as one of the safest to use. NordVPN not only has one of the largest VPNs in terms of servers and locations but also supports up to six devices at a time. Nord uses dual VPN technology that routes your linkage through two independent servers, greatly enhancing security.

Carefully Weigh Your Choice

Unfortunately, there is no absolute security in the world, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies and online trading. Using a VPN during online trading can significantly reduce the risk that you will replenish the sad statistics of users who became victims of a leak of personal data and similar crimes.","France’s top financial regulator has published new rules regarding the licensing of digital asset service providers (DASPs) as well as guidelines for firms applying for the non-mandatory license and informing the regulator about internal cybersecurity practices.

The Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) or Financial Markets Authority released the rules on Wednesday and the guidelines on Thursday last week, opening up the opportunity for firms to apply. The rules and guidelines expand upon France’s PACTE law, one of the first crypto legislative packages passed in Europe. PACTE passed in May 2019.

To apply, each DASP has to send the AMF a two-year business plan, a list of digital assets the firm is going to service, the list of geographies the firm will operate in and the firm’s organizational chart among other things.

Licensed DASPs are required to have professional indemnity insurance or a minimum amount of reserve funds, at least one effective senior manager, resilient IT systems, an internal control system, a claims handling procedure, an organization enabling it to avoid conflicts of interests and procedures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.

The license is optional for crypto firms operating in France, however. The French government only mandates that crypto custodians and any firm dealing with fiat-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat services register with the AMF for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing reasons.

The French regulator also released specific rules for crypto custodians, crypto exchanges, crypto broker-dealers, and crypto custodians.

“To the best of my knowledge it’s the first time we’ve seen precisely how a custodian has to maintain the key to assets on blockchain, and what is the role and liability of the custodian,” said Hubert de Vauplane, a partner at law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel.

The French government, with the help of the AMF, has defined crypto-asset custody service as “mastering” the “means of access” (cryptographic keys) for a third party’s digital assets and keeping track of their positions, said Emilien Bernard-Alzias, a partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons in Paris. New rules for licensed custodians under its general regulations include multi-validation for customers’ transactions and compensating clients if the custodian cannot restore control of those assets.

In its guidelines, the AMF notes the security risks that blockchain poses and asks crypto firms to provide the regulator with a detailed cybersecurity program that mitigates risks and complies with Europe’s general data protection regulation. Crypto firms are responsible for the cybersecurity of the digital asset service they provide and must undergo regular technical audits."

The man claiming to have invented bitcoin says he doesn't know where the key to his fortune is, and a recent court ruling called for him to forfeit $3 billion worth of his holdings.

Craig Wright, the purported creator, told Bloomberg he ""cannot be certain that information will in fact arrive"" to prove his claim to the bitcoin fortune.

Earlier in 2019, a judge ruled that the late Dave Kleiman owned half of the coins Wright mined through 2013, and that Wright must forfeit that half to Kleiman's estate.

Watch bitcoin trade live here.

The man who claims to have invented bitcoin may not be able to give up $3 billion of his crypto riches for a court ruling because he doesn't know when he'll have access to the coins, Bloomberg reported.

Craig Wright, the alleged creator, told Bloomberg in a statement he ""cannot be certain that information will in fact arrive"" to prove his claim to the assets.

Wright was ordered earlier in 2019 to surrender the crypto sum after a judge ruled he owned only half of the coins he mined through 2013, according to Bloomberg. The late Dave Kleiman held the rights to the other half of the fortune, US Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ruled, adding that Wright has no legal claim to that portion of the mined cryptocurrency.

Each half of the sum was worth as much as $4 billion, Bloomberg reported, but the price of bitcoin has since fallen.

Many in the bitcoin community don't believe Wright created the coin, with some even claiming he doesn't own as many as he claims to, Bloomberg reported. Others are worried that, should he forfeit the multibillion-dollar sum, bitcoin's value could be affected.

Wright added that he never said the ""private keys"" to the other half of the bitcoin fortune would be available or used in January.

""I do not intend to dump my family's BTC as some people suspect or want, as this would hurt many people in the industry,"" Wright said in the statement to Bloomberg.

The judge found ""clear and convincing evidence"" that Wright's encrypted bitcoin trust file doesn't exist and that his testimony was ""intentionally false,"" Roche Freedman lawyer Vel Freedman, representing the Kleiman estate, told Bloomberg in an email.

The lawsuit is ongoing.

Bitcoin traded at $7,212.08 per coin at 2:50 p.m. ET Friday, up about 93% year-to-date.

In a Dec. 27 announcement on the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) website pointed out the risks of the resurgence of digital currencies, such as the escalation of crypto trading activities, digital currency mortgage provision and introduction of zero-interest loans, as well as serious violations of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) provisions. Signatory to the announcement were four Beijing-local regulators.

To address risks, the regulators issued a warning and called local authorities to combat cryptocurrency-related illegal activities in Beijing. The warning reiterated the Chinese government’s negative stance towards cryptocurrencies, stating that both legal entities and individuals cannot carry out virtual currency sales, investments or transactions, nor engage domestic or foreign agents to trade cryptocurrencies.

China’s crackdown on crypto

Recently, the PBoC enhanced its crackdown on cryptocurrency-related operations in the country. In a statement on Nov. 21, the bank warned that it was taking action against entities involved in trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), which hit the crypto markets hard.

That same month, the city of Shenzhen revealed an investigation into cryptocurrency trading operations, again spearheaded by the PBoC. Industry leaders, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, nonetheless praised what Zhao saw as an effort to remove bad actors.

In late October, China voiced support for blockchain technology, but warned not to “speculate” about cryptocurrencies as blockchain should not be read as support for crypto. The People’s Daily, a publication under the direct control of the ruling political power, the Communist Party of China, wrote at the time:

“The rise of blockchain technology was accompanied by that of cryptocurrencies, but innovation in blockchain technology does not mean we should speculate in virtual currencies.”

In the meantime, the PBoC deputy director Mu Changchun said that the digital form of the yet-to-be-released yuan will be different to Bitcoin and stablecoins.","Editor’s Note: Tarun Wadhwa is CEO of Day One Insights, a strategy and advisory firm focusing on corporate reinvention, and a visiting fellow at Emory University’s Department of Political Science.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.

Since Bitcoin arrived in 2009, there has been growing economic and ideological interest in perfecting money that is native to the internet, and its popularity has sparked thousands of iterations. Blockchain-based digital money was indeed supposed to make our financial systems more free, fair and transparent. But where visionaries saw improvements over traditional finance, criminal enterprises saw opportunities.

Sure, the traditional financial system is regularly used by traffickers and terrorists, but cryptocurrencies have some attributes that are especially attractive for illicit activity. Unlike payments through banks, blockchain-based transactions settle in a matter of minutes. There’s no central authority to handle disputes, and transfers are irreversible. One currency can be rapidly traded for another. Security company CipherTrace notes that while only a fraction of Bitcoin transactions is used for crime, it’s also true that “nearly all dark market commerce is transacted in cryptocurrencies.”

One key area that has been repeatedly attacked are cryptocurrency exchanges, companies that allow customers to purchase and trade different types of digital assets. They “handle the money,” so they have the most sensitive role. Despite that, these businesses are notorious for the shady practices they enable, like insufficient verification of listings, abusive trading activity and rampant conflicts of interest. Cryptocurrency exchanges are rife with fraud and constantly being hacked. While this has led to many lost fortunes, there’s far more than money at stake.

Take North Korea. A March report from the United Nations Security Council found that Kim Jong Un and the North Korean regime have been exploiting vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency exchanges to evade sanctions and fund their military ambitions. So far, it’s been a huge success. Between January 2017 and September 2018, state-sponsored hackers have stolen $571 million worth of tokens from cryptocurrency exchanges across Asia, according to one estimate cited in the UN report.

North Korea is not the only rogue state looking to leverage cryptocurrencies. Venezuela had explored creating its own cryptocurrency to bypass sanctions imposed by the United States.

Non-state actors are constantly evolving their tactics, too. The United States has accused two Iranians of using Bitcoin in a digital extortion campaign. Middle East Media Research Institute, a research and analysis organization, has observed an uptick in jihadi organizations soliciting donations in cryptocurrency through social media, particularly on the messaging app Telegram. The founder of Telegram has defended the company’s policies and said during a “60 Minutes” interview in 2016 that it is trying to do more to stop terrorist groups from using the service.

Fighters around the region are using cryptocurrency to fund attacks, purchase weapons, obtain equipment and support their families. Elliptic, a company that develops tools to track how cryptocurrencies are used in criminal activity, has found that Hamas, the Palestinian fundamentalist militant organization, has deployed a method to make some of their donations nearly untraceable by providing each visitor a different Bitcoin address to send payments to.

Staging a terrorist attack can cost as little as a few thousand dollars. With cryptocurrencies, that sort of money can be raised almost instantly by scamming users, attacking businesses or manipulating financial markets. For a state-sponsored hacker with nearly unlimited resources, the potential earnings can be far greater.

Blockchain entrepreneurs and developers now need to develop and adopt the guardrails, protections and the oversight necessary for a global financial system. That means learning from the existing financial system while still embracing the security advantages unique to blockchain. Banks can be greedy and ineffective, but they have built complex and reliable ways to build, test and maintain systems that are worth emulating. With a cultural focus on reducing risk, these institutions have clear guidelines, train employees extensively and strictly adhere to compliance laws.

Most blockchains allow you to build policies and rules in the data, which requires a more thoughtful strategy, but can be used to prevent problems and create a system that is capable of correcting itself. Entrepreneurs should develop a set of standards, limits and restrictions directly into the function of the blockchain itself. This could include mandating advanced forms of cryptography, building in insurance policies if data is misused, or setting rules for how updates can be made in the future.

Public policy groups can be helpful here by creating and disseminating clear procedures for the industry to follow. Most notably, The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental organization, has produced guidelines on how cryptocurrency businesses should share the identity information of users who transact in their markets.

Heavy-handed regulation is not the way to go. But if developers fail to improve, governments will be forced to step in and take drastic action. That will likely lead to burdensome regulations, or worse, criminalization. In fact, US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Sigal Mandelker warned that if foreign financial institutions, including cryptocurrency exchanges, do not build appropriate safeguards, then the United States will work to make sure “that non-compliant networks and fintechs do not survive.”

A much more aggressive policing approach appears to be on the horizon. Law enforcement priorities will outweigh the efficiencies and opportunities made possible by blockchain, constraining a promising field of economics.

Blockchain’s greatest asset is the passionate community of developers behind it. But the work they’ve done to improve the world is now being hijacked by those who want to commit acts of violence and create instability. We need to fix this situation in order to move the industry forward. Without serious course corrections, a movement to create government-less currency is on track to become yet another tool for nations to undermine each other.","This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Ben Edgington advises on Eth2 across ConsenSys. Prior to joining ConsenSys, he was Head of Engineering for Information Systems at Hitachi Europe.

My life would be much easier if I could give you an exact date when Ethereum 2.0 will go live, if I could show you a two-year committed roadmap or explain precisely how cross-shard transactions will preserve DeFi composability. I’m pretty sure failing to have answers on issues like these would have gotten me fired from my old, corporate job.

But I am completely confident of this: 2020 is Ethereum 2.0’s year of delivery. The signal event will be the genesis of the beacon chain in the early part of the year. With three or four production-ready clients and 500,000 ether staked, this new Proof-of-Stake chain will start completing the first and most challenging phase of Eth2’s delivery.

How can I be so sure of this yet relaxed about not having all the details nailed down? Well, that’s the magic of Ethereum’s development approach. It’s an approach I’ve learned to trust over the 18 months we have been building this. Amid all the market ups and downs and all the competitive uncertainties, this approach continues to deliver. I call it ethereum’s superpower.

Doing things the way they have always been done is not going to change the world. Ethereum’s ambition is to be world-changing. It has to be global, distributed, inclusive and empowering. Unless our development process is equally global, distributed, inclusive and empowering, then Conway’s law – that systems reflect the structures of the organizations that design them – says we’re going to fail.

This is the “bazaar” model of development described by Eric S Raymond in his classic work on open source software. But we’ve taken it further. We’re applying this approach to the development of the Eth2 protocol itself, its very design and the R&D behind it.

The idea is to inspire a broad community around a shared purpose and focus its collective energy on the task. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry put it like this, “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”

This can look a bit messy. It can be a little chaotic and inefficient. The world can see our dirty laundry, which inevitably invites criticism. A report published in February recommended more “centralization of control” over development. A more recent article identified teams working “with different agendas and different timelines” as a risk area. In response I quote Scott’s Law: Never put order in a system before you understand the structure underneath its chaos.

Ethereum’s superpower is the engagement this approach inspires. By not insisting on being too tidy, we are able to engage a huge community. The sense of a shared endeavor draws in brilliant people who we might never otherwise have found. No fewer than eight independent client teams have delivered working Proof of Stake implementations. Do we need eight implementations? Perhaps not, but the engineering insight and expertise each brings serves to hone and improve the specification way beyond what any single team could achieve, across all areas from security to performance.

Another benefit of having an open, engaged community is getting fast feedback. Our initial scaling design called for 1,024 shard chains. People outside the core protocol team were able to review this and raise concerns about future developer experience that we were able to improve with a redesign. I am convinced that in a more traditional development environment this would have been addressed too late or not at all. We were able to pivot quickly, with very minor impact compared to the benefits gained.

Central to our approach is recognizing good ideas can come from anywhere. It’s fair to say that at the start of 2019, we didn’t have a clear view on how we would layer smart contract execution on top of the shard chains. The design space is large and there were many possible directions to explore. But, true to form, a proposal emerged on a community forum that was picked up by the Quilt team at ConsenSys that is now exploring and implementing the design.

Of course, our approach is not perfect. Some inefficiencies are real. But in our world it is a mistake to optimize for efficiency over engagement. In any case, our approach doesn’t seem to have slowed us down. We are very much on track with our expected development trajectory.

The real proof of our open, organic development approach will come in the first months of 2020. We are on track to go live with ethereum 2.0’s beacon chain, and the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake will be officially underway – part of the vision of ethereum since its earliest days.","This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world.

Nation states made a more substantive impact this year than the 10 previous years of crypto combined. China’s statist approach, in particular, may prove to be a catalyst to the still-elusive “mass adoption of crypto.”

In the U.S., the SEC made headlines with several high-profile enforcements including EOS, Telegram and kin, while federal lawmakers made their presence felt regarding Facebook’s Libra. FINCEN’s KYC/AML guidance factored prominently, and token sales and SAFT rounds slowed in 2019, driving much of the fundraising activity towards exchange platforms and causing a short blip of popularity in IEOs.

Regulatory action may have caused deal flow to slow, U.S. entrepreneurs and investors say, even if Silicon Valley will continue to produce some of the most compelling innovation in blockchain. As the industry moves forward into bitcoin’s second decade, there will continue to be high-drama friction as we try to reconcile crypto-anarchist ideals of pseudonymous participation with long-standing regulations around securities, KYC/AML and money-transmission laws.

We saw cross-border collaboration around the FATF enforcement recommendations, calling for exchanges to share customer information. But it remains to be seen whether this mandate will affect exchange activity or if it will drive a renaissance in decentralized exchange volume in 2020.

During the first three quarters, we saw China step forward and embrace blockchain technologies. The People’s Bank of China announced plans for a national sovereign digital currency, the DCEP. Industry observers and PBoC’s development team expect it to launch in 2020. President Xi Jinping’s comments regarding China’s desire to lead in blockchain technology were almost certainly strategically timed on the back of the Facebook hearings.

China’s leadership in our industry has been playing out for some time. More than two-thirds of bitcoin mining happens in China and exchange volume is dominated by Chinese markets (for example, more than 60 percent of Tether trading). Most importantly, more consumer-facing Web3 apps are coming out of China than any other market globally. At the time of this writing, eight of the top 10 dapps are developed by and/or for the Chinese market.

While Western crypto purists continue to point to concerns over privacy and surveillance of the DCEP, this is an overly simplistic evaluation in my opinion. I am confident Chinese ingenuity will lead towards a myriad of relatively seamless bridges between high-privacy crypto-networks and the regulated DCEP. I estimate the DCEP most directly impacts Chinese demand for Tether and other stablecoins going forward.

After years of waiting patiently in vain for “mass adoption of crypto,” I think we should be open-minded here.

The Chinese market also drove much of the bitcoin and ethereum market rebound in the first half of the year as Chinese investors sought to diversify their personal stores of value amid their nation’s trade war with the U.S. Enormous scams like the multi-billion-dollar Plus Token embezzlement caused regional governments to take a stronger stance on exchanges, driving down prices and showing China’s influence on crypto markets. Chinese officials are in the “blockchain not bitcoin/tokens” camp, but recognize crypto’s market popularity. It seems like many sovereigns are trying to reconcile the power and potential of blockchain technologies with unsettling risks.

Chinese consumers have a certain affinity for foreign crypto projects, possibly due to perceptions around security, privacy and technical prowess. But 2020 will bring forward the first crop of technically sophisticated mainland-based projects. Local startups have evolved beyond the early fast-follower experiments into a new generation of very legitimate technical teams with novel crypto-economic models (for example, Nervos, Sperax, Bihu).

Crypto may be remembered as one of the first industries (but certainly not the last) where China takes the position of technical innovator rather than fast-follower, sitting at the vanguard of development in Web3 technologies. In fact, we may even look back on the DCEP as a harbinger of China’s strategic shift towards reserve-currency status.","Ethereum research scientist Virgil Griffith, who was arrested last month for allegedly assisting North Korea in learning more about blockchain and cryptocurrencies, has been denied bail.

Since the inception of Bitcoin, governments have tried to keep track of all the transactions taking place on the public blockchain. As the years progressed, authorities have shown a distaste for cryptocurrency mixing applications like Coinjoin. On Dec. 19, a Binance customer couldn’t withdraw his bitcoin because the exchange told him he used the mixing wallet Wasabi. Eventually, the customer got his funds back, but only after promising not to deposit to a tumbling wallet again.

Coin Tumbling Users Beware

The battle for cryptocurrency anonymity is upon us and governments are invading the very decentralized frameworks designed to bypass their so-called authority. Last Thursday, a Binance customer explained on Twitter that his funds were frozen because he was withdrawing to a wallet that mixed his UTXOs. “Bitcoiners be warned: this is what happens if Binance finds you withdrawing to Wasabi wallet,” the Binance client tweeted. The customer dubbed @Bittlecat said he wasn’t surprised to find out his transactions were tracked, but stressed that he was very concerned that Binance knew he was sending to Wasabi. After telling the public about the incident, Bittlecat said that he got his BTC back. “I got my [satoshis] back, but not without promising Big Brother I wouldn’t mix those UTXOs,” he remarked. Bittlecat added:

It is really sad that [Coinjoin] is seen as criminal activity, and I’m glad that we are discussing this.

Bittlecat’s tweet, of course, quickly made its way across social media and crypto forums, becoming a viral topic in a matter of no time. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) replied to Bittlecat’s tweet and disclosed that the exchange operates under regulatory guidelines. “Binance SG operates under the requirements set forth by MAS and our MAS regulated partner, Xfers. Hence there are AML CFT controls set in place,” CZ responded. “Not something for us to decide [and] I believe they have already reached out to you to clarify and explain.” The Wasabi user reacted to CZ’s response and said that he expected the CEO to “decentralise the blame.” “How does this regulation make sense, when Binance has already KYC-ed me?” he asked. “Mixing is not illegal, it’s privacy.”

Governments Dislike Crypto Mixers and UTXO Tumblers

A great number of crypto proponents believe that issues like the Wasabi/Binance problem are just the start of a large uphill battle for privacy. Governments worldwide and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) are preparing to crack down on exchanges after FATF galvanized the fact that the “Travel” rule will certainly apply to cryptocurrencies. For years now, governments have targeted tools like BTC mixers and tumblers (Coinjoin-based) to fight against so-called money laundering and terrorist financing. For instance, in January 2017, a group of officials from Europol, Interpol, and the Basel Institute on Governance met in Doha, Qatar and discussed the topic of crypto mixers. During the two-day event, participants attending the anti-crime focused conference had a slew of recommendations including dismantling crypto tumbler services. The Basel Institute’s press statement insisted:

All countries are advised to take action against digital currency mixers/tumblers. Such services are designed exclusively to anonymize transactions and to make it impossible for law enforcement agencies to detect and trace suspicious transactions. The existence of such companies should not continue to be tolerated.

Since then, law enforcement officials have taken action against digital currency mixers. Furthermore, a few online mixing services on clearnet and the deep web decided to shut down services in fear of criminal charges. For instance, after the takedown of the two darknet marketplaces Alphabay and Hansa, the extremely popular Bitmixer.io voluntarily closed operations in July 2017. Two years later, in May, the operation Bestmixer.io was seized by Europol and the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD). At the time, Dutch authorities accused the Bestmixer administrators of mixing 27,000 BTC. A month later, in June 2019, the BTC tumbling service Bitcoin Blender voluntarily bowed out and closed its operations.

After a number of digital currency mixer/tumbler services bit the dust, cryptocurrency developers have created in-wallet platforms that allow users to mix UTXOs in a noncustodial fashion. For BTC, there are popular mixing wallets like Samourai and Wasabi wallet and bitcoin cash (BCH) users have access to Cashshuffle. Moreover, BCH developers are improving Cashshuffle with a protocol called Cashfusion. Additionally, as governments and regulators have threatened exchanges who don’t comply with AML/KYC guidelines, a myriad of trading platforms have delisted cryptos with privacy-centric characteristics like monero (XMR), and zcash (ZEC). Officials from Japan pressured Japanese exchanges to delist privacy coins and a number of other international exchanges have dropped digital currencies that provide anonymity.

FATF Rules Will Further Disrupt Privacy Advocates and the Anonymous Crypto Applications They Use

People believe exchanges delisting privacy coins, law enforcement agencies cracking down on mixers, and the recent issue with a Binance customer using Wasabi is just more signals of a FATF-driven agenda against cryptocurrencies. Individuals and organizations knew big changes were coming after the June G20 leaders’ summit ended in Japan. At the time, G20 participants including leaders from the EU, U.S., Germany, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., and India reaffirmed that the FATF rules would apply to the digital currency ecosystem. By this spring of 2020, the whole cryptocurrency environment may look entirely different due to the FATF regulations and of course anything to do with privacy, like using mixers like Wasabi, will be frowned upon.

But we’re not going to be able to do this without first peering into finance’s past!

Historically, every epochal change in trading has been accompanied by a combination of both business model innovation and technical improvements. These innovations included quantitative improvements to valuations, such as the use of the Black-Scholes equation for options pricing, and infrastructure for electronic markets that let new competitors (such as BATS) enter the marketplace.

The past 40 years of development have warped market structure and valuation models and the next 40 years look to be no different. In the 1980s and 1990s, electronic markets and novel valuation models helped propel options and futures trading to new heights. Cumulatively, this led to new forms of algorithmic trading and market making that made it easier for passive investing — and overall market participation — to increase in the 2000s and 2010s.

In crypto, we have slowly begun to see a similar combination of business model and technical improvements that are portents of the future — namely, exchange tokens and on-chain trading and lending. These portholes to the financial systems of the future are the bellwether for a new quantitative era of crypto trading.

Exchange Tokens: Business model innovation or regulatory arbitrage?

The crypto trading boom of 2017 led to exchanges and financially-savvy entrepreneurs realizing that futures and other derivatives products were the most profitable way to package crypto's inherent volatility for customers. This led to a flood of new crypto futures exchanges, all of which are competing for BitMEX's first-mover and liquidity advantages. What came out of this race to dethrone BitMEX was an amazing business model innovation that seems innocuous enough: the exchange token. Given that most other tokens lack utility and value accrual, it is natural to wonder why these tokens are special and accrue value. For this, it helps to get some context from how revenue is shared at traditional equities venues.

In these markets, exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) share revenue with market makers as a function of their pro-rata share of exchange volume. Why do they do this? Exchanges don't want to hold risk themselves — they want to collect a toll yet don’t want to do any maintenance — but they need to ensure that they have tight spreads (e.g. good prices) and meet regulatory requirements (e.g. Regulation Neutral Market Service, or RegNMS). These exchanges, do this via fee rebates — if you trade more than 10,000 shares per day and you normally pay 0.01% per share traded, then the venue gives you a discount to 0.005% — which are paid quarterly and/or infrequently.

On the other hand, exchange tokens, such as Binance’s BNB, FTX's FTT, CoinFLEX's FLEX, or Huobi's HT, are designed to provide more instantaneous rebates. How does this work?

Market makers are paid rebates in these tokens, continuously, which changes the relative supply of these tokens (e.g. new tokens are minted).

Exchanges infrequently burn a lot of these tokens, which implicitly makes these tokens more valuable and since market makers are already quoting these tokens (e.g. providing bid/ask spreads on FTT/USDT, for instance), they can effectively get paid ""continuous"" rebates.

Continuously paid rebates admit better capital optimization for market makers allowing them to Can reinvest their rebates into long positions (think of this as ‘reinvesting dividends’ but for market makers!) Take on more risk and leverage Quote tighter spreads



While the CME or NYSE could certainly provide this, they are reticent to do this as these tokens could easily be deemed securities by regulators. Subsequently, this is also why you're seeing these tokens boom in Asia and not the west — and they're successfully encouraging new market making participants to add liquidity to these exchanges in a way that existing exchanges cannot. Moreover, there's a feedback loop for these tokens, which is why you've seen the most successful competitors to BitMEX — Binance, FTX, Huobi, CoinFLEX — utilizing these tokens as tools to gain market share.

What can we learn from finance’s past?

This unbridled competition from exchanges resembles the heady early times of the equities markets in the late 1990s to early 2000s, when people were starting exchanges that were competitive with NYSE and NASDAQ out of their basements. At this time, the US equities market had extremely fragmented liquidity and poor data, with large data providers such as Yahoo! Finance and S&P sourcing from 100s of exchanges of varying quality, akin to CoinMarketCap. Regulators decided to improve liquidity and transparency by forcing the decentralized nature of equities exchanges to become more centralized via RegNMS.

The implementation of RegNMS in 2005 forced consolidation by requiring any stock exchange to provide the national best bid and offer (NBBO) over all other exchanges. This meant that exchanges that had very little volume would have to listen to exchanges with lots of volume and provide prices that match those high volume exchanges. Inevitably, this led to the shuttering of a number of smaller exchanges as they lost money while being forced to provide prices that deviated from their liquidity [0].

This boom and bust era of startup US equities exchanges ended with some of the biggest startup equities exchanges being acquired by existing exchanges and banks for billions of dollars [1]. A natural question to ask about exchange tokens is: what will the RegNMS moment of this world look like?

Automated Market Making: The RegNMS of Crypto?

Speaking of RegNMS, the decentralized yet almost synchronous nature of US equities markets is starting to rear its head in crypto via decentralized exchanges and on-chain trading.

In this world, traders are able to non-custodially trade with smart contracts instead of centralized entities, like Coinbase, Binance, or BitMEX. Until 2019, these exchanges were historically plagued by terrible UX, expensive fees (relative to centralized competitors), costly security bugs, and riddled with valueless fee tokens. The introduction of Uniswap and constant product market making led to a dramatic shift in usability, UX, and inevitably, fees, for users of these protocols. Uniswap, which was created with a $100,000 grant from the EF, has fared much better than competitors such as Bancor (which raised $153m in 2017) because it avoided historical mistakes with automated market makers and optimized for simplicity (which leads to smaller and less complicated fees).

Let’s step back for a second: What are automated market makers? These are methods for valuing assets without needing market makers and have existed in the academic literature since the early 2000s. They were often used in early prediction markets and tended to have poor usage due to complex UX or challenges (think: Lightning/L2 game theoretic challenges).

How do AMMs work? They incentivize participants to:

Lend their assets to a pool, from which they derive a pro-rata share of trading transaction fees. Market makers are replaced by these lenders which can earn passive income for lending their assets to the pool. One can even view the yield earned by lenders as equivalent to ‘revenue sharing with the exchange,’ which happens to be a smart contract.

Act as an ‘oracle’, synchronizing prices of off-chain exchanges with those on-chain (e.g. incentivizing arbitrageurs to keep the ETH/DAI price on Coinbase ‘close’ to the on-chain exchange) [1]

The simplicity of AMMs, which starts with the absence of an order book and incentives for those who contribute tokens to the pool to keep the prices tethered to Coinbase/Binance/etc., has led to a significant amount of liquidity in on-chain vehicles. Moreover, it is easy for those working on UIs for decentralized trading protocols to integrate with Uniswap. This is how, for instance, Synthetix, a decentralized margin trading contract (which is one of many attempts at making a decentralized BitMEX) was able to bootstrap liquidity for traders of synthetic tokens. Synthetix, whose native token increased in value to be one of the largest Uniswap assets, is exemplar of how the interconnected nature of on-chain trading venues allows for new use cases to bootstrap off of existing liquidity. What is driving this increase in trading activity on-chain? It is likely a combination of the following:

Increased KYC scrutiny (even, purportedly, at BitMEX, thanks to 5AMLD!)

The introduction of practical AMM designs that provide reasonable (but not perfect) passive income for token lenders while also encouraging arbitrageurs prices synchronized

Growth in on-chain lending (e.g. Compound) providing non-trivial leverage for traders

Increased number of exchange aggregators (e.g. 1inch, DEX.ag, 0x’s new design) has proven that market forces can synchronize prices across these pools (and lower fees!) without needing order books. This is quite an innovation, as synchronization in normal markets is relative to NBBO (national best bid and offer), which requires an order book. This is sort of like a decentralized, version of RegNMS, albeit with no KYC necessary.



How will these changes affect the future of crypto trading?

Given the 2019 emergence of these two financial tools in crypto, it is natural to ask, what’s next and how will these tools change trading in the next decade? I’ve decided to break this up into four sections: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Other Layer 1, and Valuation Models of the Future.

Bitcoin Lightning has always been the main form of on-chain lending activity on Bitcoin, with the lending corresponding to providing raw network value in terms of routing. I think that Lightning will make large strides in 2020, especially as exchanges such as Sparkswap and games such as Lightning Poker continue to have UX and usability improvements. Centralized exchange connectivity to Lightning, which began with Bitfinex’s announcement in December, will provide other arbitrage opportunities as Layer 2 cross-chain solutions will begin to have more intrinsic value (e.g. making Uniswap arbitrage opportunities more valuable). There are a number of projects looking to bring DeFi primitives to Bitcoin via sidechains, such as Echo and Money on Chain (built on RSK). This should provide ample opportunity for Bitcoiners who don’t want to go cross-chain to earn some yield. Cross-chain solutions, such as Cosmos and tBTC, will also help boost the amount of liquidity as traders can lend their tokens from one chain on another, without needed an external vendor like Genesis or Celsius.

Ethereum

As margin trading venues begin to roll out on Ethereum, including Monte Carlo DEX (which has Bitcoin synthetics with up to 5x leverage), UMA, and Synthetix, we’re likely to see a growth in these projects that aim to use novel revenue sharing agreements (exchange tokens, pooled fees, etc.) to minimize gas usage and optimize UX. Ethereum lending has been growing, mainly in support of trading, and the trends for increasing these lending pools (e.g. exchange/wallet support for Compound, better UX via Dharma, etc.) and the increased need for lent tokens for derivatives should have a flywheel effect (but let’s hope that it isn’t akin to the margin that was present during the 1929 stock market crash). Private Ethereum transactions, for instance via Aztec Protocol’s shielded ERC-20s, will open up different styles of trading as front-running becomes less profitable and more expensive. Regulation of front-ends will increase. For example, Uniswap currently restricts access to their front-end webapp to users from certain countries, even though the Uniswap smart contract is running on Ethereum blockchain and is available to anyone.

Other Layer 1s

A lot of protocols are going to launch with on-chain exchanges, such as Celo. These protocols need these exchanges for stability (e.g. stablecoins) and/or to provide validators with on-chain liquidity during the early stages of the network. These networks will need to build liquidity in lending pools like those on Ethereum to help bootstrap both sides of a trade. Cross-chain solutions will also help bootstrap liquidity on new chains from existing ones (e.g. BTC, ETH).

Valuation Models of the Future

As the on-chain trading world matures, so will the actuarial and quantitative tools and techniques used to analyze and secure these networks. Front-running is already common on most Ethereum trading venues and one should expect to see more sophisticated trading strategies that take advantage of low-level transaction data dominate the marketplace. (In a recent episode of Laura Shin’s Podcast, the creator of Synthetix notes that charging higher fees for switching from long/short in the same asset has helped reduce front running.) This is an exciting time! Big improvements to valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes equation, often come out of improvements to market infrastructure and I suspect that 2020 will bring an ever increasing tool chest to the valuation of crypto assets. But hey, I’m biased…



If there is nothing else that you take away from this article, just remember this: the next decade of crypto trading will look far different from the previous decade as business models and technology collectively advance. Happy New Year!

[0] The story is a bit more complicated, however: smaller exchanges do have an advantage with RegNMS in that they can compete with larger exchanges by incentivizing market-makers with rebates to provide tight spreads, forcing broker-dealers to route to them because of RegNMS. Ironically, RegNMS ended up fragmenting the market structure, leading to the formation of dark pools, each with slight twists on matching rules, order types, allowed participants, etc. Thanks to Rei Chiang and Leland Lee for further discussion about this point.

2019-12-28,"Prepaid cards are a simple and convenient way of paying for goods and services with the money you actually own.

It’s now possible to use prepaid cards to buy cryptocurrency at many of the major exchanges. The fees charged tend to be higher than for bank transfers, but there are several reasons why some people are turning to prepaid cards.

If you’re thinking of buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another digital currency with a prepaid card, read on to discover the steps you need to go through.

What is a prepaid card?

Prepaid cards, also known as everyday cards, work in a similar way to a pay-as-you-go mobile phone. You load them with cash when you first buy them and top them up when the cash starts to run out.

Unlike a credit card, a major advantage of a prepaid card is you can’t run up debts on them. They only allow you to buy goods or services with the money you actually own. This makes them a useful budgeting tool and it means you don’t have to go through a credit checking process when you apply for one.

Another benefit of not having a credit facility is that if you fall victim to a scam, your losses are limited to the amount of money on your card.

Prepaid cards that have the MasterCard or Visa logo on them can be used anywhere that accepts these card scheme networks.

Why use a prepaid card to buy crypto?

A bank transfer is generally considered the best way to buy crypto because the fees are cheaper and it carries less risk than paying by card. For some people, however, paying by card is an easier and more convenient option.

Using a card enables you to buy crypto instantly, whereas with a bank transfer it can take around three to five days for the crypto to reach your account.

Many crypto exchanges accept traditional debit and credit card payments, but these have their drawbacks. Buying cryptocurrency with a credit card is an especially risky strategy.

According to a survey by LendEDU, more than a fifth of investors who used a credit card to buy Bitcoin didn’t pay off their purchases straight away.

Planning to use profits from Bitcoin – or any other cryptocurrency – to pay off a card balance is risky because there is a high chance the value of Bitcoin will plummet.

Equally, many banks offer overdraft facilities alongside debit cards, which means you can essentially use them like a credit card by borrowing from the bank.

A prepaid card enables you to buy crypto with a card but without the risk of spending more money than you have and being unable to pay it back.

How to use a prepaid card to buy crypto

There are lots of cryptocurrency exchanges that enable you to buy crypto with a prepaid card.

The process is pretty much the same as buying crypto with a debit or credit card – you just need to make sure you’ve loaded your prepaid card with sufficient funds.

When you’re comparing exchanges, one of the main things to look out for is how much they charge for card purchases. Fees are typically between 4% and 5%, whereas with a bank transfer, the fee could be less than 1%.

Once you’ve selected an exchange, the first step is to download and install a wallet that supports your chosen cryptocurrency.

You’ll then need to register for an account at the exchange – a process which will most likely include providing ID documents to prove it is you.

Once you’re registered, you can select your preferred payment method option – in this case credit/debit card – and add your prepaid card. It’s worth noting that some exchanges don’t support cards without an associated billing address.

When your card is added, you can then buy your chosen coins using the cash on your prepaid card. It’s important to withdraw your crypto and transfer it to your digital wallet to keep it safe and secure.

Conclusion

Using a prepaid card isn’t the cheapest way of buying cryptocurrency, but it’s an appealing option for those seeking a fast, simple, and convenient method of making purchases without spending more money than you own.","Share this article

In theory, it should be easy to choose a cryptocurrency sign. Countless fiat currencies have popularized a single style — a letter with one or several strike-through bars, which should represent the stability of the currency. It’s a design that has been used all around the world: signs for the euro, the pound, the yen, the franc, and the dollar can all be instantly recognized by almost anyone.

Yet it’s not so easy to follow that style in the cryptocurrency world. Hundreds of different crypto projects are competing over similar identities, which led many parts of the industry to overlook all but the most popular symbols. Nevertheless, many crypto projects are pushing for recognition with various strategies — here’s who they are.

Bitcoin Borrowed a Currency Sign

Bitcoin’s ₿ symbol is undeniably the most recognizable crypto sign. It’s an original design that has been part of Bitcoin’s logo since 2010, and it was finally added to Unicode in 2016. This made it easier for users to type (or copy and paste) the character.

Naturally, ₿ is used by exchanges and market aggregators, but it has been integrated with mainstream software as well. The sign has been added to Microsoft Excel and Google’s iOS Keyboard. These additions may seem trivial, but they are a sign of growing recognition.

However, the road to a standard symbol was a long one. Until recently, Bitcoin used the Thai baht symbol (฿) as its currency sign. This didn’t cause a lot of confusion, given that Bitcoin-to-baht conversions are rare. In fact, the old symbol is still in use today on many minor websites, such as Bittybot, Predictious, and LikeForex.

Other projects that have borrowed real-world currency symbols handle the problem in creative ways. Tether uses Mongolia’s togrog sign (₮), but combines it with a currency code, as in USD₮. Cardano, meanwhile, uses Argentina’s austral sign (₳), which is not much of an issue — the original currency has been defunct for two decades.

Litecoin Uses a Faux Currency Sign

There are easier ways to avoid overlap. Plenty of characters look very similar to currency signs, even though they have never actually been used in that way. Litecoin, for example, has laid claim to Ł, a letter found in Polish and West Slavic alphabets.

Since Litecoin is less popular than Bitcoin, the Ł symbol is not quite as widely used. Most sites simply use the ticker symbol LTC to represent Litecoin amounts. However, a few sites use the Ł character on their market pages, including the market aggregator CryptoCompare.

Other coins have managed to find similar symbols. Lisk uses Ⱡ, Dogecoin uses Ð, and Reddcoin uses Ɍ. Hedera Hashgraph uses ℏ for its coin, HBAR, and some Bitcoin users employ Ƀ as an alternative to the baht symbol. None of these symbols have any currency-related uses outside of crypto, so this is a sensible and clear approach.

Ethereum Uses a Strokeless Symbol

Ethereum has used Ξ as its sign since 2014. The symbol is actually the Greek letter Xi, but it plainly resembles a stylized E, making it an obvious choice for Ethereum. It’s also notable for its “strokeless” design, which breaks from the standard set by world currencies.

Though it is not exactly mainstream, the Ξ symbol is used fairly often in the Ethereum ecosystem. The market aggregator CoinGecko, the collectibles marketplace OpenSea, and the DApp directory DAppReview are among the many websites that use Ξ to represent Ether amounts.

Other currencies use strokeless symbols as well. Monero uses ɱ, Tezos uses ꜩ, and Zcash uses ⓩ. Though these symbols are appealing and stylized, observers from outside the crypto world may not instinctively recognize them as currency signs — something that critics have previously warned of in discussions of alternative Ethereum symbols.

Stellar Has an Original Design

Some cryptocurrencies are taking their symbols in fresh directions. Stellar designed its own currency sign last year, which is reminiscent of the dollar sign and the rings of Saturn. Or, as Stellar describes it, it is “planetary, not to mention coin-like.”

Unfortunately, the symbol is not widely used outside of Stellar’s own website, marketing materials, and merchandise. Since the symbol does not yet have a corresponding Unicode character, it cannot be displayed as text. Sites that want to use the symbol must rely on an image, which is not always practical.

Despite the drawbacks, other coins have attempted original designs as well. MakerDAO introduced a new Dai symbol as part of a recent upgrade, and the XRP community has two competing symbols on the table. It may be difficult for these projects to standardize their signs, but when they do, they should have very strong brand identities.

What Does It Take to Succeed?

It’s hard to quantify what is the impact of various design styles on popularity. Cryptocurrency symbols that are shown prominently on a few major websites may not be widely used by individuals on a daily basis. On the flip side, charged debates between passionate individuals do not guarantee that exchanges and market aggregators will recognize a symbol.

However, a few factors seem to be important. Projects generally seek out symbols that are clearly currency-related, designs that resemble an existing logo, and characters that are already found within Unicode. Most of these things are true whether a symbol is chosen by a community, by developers, or designed by an outside contractor.

Though each cryptocurrency project puts a lot of thought into its decisions, practical matters should not be ignored. High-ranking and long-established coins tend to be more successful all around. Naturally, successful coins usually have more recognizable signs by default — regardless of the reasoning that led to that point.","The impact of 2020’s economic and political events could have a lasting effect on the future of crypto assets, although it is unclear what the final result may be.

Most people are likely aware of the massive potential impact that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can have on countless industries. Their ability to revolutionize the world is even recognized by those who do not want them to progress, albeit unwillingly.

However, it is also important to remember that this revolution is a ‘double-edged sword’ and can also counter-impact the current state of crypto assets.

With the new year just around the corner, it is worth considering how political and economic events might impact digital currencies.

A Quick Look Back on 2019

When 2019 was about to arrive, many expected it to be a year of big breakthroughs. While it is true that some very important milestones were reached, and significant accomplishments were achieved — the impact of political and economic events did not help the crypto world as much as some people had hoped it would.

The global economy was harsh, Brexit was a very hot topic this year, and the US/China trade war was raging for the better part of the year. Still, equity markets managed to regain a lot of the value that was lost, and traditional assets saw an increase in investment activity. Even so, there was a considerable impact on the global economy, which experienced a significant slowdown this year, mostly due to the situation between China and the US.

The final result? Crypto assets became stronger than in 2018.

What to Expect From Crypto in 2020?

So far, everything regarding 2020 and the following years remains speculation, but it is likely that interest rates will remain low as the new year kicks off. In other words, investors will likely continue looking for better earning opportunities outside of deposits. This might represent an opportunity for virtual currencies.

As noticed by Glen Goodman, Bitcoin is not making as many titles as it used to, but blockchain continues to get adopted by companies, only silently, in the background, which is setting the stage for crypto.

Meanwhile, Wells Fargo Bank’s economist, Eugenio Aleman, believes that the recession of the world’s largest economy — the US — remains a possibility. This, alongside the UN’s warning of a global recession, may lead to an even bigger economic slowdown, and push people deeper into the crypto space.

Next, while Brexit did not happen in 2019, it may still occur in 2020. A lot of it remains uncertain, which is leaving a lot of options open. It is also unclear what will happen with trade wars and military tensions, although many expect them to remain a large problem to be dealt with in 2020.

The US is in conflict with China, North Korea, Iran, and others. While armed conflicts with any of these countries remain highly unlikely, the economic conflicts are to be expected, and this could also push people towards crypto.

At the same time, national banks are developing an interest in crypto, particularly in CBDCs, led by China, Turkey, and France. Russia is doing tests with stablecoins, and many others are likely to follow. All in all, it will be an unpredictable decade, with potential major changes that people will have to get used to and learn to live with.

2019-12-29,"Whenever a year comes to its end, people start reminiscing on the last 365 days, recovering photos and memories, and the same could be expected to happen in the next few days, as this year ends.

2019 though, marks another milestone as the whole decade is coming to a close. While some people might start getting back to what happened to them in the last ten years, we will have a look at the leading financial instruments and how they performed in this timeframe.

Did you know that if you had invested $1 in a specific stock in 2010, it could have turned it to $4,177 as of now? While this sounds incredibly impressive, there’s another type of investment that would have turned your $1 in 2010 to a mind-blowing $90,000. The name of that investment, you ask – yes, Bitcoin.

The Investment Rule of Thumb

Let’s begin by explaining what actually an investment is and what’s the point of investing. Economically speaking, to invest would mean to purchase goods that are not consumed today but are considered to increase their value in the future. In other words, to put away money now into an investment asset, with the goal being the same – increase value and income in time.

As the world has progressed over the last century, there are numerous types of different investment opportunities available today. Such can be the traditional stock market, bonds, mutual funds, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), certificates of deposits, options, annuities, real estate, commodities, art, and of course, cryptocurrencies. We will focus now on the first and the last of these examples and the returns they have provided over the previous ten years.

NetFlix Marks The Biggest ROIs of The S&P 500

According to a recent report, out of all 500 companies that combine the S&P index, the most notable gainer in the stock market over the last ten years has been Netflix. One of the largest worldwide streaming platforms has recorded a fantastic growth of 4,181%. Here comes the $1 example from above – if invested in 2010, this small amount would have been worth over $41 today.

Netflix’s stock price was less than $8 when 2010 began, reached an all-time high in June last year of over $420, and is currently trading around $330.

The company’s organic growth is equally impressing, as well. At the same time, it went from sending physical DVDs and having 12 million U.S.-based subscribers, to full online streaming platform, over $150 M subs from around the world, and even producing its TV shows and movies.

In a world where the popular stock market index, S&P 500, combining the 500 best-performing stocks in the U.S. has surged with 189% in the last ten years, other well-known companies are delivering more considerable results.

Stock returns in past decade: Netflix: +4,177%

Amazon: +1,787%

Mastercard: +1,126%

Apple: +966%

Visa: +824%

Starbucks: +800%

Salesforce: +792%

Bitcoin Reigns Supreme

This past decade also saw the emergence of digital assets known as cryptocurrencies. The first-ever of its kind was Bitcoin, and if we compare its return-on-investment (ROI) with Netflix (or any other type of investment), it beats them. Actually, that’s an understatement.

It’s usually hard to argue with math, especially when the numbers are so adequately provided, as they are in this report. It says that you were among the few people lucky enough to know and to believe in Bitcoin back in 2010 and you had invested the same amount, the return you would have today is, well, more than $41. Substantially more. Emphatically more. $1 invested back then would be worth more than $90,000, representing a 8,900,000% ROI in ten years.

Given the fact that Bitcoin price was around $0,07 at the time and is currently trading at $7,300 – it’s easy to see where that ROI comes from.

Of course, like any investment, there is the aspect of risk to reward: As the risk was a lot higher investing in Bitcoin than in Netflix, the reward potential from investing in Bitcoin should be much higher, and indeed is.

Bitcoin’s Evolution

The largest cryptocurrency had a quiet start late last decade but has gone a long way since then. Its history is filled with exciting events, from the anonymous pseudonym behind Bitcoin’s creation by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, comparison to Gold, parabolic price increases, media attention, and so forth.

Fundamentally speaking, the network has become much more secure throughout the years. For instance, the work that miners need to do to generate the enormous amount of numbers required to come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number is represented by Bitcoin’s hash rate. As Cryptopotato reported recently, it recorded a new all-time high, resulting in increased security levels.

One of the significant negative points that non-believers bring to the table is the lack of regulations. However, this year the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) released a Bitcoin Futures trading platform called Bakkt. Its purpose is to serve as a gateway for institutional investors to enter the BTC market because of its regulated warehousing. The company received a license from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to hold users’ funds.

Other news comes from Bitcoin’s scalability solution project – the Lightning Network. Its capacity keeps rising to over 860 BTC at the moment.

The largest cryptocurrency has also been widely compared to gold due to some similarities. For once, both are scarce assets, having only a limited supply to ever be in existence. Even though we don’t know exactly how much is that for gold, we know that the maximum amount of bitcoins to ever be in circulation is 21 million.

To support this comparison came the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which officially named Bitcoin as a commodity – the same category as gold. It’s worth noting that the report above states that $1 put in gold in 2010 would have resulted in $1.38, which is again a significantly lower ROI than BTC’s.

Bitcoin’s Drawbacks

Like all things in life, nothing is perfect. Bitcoin has its fair share of non-believers who are often bringing up several potential drawbacks, such as volatility and being used in illegal activities.

The volatility is a significant factor in the cryptocurrency market, and it has been proven lots of times. Arguably the most notable one came in late 2017 and early 2018 when BTC price, for example, recorded its all-time high at nearly $20,000. This brought severe media attention, and a lot more people joined in, trying to catch the wave.

However, with so much speculation, came the inevitable crash. The largest crypto plunged to $3,700 at the end of 2018 – an 82% drop in a year. Needless to say, the non-believers appeared quite satisfied with this outcome, and many of them rushed to declare Bitcoin as dead (again) – wrongfully.

Bitcoin and altcoins are often brought to light when it comes down to illegal financial activities. Due to their mostly anonymous nature, some people assume that they are mostly used for such transactions.

However, a recent report showed that only 0.2% of all transactions handled by the third-largest cryptocurrency, Ripple (XRP), could be linked to illegal activities. Moreover, it also shows than 0.5% of all BTC’s transactions have the same illicit nature. The report goes even further by concluding that cash is still the most preferred method for illegal fundings.

Conclusion

The last decade has been quite a turbulent one, especially within the financial markets. The cryptocurrency emergence might have disrupted some traditional forms of investments, especially when we compare stats from the past ten years. While there are several stocks with high returns, Bitcoin is outperforming all of them by a country mile. In its relatively short existence, the largest crypto has noted numerous improvements in its usage and security, raising the question of what is to come and how it will affect our investments and entire lives.","Market Update: Crypto Traders Search for Bullish and Bearish Trends

During the last few days, digital currency markets have been meandering sideways and prices have been less volatile. On Sunday, during the last 24 hours, the entire cryptoconomy is hovering just below the $200 billion zone and there’s roughly $71 billion in global trades. Crypto proponents are still uncertain about the future trajectory and whether or not digital currency price trends will continue sliding or rise again.

The Cryptoconomy Continues to Meander Sideways

Digital currency markets on Dec. 29, have seen a bunch of cryptos gather a few gains during the 24 hours of trading. Currently, the top 10 crypto market capitalizations have seen percentage increases between 0.50% to 5%. At the moment, BTC prices are around $7,392 which is up 1.05% for the day. BTC has an overall market valuation of around $134 billion and roughly $21 billion in 24-hour trade volume. Out of all the coin caps, BTC’s $134 billion market cap is dominating by 68%, but 74% of all BTC trades this Sunday is in tether (USDT).

Ethereum (ETH) is swapping for $130 per coin and ETH markets are up 2.3% during today’s trading sessions. This is followed by ripple (XRP) markets which have seen a 1.2% gain today and each XRP is trading for $0.19. The fourth-largest market valuation belongs to the stablecoin tether (USDT) and USDT is capturing around two-thirds of every crypto trade on Sunday. On Dec. 29, USDT trade volume is the highest out of all the coins with $25 billion worth of global swaps.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH/USD) Market Action

Bitcoin cash (BCH) markets are up 2.6% today and 13.4% during the last seven days of trading. Each BCH is swapping for $212 per coin and BCH has a market valuation of around $3.87 billion. At the time of publication, there is $1.7 billion worth of bitcoin cash being traded on exchanges and USDT captures 53% of all BCH trades. This is followed by BTC (23.29%), USD (13.06%), USDK (4.14%), ETH (3.52%), and KRW (1.32%). Looking at the weekly and daily BCH charts, Fxstreet analyst Ken Chigbo explained on Dec. 27 that BCH/USD is set to test the big $200 barrier.

“Weekly price action smashed through the $200 mark, a retest is being observed in the current week, however, so far only resulting in rejection,” Chigbo said. “Price action is resting a breached daily pennant structure, a break and closure above would be critical for the bulls,” the analyst added.

Gold Bug Peter Schiff Doesn’t See Bitcoin Gains

On Dec. 27, the notorious gold bug Peter Schiff said that BTC is the only asset in the world right now that’s not rallying toward the end of the year. “Bitcoin is not disappointing those who claim its true value is that it’s a non-correlated asset,” Schiff tweeted. “Every asset class in the world is rallying into the end of the year except Bitcoin. Not sure what value this actually adds, but at least Bitcoin is meeting expectations on something,” the economist further remarked. Despite Schiff’s opinion, the digital asset climbed more than 8.9 million percent over the last 10 years compared to gold’s 38% climb. Moreover, the cryptocurrency was still the best performing asset in 2019 as well, even though prices have dropped.

Do Bearish Prices Equal an Upcoming Rip Your Face Off Rally?

Even though prices have been lagging, bitcoiners and crypto proponents believe markets will spike in the near future. Bitcoin trader Michaël van de Poppe thinks a deeper bottom is coming and a much larger rally will follow after. “Very simple, 2020 is going to be a great year for cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin,” the trader tweeted. “If market capitalization remains above $145-150 billion, I won’t be surprised we’ll see a rally towards $500-600 billion.”

In addition to this prediction, the prominent BTC commentator Hodlonaut can envision a face-melting rally. “The kind of sentiment doldrums we are in now [and] people seemingly accepting that 7k is fair value,” Hodlonaut wrote. “Dozens of bull narratives proven wrong — Fatigue high, hype low. [It] is exactly the type of place where it would be trademark Bitcoin character to start a rip your face off rally,” he added.

Overall, most traders and crypto enthusiasts are still uncertain as to where the future will take cryptocurrencies in the short term. Long term optimism is still high, but a decent number of analysts and traders think the bearish sentiment is not over. BTC/USD long positions (people betting the price will rise) have dipped a touch but are still extremely high compared to normal. Meanwhile, BTC/USD short positions (people betting against the price) are very low and there doesn’t seem to be many traders willing to short right now.

Soon after Google-owned Youtube has swung the strikes hammer against video content creators that talked about cryptocurrency-related topics, another arm of the search monopoly has taken down a popular ethereum dapps client.

Metamask Kicked out of Google Play Store

Google Play, the official app store for the Android operating system which is used by billions of mobile devices around the world and operated by Google, has banned the crypto app Metamask. The company pointed its restricted content policy on apps that expose users to deceptive or harmful financial products and services as a reason for the ban. The policy details that “we don’t allow apps that mine cryptocurrency on devices,” despite the fact that mining is something Metamask is not designed to do.

“If left banned, we will be working on other ways of bringing our services to users still stranded on the Android platform while they migrate to something more free,” the Metamask team stated on Twitter. “The story will not stop here, and it certainly won’t stop with the Goliath winning.”

In the last week, the MetaMask Android client was suspended by the Google Play App Store @googleplaydev. They cited their policy that bans mining on mobile, which we don’t. Appeal rejected. #ProtectWeb3.https://t.co/rfP4EbOAqv!?zippy_activeEl=cryptocurrencies%23cryptocurrencies — MetaMask (@metamask_io) December 26, 2019

Metamask is a decentralized apps browser for desktop and mobile built upon the Ethereum network. It also offers browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave that add an in-browser wallet for ETH and ERC20 tokens to be sent and received. If you are using Android using an extension with one the supported browsers is a way to access the Metamask service until another solution in found.

Crypto Community Turns Against Data Monopoly

The move to ban Metamask from the Play Store comes at an especially tense time between Google and the crypto community. This is because only recently the google-owned video sharing website Youtube has removed content and banned channels that promote or otherwise analyze the digital asset markets. The company has since claimed this was done by mistake and reinstated some channels but the risk it poses to the ability to spread news ideas have already become clear.

The Youtube affair drove many in the crypto community to look for ways to back up their content or even migrate to alternative platforms, with some influencers suggesting there is a need to develop new decentralized and censorship-resistant platforms for video sharing. If more crypto apps will be blocked perhaps there will be a similar move to diversify away from Android with a new crypto friendly and open operating system for mobile devices. Depending on a tech giant like Google that monopolizes search, email, video sharing and other fields could be a major problem for any technology that aims to change the world.

Square, the financial technology company led by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, began offering users the ability to buy and sell bitcoin in November 2017. Still, the feature is limited compared to offerings by crypto-native firms like Coinbase.

Change is soon coming, however. As per a job ad, which has not been previously reported on, Square has been accepting applications for a PM to add new possible features including ""auto-investing"" and peer-to-peer ""BTC gifting.""

""You will own the Crypto Investing product and be entirely responsible for growing its adoption in whatever ways you see fit, which could include tried and true growth tactics, new functionality (e.g. limit orders, auto-invest), or building entirely new features like BTC gifting (P2P),"" the job description states.

Square's bitcoin offering has witnessed steady growth in 2019, as previously noted by The Block's Ryan Todd.

Square posted a record $148 million in quarterly bitcoin sales for the third quarter of 2019, up ~20% on volumes from last quarter, and up more than 245% since Q3 2018. In terms of BTC, The Block estimates that the total volume of BTC sales through the Cash App was ~14,300 BTC, using the average price of bitcoin in Q3 ($10.3K).

In the company's third quarter investor letter, the firm credited Cash App's redesigned customer interface in September for increased product adoption of both Bitcoin and Cash Card. Square also noted that first-time bitcoin buyers have ""approximately doubled"" since the redesign.","You Can Now Buy Cryptocurrency With Credit Card on Bitcoin.com Exchange

An investigation launched on the request of a French startup has led to the indictment of a 37-year-old entrepreneur accused of stealing 182 BTC from the company he cofounded. Embezzlement of money is one the charges brought against him by the public prosecutor’s office in Paris.

Another Case Affirms the Money Status of Cryptocurrencies

Most European governments are yet to legalize and regulate cryptocurrencies. The process is starting to take shape and form with the implementation of the FATF standards and the transposition of EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) into national legislations. Laws that go beyond pure AML rules are also likely to be adopted and some crypto-friendly jurisdictions have already done that.

In the meantime, real life events are forcing authorities to deal with the phenomenon and acknowledge some of its basic characteristics. ‘Moneyness’ is one of the features of decentralized digital currencies that institutions are generally unwilling to recognize. But when coins are subject to a crime, that suddenly changes for some reason, as a recent ruling by Russia’s Supreme Court showed.

In a similar context, a case in France now provides another confirmation that cryptocurrencies can be viewed as money even without specific regulations stating so. A businessman involved in the case has been accused of funds embezzlement and money laundering along with unauthorized entry into an automated data processing system and criminal manipulation of the data.

Entrepreneur Snatches 182 Bitcoins From His Former Company

The investigation was launched on a request from the digital technologies startup, which he helped launch in 2013. It was a pretty successful endeavor for the electronics specialist until a conflict broke out over differences regarding the development strategy. He was eventually fired from his position at the company and decided to leave the country in search for better opportunities.

The man’s former partners allege that acting from abroad he managed to steal 182 BTC, or around €1.2 million at the time of writing. According to the Le Parisien newspaper, which covered the story, that’s the third-largest crypto theft in the history of France so far. The misappropriation of funds took place between December 2018 and January this year, Russian media reported.

According to the publication, the tech expert knew the company’s electronic system very well and was able to penetrate it without being detected. He also withdrew the money in multiple transactions making sure each one was smaller than the limit that would automatically trigger a security alert. It took the cybercrime unit of the Paris prosecutor’s office several months to identify the wallet the cryptocurrency was transferred to and link it to the suspect.

The man was detained on Dec. 22 in the French department of Calvados upon his return to the country. Despite the prosecutors’ request for a permanent arrest, the accused has been released by court authorities and placed only under “strict judicial supervision.”

Ultimately, the world lacks a clean balance sheet and an asset that has significant appreciation potential to create more loans against it. ​Euro-backed stablecoins can help boost the crypto-lending sector by providing new ways to put both digital assets and fiat to work.

Crypto lending works similarly to traditional lending services, the core difference being that loans are issued on decentralized platforms that lock up cryptocurrencies via smart contracts deployed on public blockchains.

And while the up-and-coming decentralized finance sector has grown, with $452 million in funds locked up in smart contracts — a 200% year-on-year increase — the industry has the potential to reach higher adoption levels.

The remaining point of friction? Most crypto lending options incur high losses when exchanging between crypto and fiat currencies.

The rising opportunity

A euro-backed stablecoin can provide much more value for a crypto-enabled financial system, and to understand why, it’s important to first consider the role that Europe and the euro play in the global financial system.

Global debt markets overexploit the assets they derive from. The world’s largest asset classes are the ​global stock market, worth $85 trillion, and ​residential real estate​, worth $217 trillion​. Yet, global debt sits at $244 trillion, increasing the debt-to-asset ratio to 80%. This indicates t​hat the world’s balance sheet is practically living off leverage.

In comparison, the cryptocurrency market has about ​$200 billion in assets with a debt-to-asset ratio of 2%, indicating a massive upward potential for a crypto-collateralized lending industry without necessarily having the same debt-to-asset balance sheet mismatch as traditional lending. With the crypto lending industry relying heavily on overcollateralization, lenders can only issue debt on a fraction of collateralized assets.

Euro stablecoins: A viable option for crypto lending

Until the crypto lending sector takes a considered approach to minimize price volatility between the value of fiat and cryptocurrencies, lenders and borrowers are faced with significant risks.

We can’t forget that the smart contracts that power crypto loans are self-executing lines of code. Securing a loan would involve sending cryptocurrencies to a smart contract escrow on the blockchain that will only release the collateral when the debt is repaid.

This means that movements in the value of a cryptocurrency in relation to a fiat’s value could trigger the smart contract to liquidate a loan.

In theory, stablecoins would be the best-fitting solution, as they are pegged to the value of existing fiat currencies. However, when looking at stablecoins pegged to the United States dollar, it quickly becomes apparent that they represent a limited solution that only serves a landlocked market. As other stablecoins continue to emerge, the market share of dollar-backed stablecoins will inevitably rebalance down.

The best candidate for an alternative to dollar-backed stablecoins is one backed by the euro, for a number of key reasons.

When we take a look at the stability of the traditional markets, the Eurozone has a strong economy comparable to the U.S. by population size, GDP and worldwide trade. Its current account balance is positive, at 1.18% of GDP as compared to -2.40% of GDP in the U.S., and the fiscal deficit of the former is 7.0x lower than that of the latter. Overall, the euro looks more stable over the dollar as an underlying asset for both stablecoins and crypto lending.

The amount of people involved in cryptocurrencies in the EU is also comparable to the U.S.: ​9% of Europeans own crypto (67 million people) compared to ​8% of Americans (26 million people), according to CCN data. Yet, holders are forced to settle in dollars when selling cryptocurrencies, which is more expensive and carries significant FX risks. The EU market is totally underpenetrated at the moment and is rising from a low base. Non-U.S. citizens must also oblige to U.S. regulations when holding dollars, even if it is only transitory. Euro-backed stablecoins represent the reporting currency of crypto holders in Europe, and as such, mitigate all the risks and inefficiencies related to U.S. dollars.

Lastly, the euro has a killer advantage for borrowers holding crypto — the negative interest rate yield. So far, there are no crypto lending platforms that understand how to capitalize on this advantage. If used right, it can reduce current crypto borrowing rates by at least 3% and still offer an attractive euro-pegged deposit yield, as the latter is practically non-existent, at 0.0–0.3% per annum.

Capitalizing on crypto lending leverage

What’s surprising is that to this day, financial institutions do not have the ability to lend fiat currency against cryptocurrency. This is a major opportunity loss when considering the growing crypto asset class.

To take advantage of the opportunities around crypto lending with a euro-backed stablecoin, a platform would need to consider the infrastructure needed for it to succeed. This includes on- and off-ramps or instant fiat settlements as well as an already established and adopted euro-backed stablecoin with meaningful liquidity.

It is also important that an issuer accounts for counterparties who can accept a euro-backed stablecoin. For instance, having a connection with cashout points, Visa or Mastercard would allow users to instantly spend or withdraw cash in their day-to-day lives. Corporate settlement projects are another important consideration that will help with managing balance sheets between decentralized finance applications and traditional institutions.

But what about price volatility? To a certain extent, volatility that matches real-world markets can be a real positive for a crypto lending platform, which may capitalize wh​en liquidations are triggered.

As a fiat derivative, euro-backed stablecoins could make a currency truly borderless and more global than ever. Individuals all over the world could gain exposure and synthetic access to the benefits of the euro, which has been largely limited so far to people within Europe.

It is also worth re-emphasising that crypto trades are not limited to markets and timezones. Bonds don’t always trade every day and equities don’t trade on weekends or nights. In comparison, illiquid assets like real estate, which is typically only traded every one to five years, can be given new life.

With the crypto lending market growing at an astounding rate, it is guaranteed to disrupt the traditional finance sector even further. But for it to make a meaningful and long-lasting impact, a real stability of the underlying asset is a must. Fiat-backed stablecoins might just be the right solution. Among the hundreds of announced projects, EURS is the only game-changer that is crafted with regulations and still working successfully.

2019-12-30,"Mike Novogratz. Source: A YouTube video screenshot

Former Goldman Sachs partner turned crypto investor Mike Novogratz believes that Bitcoin (BTC) will finish 2020 above the USD 12,000 mark. However, his previous predictions show how unpredictable the crypto market is.

Though he didn’t explain the reasoning behind this particular BTC prediction, this isn’t the first time Novogratz expressed his opinion on it.

For example, in the end of July 2019, he thought it could go up to USD 20,000 by the end of the year, pushed upwards by the merchant and consumer adoption, as well as experiments such as Telegram’s TON network and Gram token, or Facebook’s Libra. As more institutional investors come in, it’ll “kind of clean the image of the crypto space,” with bad actors being pushed out.

Since this prediction was made, BTC dropped by c. 25% and now trades below USD 7,500.

In October this year, Novogratz said that USD 6,500 could be the next downside for the world’s most popular coin, but that its future is on an ascending path afterwards, particularly after it breaks USD 8,200, as it’d return to USD 8,000 or USD 10,000 range. “It’s gonna need new energy to really make the big move,” the CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. said in this interview.

In August 2019, to the question if BTC could go below USD 5,000 the investor replied: “I don’t think so. I think if it goes below USD 8,500 I'll get nervous. If it goes below USD 6,000 I'll get real nervous.” Since August, Novogratz had multiple opportunities to get nervous, as BTC traded below USD 8,500 longer than above this line. The price is also well below USD 8,000 for more than a month now. However, it didn't drop below USD 6,000. In August, Novogratz also said that 2%-3% of each person’s net worth should be in crypto and that he owns more in BTC than in gold.

In the end of May of this year, when BTC jumped above USD 8,000 for the first time since July 2018, the investor estimated that bitcoin ""probably consolidates somewhere between USD 7,000 and USD 10,000"" as ""trees don’t grow to the sky.”

“If I’m wrong on that, I think I’m wrong to the upside, that there’s enough excitement and momentum that it could carry through,” he said, adding that greater adoption of crypto and blockchain and their acceptance by established Wall Street and technology companies had led to the 2019 rally. To get to the USD 20,000 he once predicted, institutions need to see crypto as a safer space, and Novogratz urged crypto exchanges to ""self-regulate"" in order to boost both their security and confidence in BTC.

In June, BTC peaked above USD 13,000 and has been gradually declining since then.

Meanwhile, in November 2018, when BTC changed hands at c. USD 4,000, Novogratz was guessing that bitcoin will remain in the USD 3,000-USD 6,000 range until institutional buyers step in. Earlier in October, he confirmed his prediction that BTC will stay below USD 10,000 for the rest of the year and the market rally might start in late first quarter or early second quarter as institutional investors will enter the market then.

The big rally of 2019 started in the beginning of April, when BTC was already above USD 4,000.

In October of 2018, when his firm lost millions, Novogratz was convinced that the crypto winter will end. “One thing I’ve learned in this process is everything takes a little bit longer than you hope it does,” he said, adding that the crypto ecosystem is a 4th-grader that we want to be a high school graduate tomorrow with a PhD the next day.

His predictions in November 2017 were less accurate.

In the end of the month (BTC was already above USD 9,000 back then), Novogratz said that the price could reach USD 40,000 by the end of 2018, with the total crypto market capitalization going to USD 2 trillion.

“There’s a big wave of money coming, not just here but all around the world,” said Novogratz, and demand from Asia cold push BTC’s price up too.

BTC ended 2018 below USD 4,000, while the total market capitalization stood at c. USD 125 billion.

Just a week earlier in November 2018, he predicted BTC reaching USD 10,000 by the end of the year.

In December, the price touched USD 20,000 and dropped below USD 14,000 on the last day of 2017.

Meanwhile, this past weekend Novogratz also jokingly agreed to a bet with 1 Ethereum (ETH) at stake, that Donald Trump will not be elected for his second term as the U.S. president.

At pixel time (12:18 AM UTC), BTC trades at c. USD 7,336 and is almost unchanged in the past 24 hours. The price is down by 3% in a week and by 5% in month, trimming its annual gains to less than 88%.","South Korea’s National Tax Service (NTS) will withhold tax worth 80.3 billion won, or $70 million, from the country’s largest crypto exchange Bithumb.

CoinDesk Korea reported Sunday that Vidente, the largest shareholder of Bithumb Holdings, which runs Bithumb Korea, confirmed the withheld amount in a notice and said the tax will be imposed on its foreign customers. However, that may not actually happen.

This is the first time the country’s taxation agency has imposed tax on gains from cryptocurrency transactions, the report said.

“Bithumb Korea is planning to take legal action against the tax claim so the final payment can be adjusted in the future,” the notice said, according to a report by Korea JoongAng Daily on Monday.

The amount of tax was calculated based on the rate for miscellaneous income, i.e. irregular income like lottery gains, Korea Joongang Daily wrote. The tax is collected at an annualized rate of 22 percent, based on the amount of foreign withdrawals from Bithumb.

It’s unclear what consequences the action will have for Bithumb’s clients or the exchange itself. Bithumb hasn’t commented on the situation by press time. According to the report, while the tax office’s first target is foreign customers trading cryptocurrency on the Bithumb exchange, withholding tax is paid to the government by the party that pays money in a transaction, in this case Bithumb, rather than the customers.

“Bithumb can pay 80.3 billion won and [theoretically] afterwards collect the amount from its foreign clients, but practically it’s impossible,” Kim Woo-cheol, a University of Seoul professor of taxation, said in the report.

Korea Joongang Daily cites an anonymous source at the exchange explaining that although the Korean government banned foreigners from opening accounts on crypto exchanges in December 2017, they still used the country’s trading platforms.

“So were transactions using fake names. Even for the exchanges, it’s difficult to know who the investors actually are and how much their trading profits are. It’s questionable what the taxation was based on,” the source said.

Korea’s Income Tax Act currently does not recognize cryptocurrency transactions as taxable events and there are no clear rules about taxing crypto in the country at this point.

Earlier in December, the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance said it would introduce specific regulations for taxing crypto in the coming year. In another step towards regulating the industry, Korea’s central bank published a report saying it will hire experts to study distributed ledgers, cryptocurrencies and CBDCs (central bank-backed cryptocurrencies).","Even though the cryptocurrency industry is not new to ups and downs, 2019 has turned out to be the year with the most surprising reveals. The long-lasting bear market of 2018 moved market analysts to call it the year of regulatory reckoning, leaving many jurisdictions uncertain about how to treat cryptocurrencies.

However, 2019 also turned out to be the year of the comeback, as big tech giants like Facebook moved from banning crypto to embracing it.

Escalating global events such as the trade war between the United States and China have shifted investors’ point of view on the utility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but there is still a lot to be done even as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission continues to turn down every other Bitcoin ETF proposal.

As the year comes to a close, here is a look at the companies, individuals and various crypto projects that managed to come out on top in 2019, as well as those that failed to mark the year as a positive in their books.

The winners

Bitcoin’s double growth

This year, Bitcoin and the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency industry celebrated its tenth anniversary as proof of the resilience of Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation. However, at the beginning of 2019, the cryptocurrency industry was just recovering from the so-called crypto winter of 2018.

Fortunately, Bitcoin kicked off the year with a bullish trend that resulted in an approximate price increase of 11% higher by the end of the first quarter. Anthony Pompliano, the co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital asset management firm, shared his view with Cointelegraph:

“Bitcoin’s price is up significantly in 2019 [as there are] more buyers than sellers on a net basis this year.”

As the trading volume and market capitalization increased throughout the second quarter of the year, Bitcoin led the market with a 165% gain as its price surged from $4,103 to $10,888. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s market dominance increased from 54.6% to 65%.

Among the reasons that have promoted Bitcoin’s continued growth despite a struggling market is the view that the digital currency can act as a hedge in the wake of increasing global uncertainty. This year, the U.S.–China trade war saw most investors look to Bitcoin and gold as hedges. Pompliano also told Cointelegraph that there were other contributing factors:

“The biggest moments probably revolve around the announcement of Libra and the subsequent reactions, both positive and negative, from various folks across the traditional and cryptocurrency markets.”

However, it was not all sunshine for Bitcoin in 2019. Over the third quarter of the year, a bearish outlook emerged as Bitcoin’s price decreased significantly as 100 billion in market capitalization was lost. Fortunately, even as the market struggled to gain ground against the bears, Bitcoin not only closed the quarter with the least amount of loss but also increased its market dominance by 5.4%. Ultimately, of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin’s performance has been the best so far.

Compared to assets from other markets, Bitcoin’s performance throughout the year is still far from tenuous. For instance, even though gold is regarded as a reliable store of value, its price has only increased by 17% since January. Even the S&P 500 Index, although with an excellent performance of +21%, is still dwarfed by Bitcoin’s growth throughout the year. Beyond price, Bobby Lee, CEO of the Ballet crypto wallet, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin has benefited from several major technological developments:

“2019 was a great year for Bitcoin bulls because of the advances in the open-source ecosystem. Lightning Network is increasing Bitcoin’s transaction capacity, wallets with built-in, user-friendly features (Wasabi, Samourai) are improving privacy.”

Gods Unchained’s rise to popularity

According to reports, Gods Unchained, a blockchain-based virtual card game built on Ethereum, emerged as one of the highest-grossing and most popular blockchain games in 2019. This came about after the platform completely sold out its Genesis Card Pack to the tune of about $6.2 million. This came about after Blizzard, the creators of Hearthstone (a digital trading card game) banned Hearthstone player Chung Ng Wai (also known as Blitzchung) for expressing support for the Hong Kong protests. The Hearthstone game developer also stripped Blitzchung of his winnings.

In addition to the backlash received from the gaming community, Blizzard’s actions were criticized in a tweet by Gods Unchained that claimed Blizzard “care[s] about money more than freedom.” Gods Unchained also promised to compensate Blitzchung for his lost winnings while offering him an invitation to their $500,000 tournament.

Related: Blizzard Bans Hearthstone Player, Blockchain Comes to Rescue

The tweet by Gods Unchained was retweeted over 10,000 times, and Google searches for the game have since surged. Unlike Hearthstone, Gods Unchained is decentralized and uses blockchain to ensure that players truly own in-game items and have the freedom to trade them at will.

In a move to give online game players long-term incentives, James Ferguson, CEO of Gods Unchained said that the game is “leveling up the outdated practices of the gaming industry.”

Coinbase’s continued expansion

In the past, Coinbase maintained a reputation for employing a rather selective strategy for adding coins to its exchange. As one of the big league exchanges in the crypto space, Coinbase is also known for having significantly fewer large-scale hacks. In a year that saw other major exchanges like Binance fall victim to large scale security breaches, leading to the loss of thousands of Bitcoin, Coinbase stands out as a reliable and safe platform.

However, the company was heavily scrutinized by Twitter users this year over its acquisition of Neutrino, a startup that collects cryptocurrency transactional data using the blockchain. For most Twitter users, this move seems to facilitate the exchange’s spying on its customers.

However, Coinbase’s move to acquire Neutrino is, according to a Coinbase blog post, part of its goal to support all assets while complying with applicable laws. In addition to acquiring Neutrino, Coinbase has doubled the number of listed cryptocurrencies on its exchange since 2018. Coinbase’s aggressive listing approach has seen the addition of coins such as Dash, Cosmos and Waves, to mention just a few.

The company has almost constantly been making news throughout the year, from making acquisitions to denying them, as well as securing multiple patents along the way. Meanwhile, Coinbases’s Visa debit card solution has also seen exponential growth this year, now available for use in even more countries.

In May 2019, the company also expanded its reach to more than 100 countries while making its USDC stable coin — previously only available in the U.S. — available in 85 of those supported countries. In comparison, Coinbase was only available in about 32 countries last year. Its aggressive expansion appears to be in direct competition to other global players like Binance.

Binance ventures further

Ask any market analyst and they will admit that initial exchange offerings have grown into a big business in 2019. Reports have revealed a high demand for IEOs right from Q1 2019 to Q3, not to mention the fact that they collectively raised over $1.5 billion in the first half of 2019 alone. Unlike initial coin offerings, the biggest determining factor for a successful IEO is the availability of liquidity, and what better way to access liquidity than launching an IEO on a popular exchange.

That is why Binance and its native cryptocurrency BNB have had one of the best years yet. As one of the biggest marketplaces for digital assets, Binance enjoys a significant share of the trading volume. The exchange’s performance has been so exceptional that the Binance Coin has gained value by 150% over the year. When taking everything into account and considering year-on-year growth, Binance Coin has even slightly outperformed Bitcoin.

Also, Binance expanded its reach with the launch of a fully independent U.S. arm of its trading platform. Despite heavy regulatory pressure that keeps the Binance exchange in the U.S. from operating in states such as New York, the company’s partnership with BAM, a registered money service in the U.S., has so far given the exchange some leeway.

The losers

Facebook’s uncertain Libra launch in 2020

Facebook’s announcement of its Libra cryptocurrency has been one of the major events of 2019. However, on the unveiling of Libra as a stablecoin backed by a select number of national currencies, U.S. lawmakers reacted with skepticism, summoning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to multiple hearings.

Related: What Is Libra? Breaking Down Facebook’s New Digital Currency

At its core, Libra is a stablecoin backed by real money and lets users buy, sell and send money at nearly zero fees across borders. According to the project’s white paper, Libra’s overall mission is “to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers millions of people.”

Libra’s white paper further claims that it will use “a new decentralized blockchain, a low volatility cryptocurrency, and a smart contract platform” to empower about 1.7 billion unbanked people. This will be achieved through the use of Facebook’s WhatsApp, Messenger and Calibra, which is a digital wallet designed for Libra users.

Despite Libra’s ambitious plan to empower the unbanked, the Libra project has not only come under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers but also faced internal problems of its own. While sharing his thoughts with Cointelegraph, Ballet wallet’s Lee expressed optimism about Libra, saying that although “legislators and regulators in the United States and Europe understand that non-government currencies are a threat to their power, government opposition will diminish over time.” Lee further explained:

“Governments will change their stance because they will come to understand that they can’t control or stop Bitcoin, and they will prefer to have their citizens use centralized corporate coins that can easily be regulated, monitored, and pegged to fiat currency.”

Despite Libra’s ambitious plan to empower the unbaked, the Libra project has not only come under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers but also faced internal problems of its own.

The U.S. Congress has asked Facebook to pause further development of the Libra projects, and cynics now believe that the project will not get out of the starting blocks without the government’s approval. Multiple European countries have also spoken out against the proposed cryptocurrency, while China announced that it will soon launch its own stablecoin, a national central bank digital currency, likely as a retaliatory measure. Furthermore, in the wake of increased scrutiny from government regulators, some of Libra’s high profile backers like Visa, eBay, MasterCard and PayPal have abandoned the project.

A rocky year for Circle

In October 2018, Circle, a cryptocurrency firm based in Boston and backed by Goldman Sachs teamed up with Coinbase to launch the Centre consortium. Counting on its reputation as one of the most well-funded crypto startups, the two companies aimed to help accelerate adoption of cryptocurrencies. Through the Centre consortium, Coinbase and Circle would increase liquidity to the crypto industry through the issue of a stable coin called the USD Coin.

In July this year, Coinbase and Circle broadened participation into their consortium in a move that will allow other financial entities interested in the project to issue the USD Coin. In the announcement, the Centre network mentioned that “a natural next step is to imagine a new global digital currency” that would include a basket of tokens backed by a variety of stablecoins. Simply put, Centre’s plan is to go with a Facebook-like approach to create a global currency.

However, Circle has had a rocky experience throughout 2019. Even though the USD Coin has received a positive reception, with Centre claiming that the stablecoin has been used to clear on-chain transfers worth over $11 billion, Circle closed its mobile app, reduced its fundraising goal by 40%, and laid off 10% of its staff between May and June this year. Just recently, the company let go of 10 more of its employees, citing efforts to streamline its services.

The latest news of layoffs from Circle comes after the recent transition of the company’s co-founder Sean Neville from his position as CEO to a seat at the company’s board of directors. However, a representative of Circle has denied any connections between the recent layoffs and Sean’s transition, telling Cointelegraph that:

“None of this is related to Sean transitioning out of the co-CEO role. Sean will continue to serve on Circle’s board.”

Craig Wright’s court battles

When Australian-born technologist Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2015, most people in the crypto community were skeptical and thought nothing of it.

Most people expected that the Satoshi Nakamoto impersonator would have scurried back into obscurity by now. However, Wright and his claims have continued to headline the news throughout 2019. Wright claims that he invented Bitcoin a decade ago and mined over 1 million BTC along with his late business partner Dave Kleiman. After Kleiman’s death in 2013, Wright claims that he put the mined Bitcoin in the “Tulip Trust.”

However, the Australian entrepreneur and computer scientist was sued by Kleiman’s estate in 2018 for allegedly stealing up to 1 million Bitcoin. In the past, it is said that Wright and Kleiman worked together on mining and developing Bitcoin. According to Kleiman’s family, Wright stole between 550,000 to 1 million Bitcoin — worth about $10 billion.

The ongoing case led to Magistrate Judge Bruce’s ruling that ordered Wright to turn over half of his Bitcoin holdings and intellectual property from before 2014 to Kleiman’s estate, presuming he is indeed Nakamoto. On Oct. 31, the trials re-emerged after Wright pulled out of the settlement agreement to forfeit half his Bitcoin and intellectual property.

In addition to his court battles, Wright was scrutinized by the crypto community after presenting what was considered forged documents as evidence of him being Nakamoto in another case of Wright against Peter McCormack. Wright’s case against McCormack is based on the fact that McCormack’s repeated statement that Wright is not Satoshi is harmful to Wright’s reputation. Most recently, Wright presented another document that allegedly proves how he came up with the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym.

Bitcoin ETF’s continual rejection by the SEC

Even though U.S. regulators have always left a window for the possibility of approving Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the future, up until now, every single attempt to license a Bitcoin ETF has been met with failure. In October this year, an ETF proposal filed by Bitwise Asset Management in conjunction with NYSE Arca was rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to meet legal requirements that prevent illicit market manipulation.

In fact, all Bitcoin ETF proposals presented to the SEC have been rejected on concerns about fraudulent activities and market manipulation. One of the main criteria for approving an ETF is establishing the underlying market of a new commodity-based ETF.

Related: The SEC Does Not Want Crypto ETFs — What Will It Take to Get Approval?

If the underlying market is resistant to manipulation, regulators can give the ETF the go-ahead. Given the complexities of the Bitcoin market, it seems approval from the SEC is unlikely. Despite the earlier rejection of Bitwise’s application, the SEC later announced that it would review Bitwise’s proposal once again.

While speaking to Cointelegraph on the realistic timeline of the first Bitcoin ETF approval, Charles Lu, the CEO of the Findora fintech toolkit provider said, “For a Bitcoin ETF proposal to gain SEC approval, the sponsor will need to prove that real price discovery is happening as opposed to market manipulations.” In Lu’s opinion, this will not happen anywhere soon, since the SEC would require “surveillance sharing agreements” with the big exchanges.

2019 and 2020

Overall, the crypto industry has shown some significant growth over the past year. Although volatile, Bitcoin is showing significant signs of growth. More institutional investors are looking into the industry to find more ways to invest as well. Even though there is a downtrend in market cap and trading volumes, prominent traders believe that a turn of fate might just be around the corner, especially for Bitcoin holders.

Out of all the winners and losers of 2019, perhaps Facebook Libra is one that stands to be most impactful in 2020. For most onlookers, it will be interesting to see whether Facebook’s Libra project will turn a new leaf and launch successfully in 2020. If it does, there is a high likelihood that big changes will take place throughout the entire industry.","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post

The fourth quarter of 2019 was a rough ride for the price of Bitcoin and altcoins at large. On the one hand, BTC was still able to maintain its almost 90% year-to-date gains as we wrap up the year. On the other hand, markets have seen a very different story in the altcoin space this year. Large-cap names like ETH and XRP suffered double-digit losses, while the values of smaller names, such as XTZ and LINK, have doubled or even tripled in some cases. What’s behind the altcoin performance divergence, and how will this play out in 2020?

The End of “Alt-Season”?

The term “Alt-Season” has been one of the buzzwords in the crypto space throughout the year. The general altcoin space had a decent rally in the first half of 2019. The total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin surged from below $48 billion to $142 billion in late June, and that was pretty much the “Alt-Season.” As the price of BTC peaked, altcoins started their six-month-long correction and failed to reclaim the 365-day moving average. The Crypto Total Ex-BTC Market Cap has given up almost all its yearly gains, approaching where it started this year.

Figure 1

Crypto Total Ex-BTC Market Cap – YTD Chart

In our October publications “Altcoin Season: To Be or Not to Be?” and “Party’s Over”, we’ve gone against the markets and are being skeptical about the new beginning of the “Alt-season”. However, our reports also highlighted the possible divergent performances between different altcoins and the importance of picking and choosing when it comes to altcoin investing.

Small Names, Big Performances

Despite the overall weakness in the altcoin space, we’ve seen some smaller altcoin names outperform their bigger peers and even BTC, and LINK and XTZ are some of the examples. Figure 2 underlines the massive gains that we’ve seen in LINK and XTZ. In comparison, the Crypto Total Ex-BTC Market Cap is likely to end on a quiet note, while ETH and XRP are already in the red.

What’s Behind the Divergence?

We believe that the increasing popularity of Bitcoin derivatives trading, investment appetite, and lack of institutional interest may have attributed to the performance divergence in the altcoin space.

Bitcoin derivatives trading has been one of the fastest-growing parts in the crypto space. Demand for futures, options, and swaps trading has been increasing across all client segments. The spectrum of derivative trading has been getting wider with increasing product selections. We believe that the growing derivative trading demand has been drawing the overall crypto investing needs away from the altcoin space, particularly from the institutional client group. This draw–away effect has been more noticeable in large-cap altcoins.

Figure 3a

Figure 3b

BitMEX XBTUSD Open Interest

The investment appetite for the overall altcoin space has been decreasing over time, and high volatility could be one of the factors. Generally, assets with low volatility are more attractive to investors or HODLers, while higher volatility assets tend to get more attention from speculators. However, over-speculation often results in massive price fluctuations, and that’s the last thing that long-term investors and institutions would like to see. We believe that’s the case with some of the mid/small-cap altcoins.

Figure 4

BTC/Major Altcoins 30-Day Volatility vs. Daily Returns

Lack of institutional interest could be another reason behind the altcoin performance divergence. We know that one of the reasons why BTC has been gaining value is because institutions have been buying, and BTC has always been the very first step for traditional financial giants to step into the crypto space. While firms like Fidelity Digital Assets expressed their intention to support ETH in 2020, Tom Jessop, president at FDAS, admitted that the demand for ETH custody remains subdued. Moreover, for institutions that would like to expand their crypto exposure beyond BTC, additional regulatory challenges and obstacles would like to follow suit, and that could be a hurdle, especially for large-cap altcoins.

The Shifting Narrative

Although altcoin names like ETH and XRP have been underperforming BTC and some small altcoins, the outlook of some of the large-cap altcoins, such as Ethereum, is not as gloomy as prices suggest. We’ve noticed that the market narrative on ETH has quietly shifted from being a utility token to more of a high-value transaction settlement application, thanks to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Figure 5

Total ETH Locked in DeFi

Data from DeFi Pulse shows that the total ETH locked in the DeFi system has almost reached three million. Digital assets, financial smart contracts, protocols, and DApps being built on the Ethereum blockchain are expected to proliferate in 2020. Although the current ETH DeFi lockup portion accounts for about 2.5% of the total ETH supply, the number is expected to increase gradually in the coming years. The price of ETH could benefit from the growing ETH lockup. Ethereum’s open financial system has been taking shape, and we expect the impact of this system to be more imminent and evident to the markets in 2020.

Furthermore, other major altcoins have started to show distinctive characteristics. Some of them go further into the payment world, while others are committed to serving enterprise transaction needs. In addition to the Bitcoin halving, this increasing vibrant environment could make a new impact on the altcoin space in 2020.

Conclusion

Looking forward, the Bitcoin halving event is expected to happen in May 2020. It will likely be a dominant theme of the whole crypto space before and after the halving occurs, and the market dynamics will be likely to change in both the BTC and the altcoin world. The way investors prepare for the halving could implicate sentiment, and that’s something that all crypto watchers should keep a close eye on. On behalf of the OKEx teams, may the New Year bring you happiness, peace, and prosperity.

It might strike one as obvious, but interest in careers related to cryptocurrency is directly correlated to the price of Bitcoin and the crypto markets. With prices and interest nowhere near the 2017/2018 highs, it’s important for companies to get creative when hiring for talent instead of expecting job seekers to find them.

LinkedIn analyst Devin Banerjee recently plotted the hiring of blockchain developers against the average monthly price of BTC and illustrated the point:

In LinkedIn’s 2018 Emerging Jobs Report “Blockchain Developer” was the #1 emerging line of work with 33x YoY growth, while ""Blockchain Developer"" was nowhere to be found this year on the report.

Logically, the correlation makes sense. Not only do individuals want to invest their personal assets into Bitcoin and other cryptoassets when the markets are hot, they also want to invest their careers into the industry as well. As the investment market cools, so does the interest in cryptocurrency related careers.

For hiring companies, it’s important to remain resourceful when recruiting in times of crypto market cooldowns. Yes, inbound interest will slow down, but if companies are creative with candidate sourcing and outbound efforts, there is excellent talent on the market.

Engineering remains king

While the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry has made significant progress in the past 2-3 years, we’re still very much in the nascent stages. The nascency of the industry means that the vast majority of available opportunities are engineering related. More than 60% of the available opportunities are engineering related, while the last 35% or so are split between Operations, Marketing, Business Development, Legal and Design.

Much of this is due to the stage at which many companies are currently at within their lifecycle. Most companies in the blockchain industry are building some type of software or technology that has yet to hit product-market fit. In the stages prior to hitting product-market fit, the most crucial hires are engineering related as there isn’t much for the company to do besides build the product.

As companies in the industry grow with a solidified product that's being used by customers, you begin to see a more diversified set of opportunities outside of engineering such as business development, marketing, operations, etc.

Post-bubble talent migration

2017/2018 not only saw an increase in the price of cryptoassets, but also an influx of talent into the industry.

Close to two years later, a large number of entrants that joined the industry during the wild, bubbly times have either moved on from their original roles or are looking for new positions.

There have been many notable executive level moves in this time such as:

Catherine Coley moving from Ripple to BinanceUS

Hunter Merghart moving from Coinbase to BitStamp

Adam White moving from Coinbase to Bakkt

Christine Sandler moving from Coinbase to Fidelity Digital Assets

Tim Plakas moving from Coinbase to Galaxy Digital

Bobby Cho (Cumberland) and Dan Matuszewski (Circle) to CMS Holdings.

The average job tenure for individuals within the blockchain industry is less than 1.5 years, according to LinkedIn, a state of affairs that is exacerbated by the pivots and stumbles that some of the larger companies in the industry have faced since 2018.

Centralization of talent

You may have heard the phrase “decentralize everything”. One thing that has most certainly not been decentralized is the distribution of talent and job opportunities within the United States.

The vast number of opportunities related to blockchain still exist in two cities, San Francisco and New York City.

Yes, there are other notable cities with talent in the US, such as Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles, but New York City and San Francisco still dominate the pack. Considering the cryptocurrency world is a unique blend of technology and finance, it makes sense that the financial capital of the world, New York City, and the capital of the tech world, Silicon Valley/San Francisco, lead the way.

And for as much hype as Wyoming’s blockchain efforts have received in the media, I believe we’re still far away from seeing any type of talent migration to the state – no matter how friendly the regulatory environment may be.","Why did this happen?

For more information you can review our Terms of Service and Cookie Policy.","Spencer Bogart, a general partner at the venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, says he’s excited for 2020 to bring about a new “vertical era” that focuses on building on top of the Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, Bogart says the “blockchain, not Bitcoin” mantra is officially dead.

He believes the industry is now moving past competitors and initial coin offerings supporting companies that looked past Bitcoin to try to build decentralized protocols on their own.

“I think investor and developer momentum has really shifted back towards ‘Hey, let’s build on the things that are working, so let’s go build on top of Bitcoin, let’s go build on top of Ethereum.’ And I think as people build up the stack of those protocols, we’re gonna see more and more useful applications and services that are built on top of them, and that’s what I’m excited about looking forward.”

Bogart also weighed in on the upcoming Bitcoin halving, currently projected to arrive on May 14, and the debate on how much of an impact it might have on the cryptocurrency’s price.

“I guess I’m somewhere in between. Look, it’s absolutely priced in in the truest sense of there are no risk-free returns to be had here. So in that sense, 100% priced in. Will price rise around the time of the havening? That’s a little bit more of a nuanced question.”

Bogart points to a 2019 survey his company conducted of more than 2,000 American adults, noting that 33% of people, as well as 48% of those aged 18-34, said that they strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement that more than 50% of people will be using Bitcoin in the next 10 years.

Additionally, 27% of all respondents and 33% of those aged 18-34 said that they were very or somewhat likely to buy BTC in the next five years.

Bogart believes the halving will drive more purchasing from those on the sidelines who are interested in acquiring Bitcoin.

“The halving kind of represents the shelling point, a natural point of convergence for capital that is on the sidelines and is interested in allocation towards Bitcoin. So, there is a significant sum of capital that is in that kind of position today.”

ADVERTISEMENT","The American Institute of CPAs’ Digital Assets Working Group has released a practice aid to offer guidance on how to account for and audit digital assets such as Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency.

The assets are defined broadly as digital records, made using cryptography for verification and security purposes, on a distributed ledger. The practice aid covers six key areas:

1. Classification and Measurement When an Entity Purchases Crypto Assets

2. Recognition and Initial Measurement When an Entity Receives Digital Assets that are Classified as Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

3. Accounting for Digital Assets Classified as Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

4. Measurement of Cost Basis of Digital Assets that are Classified as Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

5. Derecognition of Digital Asset Holdings that are Classified as Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

6. Recognition of Digital Assets When an Entity Uses a Third-Party Hosted Wallet Service



The working group plans to add more material on auditing to the document early next year as the cryptocurrency market rapidly evolves. “This nonauthoritative guidance will be updated with additional content regularly, as topics are finalized, and posted to aicpa.org,” said Diana Krupica, emerging assurance technology lead manager at the AICPA, in a statement earlier this month. “Content related to auditing of digital assets is expected to be added to the Practice Aid in early 2020.”

“I don’t know that blockchain is going to necessarily make things easier for auditors,” said Amy Steele, an audit and assurance partner at Deloitte & Touche LLP and co-chair of the AICPA Digital Assets Working Group, and a member of the Center for Audit Quality Emerging Technologies Task Force. “I do think it’s going to impact the audit profession and change things. With the use cases within an audit firm, a number of firms are looking at how blockchain can be used within the firm to synthesize the data that we have. I would say that’s still more within the ideation phase rather than the implementation phase.”

The AICPA cautioned that digital assets and the underlying technology are changing rapidly, so the questions, examples, challenges, risks, considerations, and potential procedures listed in the practice aid shouldn’t be considered exhaustive.

“This represents a great first step in addressing some of the most frequent accounting questions that people have been asking,” said Matthew Schell, co-chair of the AICPA Digital Assets Working Group and a partner at Crowe LLP, in a statement. “While we haven’t solved everything, we are making progress in providing needed guidance.”

","Xianfeng Cheng (aka Mars Cheng), the chief technology officer (CTO) of Huobi Group, is departing the firm after four years.

A Huobi spokesperson confirmed to The Block on Monday that Cheng is leaving in February 2020.

Cheng joined Huobi Global in February 2016, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining Huobi, he held executive roles at the Chinese IT firm OneAPM and lending platform Jimubox, where he served as the chief operating officer and VP of technology, respectively.

It is not clear why Cheng is leaving Huobi and what are his next plans. The Block has reached out to the spokesperson for further comments and will update this story if we hear back.

Founded in 2013, Singapore-based cryptocurrency firm Huobi is currently the second-largest employer in the industry at around 1,300 staff, according to The Block’s research.

Founded as a crypto trading platform, Huobi has today grown into a conglomerate that oversees at least ten different business lines. Some of these business lines include Huobi Research, Huobi DM (a derivatives trading platform) and Huobi Capital (an investment arm that has invested in over 60 different blockchain projects globally), among others."
2019-12-31,"Are you feeling lucky? This Bloomberg article gives the history of Bitcoin’s ups and downs in value and offers an enthusiastic view of Bitcoin’s future. We agree that Bitcoin won’t go away and will increasingly be used as a currency, primarily by the black market and investors that want to buy items with their newfound wealth – that last fact might be interesting to online merchants.

But we also have major concerns. It is unlikely that professional investors, or even miners, can be positive how Bitcoin will react to the next halving (where miners that keep Bitcoin operational and secure receive one half of the Bitcoin they used to for finding the nonce).

The first miner to find the nonce is awarded 12.5 Bitcoin today, but sometime in May that reward will be reduced to 6.25 Bitcoin. This has major ramifications on the profitability of mining and may impact the cost associated with getting transactions processed (the processing fee assures transactions will be processed in the next block of transactions).

So while looking back is easy, looking forward is messy:

“As much as it’s made a fortune for speculators and some thieves, Bitcoin’s survival will rest on further adoption. It’s not being used as a widespread medium of exchange. A few large retailers are accepting payment in Bitcoin but it hasn’t been the large-scale embrace so many had predicted. Scams are still running rampant. Interest is waning and consolidation among large owners is at a higher level than it was during the height of the 2017 bubble, which means that their influence over prices could be increasing.

Projections for the next decade abound. In the 2020s, mass adoption is surely to take off, they say. Blockchain technology will revolutionize and solve every problem in the world. On the other hand, regulatory scrutiny is likely to intensify, with central bankers paying closer attention than ever before.

In the more immediate term, some speculators forecast 2020 might be less fraught with volatility given its upcoming halving, whereby the number of coins awarded to so-called miners who process transactions is cut by 50%. That’s set to happen in May 2020 (the internet is replete with countdown clocks). The coin’s previous cut, about four years ago, coincided with a run-up in its price, pushing many crypto evangelist to believe in a repeat.”

Not mentioned is the risk associated with theft of one’s Bitcoin. The exchanges where consumers acquire Bitcoin are notoriously unsafe, as are the mobile wallets many of those markets utilize.

To protect your Bitcoin, it’s best if you can get possession of the actual Bitcoin address and then hold that address in a safe deposit box after clearing out all traces of it from your email, smartphone, and computer. Achieving this, however, takes technical knowhow or trust in smaller, less established exchange.

Overview by Tim Sloane, VP, Payments Innovation at Mercator Advisory Group","The local authorities of the Chinese province of Sichuan are clamping down on Bitcoin mining operations in the region amid a power shortage.

Reported by the Asia Times, the authorities are not only going after the mining operators but also after the power stations for supplying electricity to these businesses.

Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao – The Largest Financial B2B Expo

This month, authorities slapped a total fine of $140,000 on two power plants in Sichuan as they were supplying electricity to unlicensed mining businesses.

The hub of crypto mining

Sichuan is a province in the southwestern part of China, which receives excessive rain in the wet season, which runs from May to September. This also results in the generation of excessive hydro-based electricity, which is distributed at cheap rates.

Suggested articles Rob Frasca Talks Ndau as an Adaptive Store of ValueGo to article >>

Because of the cheap electricity rates, many mining firms flocked to the area and set up operations. However, in the dry season, Sichuan power plants fail to generate enough power required for the entities in the region, creating a power shortage.

Despite having no clear laws in favor of crypto mining, China is still dominating in Bitcoin mining hash rate with two-thirds of the total share, while Sichuan alone contributes over 50 percent. Though the government did not impose any ban on crypto mining, it is in the unwanted industries list.

Building intolerance?

Apart from the local authorities in Sichuan, the regulators in the country’s autonomous region of Inner Mongolia also started a crackdown on the crypto mining industry from last month.

Meanwhile, earlier this month, the Chinese authorities seized 7,000 illegal crypto mining devices from merchants, communities, and other entities within the Kaiping District, part of Tangshan.

Chinese crypto businesses were relieved recently as the government started to embrace blockchain technology. However, authorities soon came out to clarify the difference between blockchain and crypto, continuing its crackdown against the latter.","Bitcoin’s Next Decade Will Be Shaped by Derivatives

The last five years have been a test phase for bitcoin derivatives, which began tentatively when Bitmex eased into life in 2014. Now, as the cryptoconomy prepares to enter a new decade, derivatives products will play a pivotal role in price discovery. 2020 will be a big year for bitcoin and for the futures markets where billions of dollars will be won and lost, and the next bull market will begin.

A Year of Bitcoin Derivatives Is Dawning

In 2019, crypto futures volumes approached those of spot trading. In 2020, futures are on course to blow right past spot levels and keep on trucking. The success of derivatives platforms Binance Futures and Bitmex, as well as new products from the likes of FTX, Dydx, and Synthetix, has convinced many that 2020 could be the Year of Derivatives. And U.S. regulators are lending credence to the notion: Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the independent regulator that governs the country’s futures and options markets, recently hinted that it could approve a new crypto-based derivative product backed by Ethereum in the course of 2020.

Out-of-the-box products serve to attract new players and new capital to the crypto derivatives market. But will the spate of novel products capture sufficient volume and play a role in shaping bitcoin’s price action in the coming year? And if so, who stands to benefit most?

A Flurry of Derivatives Developments

Singapore exchange Bybit is planning to move into Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese and Spanish markets, Okex’s new USDT-margined Perpetual Swap Trading is likely to gain traction, and decentralized derivatives products are expected to see broader usage as defi adoption continues. Synthetix – the second largest defi app in the Ethereum ecosystem – has just announced a partnership with Chainlink, meaning it no longer needs to rely on centralized price feeds for its derivatives trading mechanism.

Today’s traders are now spoilt for choice, with bitcoin futures trading platforms feeding their appetite for high leverage on an array of digital assets. Traders aren’t limited to BTC and ETH, either: they can long or short altcoins such as cardano, enjin, tomo, and stellar if they’re feeling bold.

Improved fiat-crypto gateways such as Plutus’ virtual bank account and debit card have also increased the appeal of derivatives exchanges to retail investors, who are no longer locked into tether (USDT). Enhanced crypto-fiat conversion means traders can spend or reinvest their profits without needing to jump through multiple hoops. Services like Plutus enable crypto and fiat to be changed within a single app, forming the launchpad and off-ramp for traders seeking exposure to the broader cryptoconomy. Better fiat connections are often overlooked when assessing the health of derivatives markets, but these gateways are vital in driving capital in-flows.

US Futures Markets Heat Up

In terms of institutional interest in bitcoin futures, the U.S., where much of the innovation is happening, will dictate matters. One platform seeking to play a major role is Bakkt, which launched bitcoin options and cash-settled futures in the U.S. at the tail-end of 2019. While the former is the first regulated bitcoin futures contract rubber-stamped by the CFTC, the latter will initially be available via the ICE Futures Singapore exchange. In December, open interest on Bakkt bitcoin futures reached an all-time high of $6.5 million – and with the ascension of CEO Kelly Loeffler to the U.S. Senate, the next 12 months are shaping up to be interesting.

Bakkt isn’t the only platform contributing to a market that has evolved greatly since traders first sought to profit from falling prices during the 2018 downturn. Binance’s bitcoin derivatives surpassed the volumes of its spot offering at various times in 2019, leading the juggernaut to invest an undisclosed sum in derivatives platform FTX. This after it had already acquired spot and derivatives exchange JEX, a move which enabled Binance to add options and futures to its platform.

Speaking of bitcoin derivatives, CME Group’s Tim McCourt recently celebrated the two-year anniversary of the exchange’s operations in this field. In a short article noting the market’s “forward curve,” he revealed that CME had traded over 2.4 million contracts with a notional value exceeding $92 billion from 12.5 million BTC. Some speculate that the growing interest of trading exchanges like Bakkt and CME stems from reduced BTC volatility in comparison to previous years. In any case, the preponderance of such platforms gives derivatives traders plenty of options.

Competition Is Getting Fierce

As derivatives players vie for market share, battlegrounds are coming into clearer focus. Blade, the San Francisco-based exchange supported by Silicon Valley venture capitalists, just announced its commitment to zero-fee trading – a flagrant affront to perpetual swap titan Bitmex. UMA’s Bitdex specification also presents a possible route to non-custodial perpetual swaps, though more work is required to develop this concept.

So what does all this surging activity mean for bitcoin’s price? According to Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of Coinshares, the growth of the crypto derivatives market means that bitcoin’s price is becoming less relevant – which will keep it in check even after the halving. Demirors believes that bitcoin’s evolution into an investable asset will, in effect, decouple its price from both its value and supply and demand. With the crypto derivatives market coming to wider attention, a greater number of investors may also choose to hedge their positions via derivatives to manage price risk, leading to less volatility.

All told, the bitcoin derivatives market looks to be in rude health, even if it remains small when compared to other commodities markets. For one thing, traditional investors are likely to be enticed into crypto as a consequence of their familiarity, since derivatives are routinely used in regular financial markets. In fact, a great many institutional traders have thus far been reluctant to engage with crypto due to a paucity of tools to hedge trades and manage risk. 2020, then, and the decade it heads should bring greater leverage for crypto derivatives, including those in the defi ecosystem, greater liquidity, and greater competition from players old and new.

“I usually play Bach or Chopin,” Wilkins said, wrapping up his medley.

The next morning, more than 100 of the world’s most formidable figures in crypto compliance assembled to unpack one of the most pivotal regulatory developments in the history of our fledgling industry. Held June 28-29, 2019, in parallel to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Osaka, Japan, the V20 Summit was a chance for the industry to respond to a highly controversial new set of recommendations handed down by the FATF.

Some saw it as an opportunity to legitimize crypto and bring virtual assets into the mainstream financial system; others feared an assault against our community’s most fundamental values of privacy and decentralization. CoinDesk’s Marc Hochstein told me via Twitter DM he thought it might be a bigger story than Facebook’s recently announced Libra. Another journalist suggested it might be crypto’s Bretton Woods moment.

Known as the “Travel Rule” due to the fact that data that must “travel” along with a traditional wire transfer, international banks and financial institutions had been forced to comply with these standards since the mid-1990s, giving law enforcement greater transparency and traceability to combat financial crime. And while the vast majority of major crypto exchanges already have Know Your Customer (KYC) policies in place for remitters, including beneficiaries opened up a Pandora’s Box of complexity. In any case, the FATF delivered their directives in Osaka, giving G20 member countries a tight 12 months to implement the guidelines, with a review set for June 2020.

Not-so-draconian

“It would have been nice for these FATF recommendations to be more accommodating to the sector but time constraints effectively ruled that out,” said Siân Jones, co-founder of xReg Consulting. “The major nations of the world got together to set that timetable and the FATF policy group had very little time to develop something more tailored to virtual assets.”

Jones, a self-described poacher-turned-gamekeeper-turned-poacher, has worked both sides of the regulatory fence and has watched the whole thing unfold over the past few years. She said the resulting guidelines were not as draconian as they might have been, were it not for the technical experts in that policy group – herself included – that were able to provide some balance.

During her technical overview on the implications of the FATF guidance, Jones congratulated VASPs at the V20 on being included in the global financial system. She said this might come with some benefits, such as making it easier for VASPs to get bank accounts, but it would also come with responsibilities. The critical piece now was to find the most appropriate strategies to help the industry develop and innovate in ways that still meet public-policy objectives to thwart money launderers and terrorists.

“This is a rapidly evolving landscape where regulators and industry just have to catch up with the new reality,” said Jones, who was also instrumental in enacting blockchain-friendly legislation in Gibraltar. Her presentation to the V20 opened with a warning slide:

Wake up! Smell the coffee!

“The V20 was a great effort to bring the world of crypto together in one room with FATF on the sidelines of the G20,” said Bénédicte Nolens, advisor to Circle, who said that even though crypto-assets have presented a great challenge to traditional finance, they have also opened up opportunities that will continue to evolve in the years ahead.

“We have to keep in mind that the goal of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation is not to impose unnecessary process, but rather to demand process, so that the most nefarious activity in the world is starved for funding,” Nolens said. Examples of this could be slavery and the drug trade as well as terrorist activity.

A month prior, Nolens was at the FATF Private Sector Consultative Forum in Vienna, invited to present on Recommendation 16. There, she reiterated the importance of a globally-coordinated and consistent approach to implementing the new regulations in G20 member countries, to avoid a situation where firms might try to sidestep the new rules via regulatory arbitrage or through moving jurisdiction, known as “island hopping.”

She also explained how there was currently no crypto equivalent to the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) system, which is what banks use to achieve compliance with the Travel Rule, so VASPs would be forced to come up with something new. Further, Nolens observed that coordination would be tricky given the still very nascent, albeit global nature, of the crypto industry.

“It’s true the cryptocurrency sector isn’t very used to talking to regulators, and it can be very hard and very time consuming to build a constructive relationship between companies and their regulators,” said FATF Senior Policy Analyst Tom Neylan, who showed up alongside Wilkins, ready for a grilling from top VASP execs from Circle, Coinbase, Coincheck, bitFlyer, Kraken, BitMEX, Huobi, OKCoin, Bitfinex, Bithumb, Crypto.com, BITPoint, Liquid and more. “But it’s a critical step we have to go through if cryptocurrencies are going to become a real part of peoples’ daily lives.”

At the V20, Neylan told attendees that regulation can be a good thing for industry; it’s not something we should fear.

“The fear was that these new rules would force VASPs out of business,” said Ronald M. Tucker, convener of the V20 and founder of the Australian crypto exchange Bit Trade. “This risked driving the industry back underground and into dark markets, which, ironically, would make it even more difficult for law enforcers and regulators to do their job.”

Tucker was quick to realize the true gravity of the FATF intervention, as he dealt with a similarly existential threat back in 2014, when Australia was grappling with the issue of double taxation. The rules meant consumers were taxed at the time of buying crypto, and again later, when they used it to purchase items subject to local goods and services tax.

Many exchanges thought that the new rules wouldn’t apply to them.

To tackle the problem, the blockchain community needed clear direction and leadership, and at the time, there was no such vehicle. This moved Tucker to form the Australian Digital Currency Association (ADCA), with the goal of coordinating key stakeholders to develop a robust governance framework to organize all sectors. ADCA was to become a unified voice for the burgeoning industry, ensuring commercial operators were aligned, media were informed and government was educated.

Recently rebranded to Blockchain Australia, today the organization is recognized globally as a leader in regulatory engagement and best practice. And so, with the FATF rules pending implementation, and a lack of global coordination taking place, a sense of déjà vu gave Tucker the impetus to elevate ADCA’s proven formula to a global stage.

A community effort

It was just after CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 in New York City when Tucker mobilized the core V20 organizing team – including myself, Anson Zeall of ACCESS Singapore, Philippe Le Saux of GMI Post, Nathan Smale of Emfarsis Consulting and the futurist Mark Pesce, well-known for his podcast, The Next Billion Seconds, who championed the role of Summit Chair.

We had less than seven weeks to pull the whole thing together and, at the beginning, our outreach efforts were met with some skepticism. For the VASPs that had actually heard about the FATF issue (most hadn’t, so that required a considerable education effort on our part), many thought the new rules wouldn’t apply to them. Or, they thought their time and money would be better spent lobbying against the FATF.

“We spent a lot of time rallying the community to stop petitioning against the Travel Rule and start collaborating toward a compliance solution of the industry’s own design,” said Teana Baker-Taylor, executive director of Global Digital Finance (GDF), an industry membership body that sets out standards and best practices for blockchain and digital assets.

GDF members knew the FATF’s hasty timeline and global coordination requirements posed a significant risk to the industry, especially given the additional operational and commercial costs of compliance. But it was also the perfect imperative to finally get the crypto compliance clique working together on a globally interoperable solution. As such, GDF was one of the first to lend its support to Blockchain Australia and ACCESS Singapore to help get the V20 off the ground.

“As a community, we talk about mainstreaming and mass-scale adoption, but it’s often inside our own echo chamber,” said Baker-Taylor, who was named Blockchain Leader of the Year at the 2019 Women in Tech Awards. “If we want the future to reflect our ideals, we’ve got to take some responsibility and step up to educate policymakers, as opposed to resisting them.”

When a trio of policymakers pledged their support to the V20 – namely ex-FATF President Wilkins, Japanese Congressman Naokazu Takemoto and Taiwanese Congressman Jason Hsu – we observed a ripple effect throughout the industry, with huge momentum building among the VASPs. Behind the scenes, we were working like mad to rejig the agenda for Day 2 to accommodate Hsu’s schedule. Hellbent on speaking at the V20, he’d have to fly straight to Osaka from Washington, D.C., where he’d been participating in the U.S. Department of State’s International Visitor Leadership Program and other key think-tanks discussing major industry developments, such as Libra.

“I felt I needed to be there to support industry and act as a bridge between them and the policymakers and regulators,” said Hsu, who was nicknamed “The Crypto Congressman” by Vitalik Buterin in 2018. Coming from a background in entrepreneurship, Hsu is a rare breed of politician, uninhibited by the usual glacier-pace of government innovation.

“If we want to go long on this industry, we need to regulate, but the current government are still scratching their heads on how best to do it,” said Hsu. He believes FATF will ultimately shed a positive light on the crypto industry, which still struggles to shake its associations with the darknet.

In the absence of clear guidance, Hsu said it’s critical for industry players to lay down the guardrails.

“This industry is prone to security infringement and the crypto operators have to look that truth square in the eyes,” said Hsu, with a nod to the hacks, data leaks and other security hazards making headlines every other day. “If we set the bar high and pave the way for the industry to be formalised, we will see less and less misunderstandings about the true qualities of crypto from the public as well as governments. The VASPs must bring their determination to the table to fix this.”

The site for the V20 Summit was apt. After all, Japan is home to the two biggest crypto exchange hacks in history: Mt Gox and Coincheck. These hefty security breaches ultimately led to Japan’s proactive stance on VASP regulation, becoming the only nation in the world to grant legislative status to its self-regulatory body, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). The Financial Services Agency (FSA) was the regulatory body behind the establishment of JVCEA in October 2018. Both JVCEA and Japan’s Ministry of Finance were on the speaker lineup for the V20, together with representatives from public sectors including FSA and the Australian Government agency, AUSTRAC.

“The impact of hacking tends to be bigger than that of ordinary crypto-related money laundering transactions in terms of amount,” said Katsuya Toshihiko, who was the president of Coincheck when he attended the V20. The target of a major hack in January 2018, Coincheck had 500 million NEM tokens stolen by hackers, worth an eye-watering USD $530 million at the time. He says that “painful” experience is what triggered Coincheck’s deep sense of social responsibility and seriousness about responding appropriately to the FATF’s new guidance.

Yuzo Kano, representative director of the Japan Blockchain Association and co-founder of bitFlyer, an exchange, says it was Japan’s troubled history that motivated it to put its security protection and compliance standards under the microscope.

“Today, Japan is two to three years ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to self-regulation,” Kano said, demonstrating how painful circumstances can lead to innovation, provided we embrace the discomfort and look for growth opportunities. Kano spoke at the V20 about the contributions JBA has made, including its strong backing for the establishment of JVCEA as well as a Cryptoassets Governance Task Force aimed at developing safety standards for consumer protection.

Drawing insights from Japan’s story, V20 participants broke into groups to workshop a blueprint for the requirements of a technical solution that could satisfy the FATF (rather than prescribing any specific product, brand or service provider). A key outcome of these discussions was that the industry needed a governing body to represent its interests at an international level. As such, the International Digital Asset Exchange Association (IDAXA) was established as a vehicle to continue proactive engagement with the FATF.

Since the V20, more organizations have joined the initiative, and now, IDAXA represents the national blockchain associations of Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Switzerland and JBA and JVCEA from Japan.

Work to do

To arrive at something that satisfies the FATF Recommendations while still being workable for business, a sustained industry-led effort is necessary to ensure the blockchain community’s ethos of decentralization is upheld and consumer privacy is protected above all.

The V20 was an early catalyst but the work is far from done. Most VASPs are still coming to grips with how to comply and how much it’s going to cost, especially all those smaller firms that are struggling to navigate a jumble of regulatory regimes and requirements with less staff and less resources. Meanwhile, a slew of exchanges have already delisted privacy coins such as monero and Zcash due to regulatory pressure.

Despite the near-term hurdles, it’s widely believed that the crypto sector’s strong tech focus can actually help achieve FATF’s goals to stymie financial fugitives. Further, industry frontrunners in the race to compliance believe that FATF compliance and data privacy needn’t be mutually exclusive.","Ian Balina, a native of Uganda, Africa, is the founder and CEO of Token Metrics, is Kiana Danial’s guest today on Invest Diva’s Diva on the Block.

Ian Balina someone who lost 2.5 million dollars while streaming live on youtube, is one of the most recognized and probably the most controversial personalities in the crypto community. He left behind his data analytics and IT jobs at companies like Deloitte and IBM to become a full-time crypto investor and researcher.

Ian later joined IBM as an Analytics Tech Evangelist, where he helped evangelize and sell the IBM Cloud and Big Data Analytics Portfolio in North America. Ian helped drive revenues in the millions of dollars per year. He was recognized as one of IBM’s top employees by being a member of the IBM Hundred Percent Club, due to achieving more than 100% of his million-dollar sales quota. After four years with IBM, he retired from the corporate world to become a full-time cryptocurrency investor.

Ian Balina is also an influential Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Investor, Advisor, and Evangelist. He has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, CNBC, Huffington Post, The Street, INC and Entrepreneur Magazine for his work in analytics, cryptocurrencies, and entrepreneurship.

According to TheRichest.com, Mr. Balina’s net worth is $6 million dollars

Ian Balina’s ‘Diary Of a Made Man’

Ian started ‘Diary of a Made Man’, his video diary of his journal in life and in crypto investing. He became one of the world’s most prolific ICO influencers in 2017 while growing his portfolio from $37,000 to $5.36 million by January 2018. In April 2018, Ian Balina fell off his perch after sustaining a hack of his personal wallets in which he lost almost $2.5 million.

Ian is a founder and General Partner at 100X Advisors, a global blockchain investment and advisory firm,. The firm has made 15 investments in 15 different countries in the last year. He has brought a data-driven, “money-ball” approach to investing in blockchain startups, called “Token Metrics”.

Token Metrics is a data-driven cryptocurrency investment research platform that helps retail investors leverage analytics and machine learning to become better investors.

Bitcoin Price Forecast

The BTC/USD pas remained below the daily Ichimoku cloud. It now appears to have bottomed out just above the key support level of $6,406.

The pair may even be in the process of forming a Double Bottom bullish reversal chart pattern.

However, the bearish momentum still appears to be strong. A break below this key support level could open doors to further declines. Could Bitcoin reach the $4,000 again?

What do you think about Ian Balina and his controversial background? Do you think he’s a scammer out there to get people? Or do you think he truly has the best interest of people in mind?

This collaboration allows Simex’s international users to make fiat deposits via a debit or credit card, which effectively provides a fiat onramp for its clients around the world. Users are routed to checkout with the EU-registered fintech company, which takes care of the authorization, payment processing, and delivery of cryptocurrencies. This makes using bank cards more straightforward and also taps Simplex’s expertise in verifying and securing crypto transactions.

Simplex has signed partnerships with leading crypto exchanges, including Binance, to enable users to buy cryptocurrencies with their credit cards directly on Binance.com. Most recently, it has signed mobile wallet provider Broxus to facilitate buying of bitcoin and ether directly via Telegram.

Simex slapped with SEC’s suspension notice

SIMEX Inc operates what it calls ‘a multifunctional platform’ that could perform as an investment bank and crypto exchange. The company has held a token sale, SIMEX STO, to expand its services to new jurisdictions.

The US regulators, however, suspended trading in the securities of its parent entity Simex Group Inc (formerly American Retail Group), after the Nevada-based firm made several false cryptocurrency-related claims. Among them were that they partnered with an SEC qualified custodian to offer regulated cryptocurrency transactions, as well as claims that their tokens are fully registered with the commission.

Social media censorship has become a pressing issue in the crypto world. Last week, YouTube banned several crypto-related channels. Though the site quickly rolled back its decision, other companies still apply harsh policies. Twitter has allegedly banned crypto-related accounts, while China’s WeChat has banned some crypto transactions.

Of course, the problem goes beyond cryptocurrency. Social media sites have targeted users across the political spectrum. High profile bans have concerned left–wing, right-wing, and international groups alike. Even users who believe that some content should be banned might find themselves on the wrong side of an overreaching policy.

The result is that many decentralized platforms are aiming to reform social media from its current state. Anti-censorship is just one part of this trend: some projects are striving for more open moderation, while others are aiming for better revenue distribution. With that in mind, platforms can be classified in at least five categories, as follows.

1. Centralized Platforms

First, it is important to consider how centralized social media platforms operate. Google, which owns YouTube, operates several data centers, each of which houses thousands of servers. Facebook does the same. Twitter relies on third-party cloud storage as well as data centers, but each company has direct control over data and accounts.

At the same time, centralized sites can defer some control to users. Reddit, Disqus, and Discord rely on centrally-owned servers and platform-wide rules, but they also allow communities to self-moderate. It is unclear whether these companies have a lighter touch, but they share qualities with federated social networks (discussed below).

Additionally, some centralized social networks have a semi-distributed infrastructure. Telegram houses its servers in different legal jurisdictions, and its encryption model prevents it from censoring private chats. However, Telegram can ban public channels, and though it primarily targets ISIS content, it could in theory close any channel.

2. Blockchain-Powered Social Networks

Some social networks are turning to blockchain for decentralization. Users send messages, and a distributed network writes that information to a blockchain transaction permanently. This process typically allows crypto tips and payments as well. The Twitter-like Memo.cash, the blogging site Steem, and the media site LBRY fall in this category.

Unfortunately, blockchains are not scalable for mass data storage, so some blockchain-integrated social networks rely on other systems. Peepeth, DTube, and SocialX store minimal data on their chosen blockchains. Instead, they rely primarily on IPFS for data storage — which is faster, but less permanent, than blockchain-based storage.

Blockchain-powered social networks can also make use of BitTorrent. DLive, a streaming service, announced plans to join TRON and BitTorrent this week. Twister, a self-hosted social network, relies on a Bitcoin-based blockchain and BitTorrent. It is also possible to use just one of these technologies: BitChute relies on torrenting, but not blockchain.

All three approaches have a point of centralization: front ends that can choose to show or hide content. For example, Peepeth does not delete data, but it explicitly moderates content on its website. Since most users will not turn to alternative front ends, a single site can effectively censor content for the general public in some cases.

3. Decentralized Transactions

Many new social networks integrate cryptocurrency payments, which can solve the problem of demonetization — they can compensate users who have not been banned, but who cannot receive funding. Whereas YouTube and Patreon can prevent users from receiving ad revenue and donations, cryptocurrency is relatively unstoppable, KYC aside.

For instance, the crypto-monetized blogging platforms Minds and Publish0x host their content centrally and have control over that content, but pay out Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens. Coil is similar, but pays out XRP via Interledger. Block.one’s Voice network will also follow this model initially, though it may move to a decentralized content model.

It is also possible to integrate crypto rewards with traditional social networks through a browser plugin. Brave’s Basic Attention Token has been linked with seven social networks — YouTube, Reddit, GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Vimeo, and Soundcloud. Though Brave requires KYC for withdrawals, BAT can be circulated freely within the Brave ecosystem.

4. Federated Social Networks

Some decentralized social networks do not rely on a blockchain. The Twitter-like Mastodon, the video site Peertube, and other Fediverse projects take this approach. They allow users to create “instances” that are run by servers that only store their own data. Each instance can apply its own moderation rules and block other instances.

The result is a politically intricate system. Mastodon and much of the Fediverse have earned a left-wing reputation while many of their competitors tend to be right-wing. However, the right-wing network Gab has decided to join Mastodon — something that Mastodon cannot prevent. It can only denounce Gab and encourage instances to block it.

The Fediverse is also highly interoperable. Mastodon and other Fediverse apps run on a protocol called ActivityPub, which allows member platforms to communicate with each other. Some have noted that Twitter’s plans for a decentralized social media protocol is very similar. Other related standards, such as OStatus, exist as well.

5. Self-Administered Social Networks

Some decentralized social networks are very modest projects; they can be self-hosted and administered by a single user. Projects that fall into this category include Ethertweet, Newebe, Twister, pump.io, and Libertree. It is also possible for a single user to create a Fediverse instance, so federated platforms arguably fall into this category as well.

These social networks have one major feature: maximum control for the individual. They are virtually uncensorable, with no terms of use, unless law enforcement decides to intervene. The downside is that self-administered social networks have a fairly high barrier to entry in terms of setup, resulting in low usership and small networks.

Facing the Competition

Each style of decentralized social network has its own advantage. Blockchain-based networks provide a solution to bans and content deletion, while crypto payments provide a solution to demonetization. Federated and self-administered social networks, meanwhile, give communities and individuals control over content and moderation.

Unfortunately, all of these alternative social media platforms will probably find it difficult to gain traction. Social networks — especially Twitter-like discussion platforms — need plenty of users to thrive. Video and streaming-oriented social networks may not need as much adoption, assuming they are used for content storage rather than networking.

The numbers are certainly in favor of traditional platforms. Facebook and YouTube attract about 2 billion active users per month, while Twitter attracts about 330 million active users per month. Mastodon, probably the best-known decentralized social network, has 1.3 million active users. In short, alternative platforms have a long way to go.

From the dawn of a new decade for Bitcoin to progress on Litecoin’s push for privacy, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin

Jack Dorey’s Square Crypto says Bitcoin is just getting started after epic performance over the last decade.

The leading cryptocurrency soared 9,000,000% in the past 10 years, leaving every other asset in the dust.

But the Bitcoin-focused division of the publicly traded mobile payments company Square says it’s still early days for BTC.

Dorsey, who says he thinks Bitcoin has a shot at becoming the native cryptocurrency of the internet, formed Square Crypto to boost Bitcoin’s potential to become an everyday currency.

He plans to spend three to six months in Africa this year to explore how BTC can help create financial freedom across the continent.

Ripple and XRP

Ripple is offering a look at which of its announcements went the most viral in 2019.

The startup says the top post on Ripple.com last year was the announcement of Ripple’s partnership with payments giant MoneyGram, which is focused on leveraging XRP for cross-border payments.

Ripple’s developer platform for XRP came in at number two, followed by the company’s open letter to Congress and its confirmation of over 300 customers. Rounding out the top five was the startup’s Series C funding round of $200 million.

Litecoin

The Litecoin Foundation has released a new update on its push to implement privacy features for LTC, the sixth-largest crypto asset by market cap.

According to the Foundation, $18,482 worth of LTC and BTC has now been donated to the project.

The money will be used to pay for developer David Burkett to implement the Mimblewimble protocol. Burkett says he’s already making significant progress.

“After months of planning, development of the mimblewimble extension block has officially started! My efforts this month focused mostly around restructuring the core logic that will be shared between Grin++ and LTC. This involves all of the logging, serialization, crypto, error handling, and common data structures (headers/blocks/txs).”

Charlie Lee, the man who created Litecoin, says he plans to match every donation that comes in.

California has administered more than 34.4 million vaccines in total.Singapore Faces Vaccine Delays (2 p.m. NY)Singapore may be facing slower vaccine deliveries over the next couple of months, as the country considers delaying second shots.Ho Ching, the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, cited the scarcity in a Facebook post Sunday. “Yes, our vaccine deliveries are slow this month and possibly next 1-2 months,” said Ho, who is also the outgoing CEO of Singapore’s state-owned investor Temasek Holdings Pte.New Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said the government is studying holding off the second shots in order to give more people at least one vaccine dose.“There have been many international studies and it shows that even with one dose, it confers good protection without compromising efficacy,” Ong said. “Our scientists have been studying this.”CDC Shuns Federal Vaccine Mandate (12:25 p.m. NY)Any mandates in the U.S. to require people to be vaccinated against Covid-19 will be set at the local level by companies and institutions such as colleges, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.“It may very well be that local businesses, local jurisdictions, will work towards vaccine mandates,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “That is going to be locally driven and not federally driven.”Separately, on “Fox News Sunday,” Walensky cited colleges or universities that may enforce vaccine mandates for students, and that the cruise ship industry may also consider it for people about to embark on multiday journeys at sea.Walensky spoke days after the CDC announced that Americans vaccinated against Covid-19 were clear to shed their face masks in public at most times.20 Million Fully Vaccinated in U.K. (12:16 p.m. NY)More than 20 million people, or 38% of the British adult population, are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, the government said Sunday. Over 36.5 million, or 69%, have had one dose. The U.K. will open inoculations to everyone 35 and older this week as it combats cases of a highly transmissible variant that originated in India. The country reported another 1,926 cases and four deaths on Sunday. Both figures are up about 9% over the last seven days.Hong Kong Tightens Travel Rules (10:55 a.m. NY)Hong Kong will increase restrictions on arrivals from Taiwan and Singapore, the South China Morning Post reports.Taiwan, Singapore and Japan are to be classified high risk according to the city’s vaccine bubble travel arrangements.

The first batch of 1,000 oxygen concentrators have landed and are available for purchase while the rest are expected in the second half of May, it said.Taiwan Local Cases Hit Record (5:38 p.m. HK)Taiwan registered a record 206 new local cases on Sunday, after adding 180 infections the previous day. The country is racing to contain its worst outbreak of the coronavirus, while averting a full lockdown.India Virus Cases Ease (1:50 p.m. HK)India reported 311,170 new infections Sunday, continuing the downward trajectory seen in the past few days, bolstering hopes that cases may have peaked after a deadly second wave that overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums. The case tally has crossed 24.6 million, according to the India’s health ministry. More than 182 million vaccine doses have been administered.While the daily surge in cases is ebbing, there’s no let up in deaths with the Asian nation reporting 4,077 more casualties, pushing the total to 270,284. Those death toll numbers might be understated, according to local media reports of bodies floating along river banks in the northern states.The Dainik Bhaskar, a Hindi newspaper popular across India’s crowded heartland, fanned 30 of its reporters along the banks of the river Ganga in Uttar Pradesh state. They found -- and photographed -- more than 2,000 corpses across some 1,140 kilometers (708 miles). The state government claims only about 300 are dying daily.Their findings make grim reading: authorities are piling silt over more than 350 bodies lying in shallow graves in Kannauj, the reporters say; they see dogs gnawing at some of the 400 corpses just a short distance from a crematorium in Kanpur; they count 52 corpses floating down the river in Ghazipur, often crossing state borders.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Using a VPN May Get Israeli Crypto Traders in Trouble

Do you use a VPN? It’s a privacy-enhancing tool that everyone should be using, especially those with digital assets. Or do you happen to be older than the typical crypto trader? Both of these characteristics are part of a list of so-called ‘red flags’ that can get you in trouble with a new dragnet that is being established in Israel.

Too Many Red Flags

On December 31, 2019 the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority published a draft guide titled ‘Red Flags in the Virtual Assets Field’ for the public to review. The document contains a list of ‘red flags’ that is intended to help the private sector formulate a policy on anti-money laundering risks related to digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. It was compiled by the authority in collaboration with various financial regulators and members of the industry.

The authority noted that digital assets can promote economic innovation, but are “a challenge” to enforcement agencies seeking to conduct financial investigations and seize prohibited property originating from crime. Therefore, the guide was designed to help financial bodies identify activity that can be “problematic.”

The authority also said this guide was compiled in collaboration with various financial regulators and members of the industry. However, voices in the Israeli crypto community have already criticized it for having too many so-called ‘red flags’ which are the result of excessive and unjustified concerns by the regulators. “Such red flags hurt both the growing industry and technology, and the fundamental rights inherent in democracy: the freedom of the individual, the right to privacy, the right to property and freedom of occupation,” commented lawyer and accountant Ron Tsarfaty, the Chief Financial and Compliance Officer at Bit2c.

The Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority was established in 2002 as an independent financial intelligence unit acting in accordance with the international rules against money laundering prescribed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). In 2018 Israel became the 35th member state in the FATF, the intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 by the countries of the G7. In June 2019 the FATF published its ‘final guidance’ on crypto assets and service providers, which has forced many industry companies around the world to change how they do business at the expense of clients’ privacy.

Targeting Older People, VPN and Tor Users

The guide draft lists dozens of red flags and explains that in the event that one or more of these is triggered the service providers must investigate the matter and if suspicions of money laundering or terror financing arise, report immediately to the authority or the police. Among the dozens of red flags listed, many focus on users who try to protect their privacy, for example by using coin mixers or dealing in dash, monero or zcash. There is also focus on users of VPNs, Tor and any other privacy enhancing technology.

The red flags also cover obvious cases such as darknet vendors, suspected ICO pump and dumps or Ponzi scams, and ransomware hackers. However, the list of suspicious activities and clients also includes older people, users of P2P or decentralized exchanges, people who appear to be in a hurry to trade and even people who donate to charities using crypto.

The long list of ref flags that service providers, such as crypto exchanges, are required to monitor includes the following:

Purchase of virtual assets in high amounts of cash;

Purchase of virtual assets in high amounts between private individuals;

Complex activity of conversion or transfer of virtual assets, without reasonable explanation;

Change of address, telephone number or other means of identification frequently, without reasonable explanation;

The recipient of the service is not within the typical population of virtual assets, such as an older person;

The recipient of the service refuses to present a legitimate source of funds or documents verifying the information provided, without reasonable explanation;

The recipient of the service shows indifference to the terms of service, including fees and costs;

The activity does not match the normal service recipient activity and the identification documents provided by it;

The recipient of the service demonstrates pressure or urgency to obtain virtual assets and is not ready to disclose the purpose of the acquisition;

The recipient of the service is a public person (including a relative or business partner of a public person);

The service recipient requests information about the service provider’s internal systems, policies and procedures regarding the prohibition of money laundering;

The service recipient provides inaccurate or incorrect information about the transaction or its relationship with the other party to the transaction;

The service recipient mainly uses anonymous or high value currencies;

The service recipient enters the service provider’s system using an IP address associated with VPN, The Onion Router (TOR) software or another software that allows users to employ increased anonymity;

The service recipient receives virtual assets from illegal gambling sites;

The recipient of the service transacts with foundations or nonprofits that receive virtual assets;

The recipient of the service carries out transactions in high frequency or high amounts, after a long period of inactivity;

The recipient of the service frequently changes its identification information, such as address, email, IP address or bank account;

The recipient of the service shows indifference to paying high fees for switching virtual assets to fiat compared to commissions paid to other service providers.

2019 was a crazy year for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and a number of interesting events happened throughout the last 12 months. It’s hard to keep track of the day-to-day activities taking place within the cryptosphere and there may be a few incidents some of our readers missed. At news.Bitcoin.com we took the opportunity to scan our most popular articles from 2019 in order to create a year-end list to share with our readers.

2019’s Most Popular News.Bitcoin.com Stories

Bitcoin.com’s writers are entrenched in the cryptosphere and every day our writing team is on the hunt for cryptocurrency-related news. During the last 365 days, a number of our writers have published news stories seven days a week to keep our readers informed. There’s been a number of developments in 2019, as the community is dealing with digital asset regulations, crypto exchange hacks, central banks practicing monetary easing, and people claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto. The following is a look at news.Bitcoin.com’s most popular crypto articles in 2019 by order of the highest-trafficked content.

In September, news.Bitcoin.com’s Kevin Helms reported on the Reserve Bank of India’s regulatory guidelines imposed, which limited bank customers’ withdrawals from 137 financial institutions. Customers from these bank branches were only allowed to withdraw “1,000 rupees (approximately $14) per account for six months.”

After the news spread, a number of India’s citizens revolted and the government had to send police assistance to a few different banks located in Mumbai. The report highlighted how the current banking system, no matter what country you live in, continues to grow untrustworthy.

Across 2019, a great number of central banks and countries participated in practicing monetary easing. However, one specific economy, that has been considered the foundation of Europe, has been showing signs of financial failure. In August, Lubomir Tassev explained that the German economy is facing an economic crisis that could cause a domino effect throughout the EU.

2019 statistics had shown that Germany’s strong industrial economy saw significant declines in production. “[Germany] is now seeing a significant decline in production – by 2.7% year-on-year in January and 1.9% in April compared to the previous month,” Tassev detailed. “Then in May, factory orders declined 2.2% from a month ago and registered an 8.6% annual drop, the biggest in a decade.” The following month the country invoked a five-year rent freeze in Berlin.

In May, the cryptocurrency community found another suspect who might be the infamous creator of Bitcoin. Kai Sedgwick reported on how the name Paul Le Roux found its way into the cryptosphere last spring. During the Kleiman v. Wright lawsuit, Document 187 had shown an unredacted name and Wiki link which belongs to the criminal mastermind Paul Le Roux.

The document led people to believe that Le Roux was smart enough to create Bitcoin and the coincidental timing of his arrest was around the same time Nakamoto left the community. Speculators really started wondering if Le Roux was Nakamoto when an anon from 4chan’s /biz/ messageboard insisted that “Bitcoin was a project of a evil genius … Paul Solotshi Calder Le Roux.”

Satoshi Nakamoto was a popular topic in 2019, and a few of news.Bitcoin.com’s highest-trafficked articles are written about this legendary character. The day before Halloween, news.Bitcoin.com published a story about the fascinating clues left behind by Bitcoin’s notorious creator.

The editorial discusses Satoshi’s planning, theories as to why Nakamoto left the community, and conspiracy theories like the idea that Bitcoin was created by the CIA. Satoshi left behind a bunch of clues and said some interesting statements back when the monicker spoke on bitcointalk.org and the cryptography mailing list.

All year long Indian cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been waiting on the final word in regard to digital currency regulations in India. News about the regulatory situation started coming to life in the spring and in March, India’s government told the supreme court that the crypto regulations being drafted were near completion.

Attorney Jaideep Reddy of Nishith Desai, a lawyer behind a writ petition opposing the crypto banking ban by the Reserve Bank of India, told news.Bitcoin.com at the time: “The matter was heard for a very short period of time — The matter started with the counsel for the Union of India stating that its committee is in the final stages of deliberations and that the matter should be heard after that.”

During the first week of August, it was discovered that the giant retail corporation Walmart patented plans for a stablecoin backed by USD. The news followed Facebook’s announcement to launch a coin called Libra. Walmart’s attempt also followed the time when the company attempted to start its own banking services back in 2006.

At the time, politicians and financial incumbents opposed Walmart joining the banking industry and the firm got so much pushback it decided to quit the banking attempt. However, with a ‘Walmart Coin,’ the company could skip all the banking charter laws and offer customers a different kind of “savings” incentive through cryptocurrency dividends.

News about cryptocurrency laws in India was of great interest to news.Bitcoin.com readers in 2019. On July 26, headlines detailed that an Indian official who led the committee which had created the crypto ban bill resigned.

Former Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg decided to apply for voluntary retirement after receiving flak from the Indian cryptocurrency community. Supporters of friendlier digital asset laws in India, called the drafted bill “flawed” and after a few controversial tweets about crypto, he left his post. Moreover, a few days prior, members of the Indian government told the public that digital currencies were not banned.

In the first month of 2019, news.Bitcoin.com’s Lubomir Tassev wrote a review about eight different crypto debit cards people can use around the world. The editorial discussed cards issued by firms like Wirex, Bitpay, Revolut, Cryptopay, and Fuzex.

The report explained the negatives and the positive benefits to a loadable cryptocurrency card. In addition to detailed information about existing crypto cards on the market, Tassev also wrote about the upcoming card companies that planned to launch in 2019. The editorial highlights how the use of crypto debit cards “significantly expands the usability of digital coins in the world.”

Banking System Failures, More Satoshi Lore, IRS Cracks Down on American Crypto Owners, and Onecoin Crumbles

There were a hell of a lot more popular stories last year and the eight mentioned above just scratch the surface when it comes to news.Bitcoin.com’s 2019 archive. Other reader favorites in our library this year included subjects like a possible Deutsche Bank collapse, how Citi, Deutsche, and HSBC laid off thousands of employees, the Indian supreme court’s struggles with drafting regulations, and the Philippines seeing 10 government approved exchanges.

There were plenty of Satoshi Nakamoto stories and unique editorials involving the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. The news about the U.S. tax agency telling the public they planned on sending 10,000 letters to American cryptocurrency owners shocked our readers. 2019 also saw the downfall of the biggest multi-level-marketing (MLM) crypto scam of all time when the so-called ‘Bitcoin Killer’ Onecoin crumbled.

The draft legislation “Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act” was proposed on July 15, 2019 by the Democratic majority of the House Financial Services Committee. While this legislation specifically targets Libra, a new digital currency spearheaded by Facebook, the proposal aims to prevent big technology companies from operating like financial institutions.

According to a copy of the draft legislation, a large technology firm is described as a company offering an online platform service with at least $25 billion in annual revenue.

With that in mind, the bill specifically proposes that:

“A large platform utility may not establish, maintain, or operate a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.”

Facebook still plans to launch Libra, regulators express concern

Facebook (which instantly qualifies as a large technology company) still has plans to launch Libra, and continues to develop the stablecoin’s network today. Facebook also plans to introduce a range of new features in upcoming months, set forth in a press release published on Nov. 15.

Although Facebook has still not set any release date for Libra, regulators around the world are expressing concern.

As a followup to the Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance legislation, Chairwoman Maxine Waters expressed her negative sentiments about Libra, asking Facebook to put it on hold during her July 17 opening statement, saying:

“In light of these and other concerns, my colleagues and I wrote to Facebook earlier this month to call on it to cease implementation of its plans until regulators and Congress can examine the issues associated with a large technology company developing a digital currency, and take action. The Independent Community Bankers of America and others support this commonsense step.”

While Facebook has remained pretty quiet following congressional hearings about Libra, the Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance proposal would empower the federal government’s financial regulators to assess fines up to $1 million per day for violations.

Based on the drafted legislation and penalty that follows if rules are not met, large technology companies will most likely think twice before launching their own currencies and/or performing bank functions.

Will stablecoins be considered securities?

On Oct. 18, 2019, U.S. Congress published a draft bill titled “Stablecoins Are Securities Act.” This legislation is meant to regulate stablecoins, a cryptocurrency that works as a non-volatile, stable source of value, under the familiar Securities Act of 1933.

That bill states:

“Because issuers of managed stablecoins nevertheless maintain that managed stablecoins are not securities, it is appropriate for Congress to provide clarity by amending statutory definitions of the term security to include managed stablecoins.”

It would appear that the proposed legislation is a direct response to Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency, which the company described in its whitepaper as a stablecoin pegged to a basket of fiat currencies.

Assuming the “Stablecoins Are Securities Act” bill does pass, all of the laws that apply to stocks and bonds will also apply to stablecoins like Libra. Marketplace policy reporter Nancy Marshall-Genzer explained this in an article published on January 1, saying:

“This bill says that Stablecoins, which are [digital] coins, like Libra, pegged to a basket of something that is considered stable, so these coins are not supposed to fluctuate. So securities being stocks and bonds, this bill says, “Hey, Libra, all the laws that apply to stocks and bonds are going to apply to you.”

Have these bills scared Facebook?

All signs suggest Facebook isn’t backing down from releasing Libra this year. Cointelegraph previously reported that updates were recently made to the Libra whitepaper.

Although it would appear that the biggest change is the removal of dividends payable to early Libra investors, there is also talk that the changes could address concerns of Libra being classified as a security.

Libra’s whitepaper initially mentioned dividends, specifically stating: “Interest on its reserve assets would go towards system maintenance, keep transaction fees low, assist with growth, and pay dividends to early investors.”

Yet as Brummer pointed out in an article about these changes, all mention of “paying dividends” had been completely removed. While there are a few theories behind these edits, a primary guess at the motive is that Facebook wants to avoid having this new financial product classified as a financial security.","Taylor Monahan is the founder and CEO of MyCrypto. In this interview as part of The Breakdown’s end of year coverage, she argues that the level of discourse in crypto matured in 2019, with more focus on things that actually matter.

That’s important, because in 2020, she predicts a major fork-in-the-road moment, where the industry as a whole could either stay on the path set out in its cypherpunk roots, or be significantly co-opted and corrupted by the entrance of corporate and government actors into the space.","Share this article

NGC Ventures, one of the largest institutional investors in the blockchain sector, is launching “NGC Ventures Fund II” ⁠— an “All-Weather Crypto Fund” specifically designed to capture market beta and secure consistent returns in both bloom and gloom market conditions.

With fifty-plus blockchain investments under its belt and a purported lifetime track record of seven to eight times ROI, NGC’s first fund was recognized by PitchBook as one of the top ten VC funds in blockchain by volume and scale. After realizing its self-proclaimed benchmarks with the first fund (all in times of unparalleled market turbulence), NGC Ventures (formerly NEO Global Capital) is now launching a second “all-weather” crypto fund which, as the name already implies, deploys a wide range of specifically tailored investment strategies in order to secure returns in all four stages of the market cycle.

The size of the new Fund II is capped at $25 million and 80% of the fund is already subscribed upon launch. The investment vehicles employed to execute the all-weather strategy range from the acquisition of tokens, equity, and structured products (on both the primary and secondary markets), to fixed income and quant trading, arbitrage, mergers & acquisitions, staking, and mining.

The broad range of investment instruments may seem overly diverse, but NGC only focuses on two primary objectives. The first objective is to understand and predict (using various data points) the macro market cycles in order to allocate assets accordingly. To achieve this and secure a competitive advantage, NGC actively aggregates and interprets data sources across different streams using big data, AI, and artificial data analysis. The second objective is to create alpha by investing directly in projects, either through tokens or equity, and to help them grow before exiting for a profit. This could be a minority investment where NGC takes the typical VC approach to advise the company, or it could be a majority investment where it secures a majority shareholder position, grows the project, and flips it for a profit.

Breaking Down the “All-Weather” Strategy

NGC’s “all-weather investment strategy” is in huge part modeled against Merrill Lynch’s “Investment Clock” theory. Depending on the direction of growth relative to the trend and the direction of inflation, Merrill Lynch’s Investment Clock model splits the economic cycle into four separate phases: recovery, overheating, stagflation, and recession. By back-testing more than 30 years of economic data, Merrill Lynch has found that, in each respective phase, some investment instruments tend to outperform others. Appropriately, a rational investor should seek to allocate assets in line with the different stages of the market; buy stocks during the period of recovery, buy commodities during overheating, take cash during stagflation, and buy bonds during a recession.

While factors like central bank intervention, market gaming mechanisms, global economic integration, and buffering effects make the Investment Clock model quite unreliable when it comes to investing in the traditional financial markets, NGC maintains that the same restrictions do not apply within the field of cryptocurrency. In fact, the founding team at NGC believes that Merrill Lynch’s Investment Clock model should work even better for crypto because the aforementioned factors influencing its effectiveness are either not present or not very influential.

Of course, when it comes to the practical application of the investment clock model, NGC has appropriately customized it to adequately reflect the unique conditions of the cryptocurrency markets. The inflation factor from Merrill Lynch’s model is replaced with an emotional factor, whereby the price of Bitcoin is used as a benchmark for “market sentiment,” and the “GDP growth” factor is replaced by fundamental factors that represent the industry’s organic growth. These include but are not limited to: number of transactions, volume, number of wallets, number of dApps, leader entry and breakthroughs in technological development.

After accounting for the differences between the respective markets ⁠— both crypto and traditional ⁠— NGC seeks to find corresponding asset types in the crypto markets and then simply follows the same underlying logic described in Merrill Lynch’s investment clock theory. During the growth phase of the cycle, NGC focuses on equity-type assets, such as ICOs, IEOs (similar to IPO, first-and second-tier market spread arbitrage), platform coins such as Binance’s BNB (strong cash flow and repo ability), and commodity trading strategy quantitative funds (tracking cryptocurrencies on the rise).

Following the same logic during times of recession and stagflation, the fund seeks to reduce equity investments and turns to crypto-assets that most closely mimic fixed income products (for the lack of real ones on the crypto markets). In this regard, in 2018, NGC turned to crypto lending by investing in BabelFinance and to crypto staking by launching StakeX in collaboration with X-Order. Both ventures earned the fund steady returns in times when the crypto markets were losing money hand over fist.

Asia-Specific Alpha

Having crypto’s more global and more uniform nature (when compared to the traditional financial markets), we asked NGC Ventures whether they believed that there are unique opportunities in Asia that they could leverage to generate outsized alpha for investors.

Tony Gu, founding partner at NGC, said:



“Because the geographical differences are not that obvious in the crypto industry, the whole crypto market tends to move together, or in other words, share the same beta. Our All-Weather Fund is trying to capture the beta and maximize it by cycle-specific strategies”

Taking this into account, NGC believes that there are three unique aspects of the Asian markets that present some opportunities to generate outsized alpha ⁠— trading enthusiasm, technology adoption, and the mining ecosystem. Gu continued:

“Investors in Asia are looking forward to investing in good projects and when they believe they found one, they trade aggressively. This creates arbitrage opportunities between the Western and Eastern markets. In addition, this helps us get insights about where the market is moving so that we can deploy capital more wisely.”

In terms of technology adoption, NGC believes that Asian countries, especially those underdeveloped, are more open and eager to deploy new technologies (like distributed ledger technology) and that regulations in those countries are more friendly to blockchain-enabled innovations, which could incubate disruptive innovations that can’t exist in the Western world.

On the last assertion, Gu states:

“Crypto’s mining ecosystem is largely based in China. The whole value chain includes chipset production, miners, mining farms, trading, financing, and payments. This creates unique investment opportunities in each phase of the value chain, which we are well-positioned to capture. One example is BabelFinance (one of NGC Ventures’ portfolio companies). They have grown to be one of the biggest crypto lenders in the world by servicing the large miner community in China.”

What’s Next for the Crypto Industry?

When asked to forecast some of the next up-and-coming segments in crypto that they think will see the most growth, Gu said:

“Infrastructures like public chains (layer 0 – layer 2), oracles and privacy, etc. are still important and will still see growth. On top of the infrastructure, we expect to see the growth of applications. Ranked by magnitude, they will mainly be financial services (both crypto native finance, and adoption by traditional institutions), virtual economy (gaming, content, IP, data exchange, etc) and social (consumer marketing-related applications)”

While the team behind NGC is satisfied with their current results, interpreting the fund’s past performance as a definite validation of their modified investment clock theory would be overreaching, to say the least. Given the unique intricacies and the short history of the crypto markets ⁠— only time will tell whether there are parallels to be drawn between them and the traditional ones.

However, according to one analyst, that rollercoaster ride is about to get a lot less bumpy, and probably even boring for most crypto investors and traders over the next few months, before Bitcoin breaks out and the bull market really begins.

Boring Bitcoin Price Action To Precede Next Rally

Traders and investors often like to talk about what would be the “max pain scenario” that would cause the market the most heartache and confusion. Following deep drops in price, late-shorters get squeezed in surprise pumps, only to cause investors to FOMO into a bearish retest, much like what happened in late October 2019 on the heels of news Chinese President Xi Jinping offering his support of blockchain technologies.

But not all “max pain” scenarios result in powerful price movements that cause major losses to both sides of traders – buyers and sellers – or are a result of extreme volatility. Sometimes, the most painful scenario of all is a boring, sideways market.

First tweet of the year has to be one of those macro ones. Bollinger band width [denoting volatility] on the monthly chart pushing all time lows. Would love to see a few months of boring to setup nicely for a solid and sustainable rise later in the year. pic.twitter.com/QWTudP7JqL — dave the wave (@davthewave) January 1, 2020

That’s exactly what long-term crypto analyst Dave the Wave sees for the future of the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. According to the analyst, Bollinger Bands Width – the measure of the deviation between the two, outer Bollinger Bands denoting volatility, is reaching the lowest levels in recent years, making for great “setup” for a “solid and sustainable rise later in the year.”

However, what comes before the sustainable rise, is boredom and sideways trading, likely in ranges that the cryptocurrency has already spent the last few months trading within, adding to the monotony traders may feel during this period of reduced volatility.

Max Pain Scenario For Crypto Traders Is Sideways at $6,000

Bitcoin spent a short period of time within a tight, sideways trading range at the start of the year as the asset began being accumulated at low prices. But a surge in buying fueled by the PlusToken scam may have caused Bitcoin to break out prematurely, causing a parabolic rally and devastating selloff.

Even during this short-lived phase, crypto traders were often complaining about how boring the price action was, after becoming accustomed to price swings of a few th0usand dollars a month throughout 2018. During that time, Bitcoin made repeated trips to support at $6,000.

Once again, Bitcoin appears to be testing and retesting lows in the $6,000 range, and could spend the better half of 2020 doing so. Such price action is bound to cause extreme boredom in crypto and Bitcoin, which could cause more capitulation than the losses have themselves.","Craig DeWitt, director of product at Ripple, has been working on a personal project for a couple of months now. His mission is to connect digital content creators, such as musicians, directly with consumers to help cut costs.

“When you cut out the middlemen you get lower prices, more revenue to the artists, and more art,” DeWitt told The Block. To that end, he has built a blockchain-based platform called xSongs, where artists can upload and sell their music directly to users for XRP. When an artist uploads music to the platform, xSongs runs a series of checks, including copyrights.

The platform has gone live today in beta form, which means users can buy songs in XRP. They can pay either via the Payburner wallet or any other wallet. Payburner is a noncustodial crypto wallet, also developed by DeWitt, on top of the XRP Ledger.

“We’ve built a wallet experience designed to allow artists to accept payments from anywhere in the world and for buyers to have that 'one click' experience anywhere on the web,” DeWitt told The Block.

DeWitt further said that he got inspiration from Bandcamp for developing the xSongs platform. Bandcamp is an online music company that allows artists to share and earn money from their music. “They’ve done an amazing thing and they clearly care about their indie artists who would probably never be able to monetize without their platform,” he said, adding:



“While Bandcamp charges 15% plus a 6% processing fee for a total of +21%, xSongs is a direct to artist model which means that platform fees and processing fees will always be 0%.”

Despite those fees, fans have paid artists $445 million using Bandcamp, and $8.9 million in the past 30 days, according to its website.



Monetization plans?

When asked about monetization plans for xSongs, DeWitt said he is currently “not interested” in doing so. “I’m personally covering the costs...I think when you build something that people love, then monetization stuff will take care of itself in time.”

DeWitt said he has personally funded about 500 Payburner accounts i.e. 10,000 XRPs - currently worth about $1970 (When you initially fund an account on XRPL, the ledger reserves 20 XRPs).

Previously available in closed beta form, xSongs had around 100 artists and about 500 songs on the platform, said DeWitt. Looking ahead, he hopes to have at least 1,000 artists on the platform and 10,000 music sales by H2 2020.

DeWitt is currently working with Chris Opler, a software engineer at Ripple, on the xSongs project. The duo has also got a hackathon team that is starting to work on the project in their free time, said DeWitt.

“Once we have a following and are seeing some real scale, we’ll start adding the same kind of artist-centric marketing and content that Bandcamp offers today,” DeWitt told The Block.

He added that music is “just the beginning;” anything digital such as e-books, art, etc. will eventually be sold directly from creators to users. “With a peer to peer music marketplace scaling on its own, imagine all the other digital content that could be sold in a similar fashion."""
2020-01-02,"In late 2017, Bitcoin piqued the interest of millions of people hoping to capitalize on the ongoing frenzy and, as a result, drew the attention of various traditional media outlets. The press seemed largely skeptical about the concept of decentralization but proceeded to report on Bitcoin’s erratic price movement.

This year, as the space has become more regulated, cryptocurrencies saw a notably different kind of coverage. The industry’s Wild West days are over, and media outlets — most of whom were quick to bury Bitcoin at least once over that period — are now focusing on how cryptocurrencies are entering the agenda of Big Tech and, for instance, the People’s Bank of China.

Still, many spectators remain unconvinced — as illustrated by United States President Donald Trump’s tweet earlier this year that summarized the most popular concerns about cryptocurrencies in under 280 characters and was covered by most mainstream media outlets (with diametrically opposed views regarding the critique’s potential impact on Bitcoin’s value). The president’s tweet read:

“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....”

Here are the main highlights of 2019’s Bitcoin and blockchain coverage gathered from mainstream media.

Television reports

CNN

Title: Crypto Crazy

Airing date: Sept. 9–Sept. 13

Back in August, Julia Chatterley — the anchor for CNN’s daily global business program First Move — announced she would host a week-long series called “Crypto Crazy” the following month, signaling that her audience was interested in hearing more on digital money. The show’s main objective was to “debunk some of the most popular misconceptions” about cryptocurrencies. Notably, in the first episode, Chatterley asked the guest expert to explain some not-so-basic concepts, especially for a TV audience — such as fake volume reports, whales and cold wallets. In the following episodes, the anchor focused on this year’s most mainstream crypto events, including Libra and the Winklevoss twins’ attempts to take digital assets to Wall Street.

CBS

Title: Bitcoin’s Wild Ride

Airing date: May 19

Earlier this year, CBS devoted so much as “60 Minutes” to cover Bitcoin’s many swings that happened over 10 years. To get a first-person perspective, the channel’s correspondent, Anderson Cooper, interviewed a handful of industry participants — including, among others, the guy who infamously bought two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin, marking the first time the preeminent crypto was used as a currency. “Sorry, let me just get this straight,” Cooper asked, as would any person hearing this story for the first time. “You spent about $80 million on pizza?”

Newspaper reports

The New York Times

Title: Bitcoin Has Saved My Family

Date of publication: Feb. 23

In this op-ed, the Times’ audience was presented with a curious case of how Bitcoin — often depicted as a tax cheating tool for radical libertarians or even terrorists — can actually help those living in poverty-stricken countries. Penned by Carlos Hernández, a Venezuelan economist, the essay explains how keeping money in bolívars — the local soverign currency — is seen as “financial suicide” due to the overwhelmingly high inflation rates. The annual inflation rate in Venezuela was almost 1.7 million percent last year.

The author, who had gone grocery shopping after changing his Bitcoin into bolívars, could not find any milk in about 20 shops nearby due to extreme food shortages. Still, he had to buy something that day — otherwise, his bolívars would lose value — so he opted for cheese, the closest thing to milk he could find.

Hernández, who keeps all his money in Bitcoin, says that he is not the only Venezuelian relying on digital assets — in fact, as much as $1 million worth of bolívars was traded for Bitcoin in a single day in April via LocalBitcoins.com, a peer-to-peer exchange.

On page 9 of the Times, Hernández wrote:

“You could say that cryptocurrencies have saved our family. I now cover our household’s expenses on my own. My father is a government employee — in a printing department with no paper — and earns about $6 a month. My mother is a stay-at-home mom with no income. And cryptocurrencies helped my brother Juan, 28, escape Venezuela last summer.”

The Guardian

Title: A Chinese Digital Currency Is the Real Threat, Not Facebook’s Libra

Date of publication: Nov. 11

Earlier this year, the Guardian selected Kenneth Rogoff — a professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University, who worked as a chief economist at the International Monetary Fund in the early 2000s — to write a piece on cryptocurrencies.

Rogoff focused on an important trend: digital, state-run currencies that employ blockchain. China has advanced more than others in that regard, the economist argued, comparing the country’s efforts to Facebook’s Libra, which is by far a much more well-known project. Indeed, Zuckerberg himself made this analogy during a hearing before Congress. “China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months,” the Facebook CEO said at the time. “We can’t sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don't innovate.”

“A widely used, state-backed Chinese digital currency could certainly have an impact, especially in areas where China’s interests do not coincide with those of the west,” Rogoff wrote, stressing that China’s currency will most likely be “permissioned” and hence have strict control over all transactions that it entails. Ironically, that would entirely contradict the anonymous, pro-decentralization agenda that Bitcoin is famous for — and average readers are starting to realize that cryptocurrencies are not just some internet coins, but a global technology that can change financial systems forever.

Government reports

Department of Justice

Title: The Mueller Report

Date of publication: April 19

In April, the Department of Justice released special counsel Robert Mueller’s report detailing his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. One of its major points was that Russian agents allegedly used cryptocurrency at numerous stages in their online efforts to disrupt the election, hoping to “capitalize on the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies.” Specifically, Mueller’s report revealed that the “systems used in the hacking of the Democratic Party” were paid for with Bitcoin, as were online hosting services used by websites that published the hacked materials and participated in “the targeting of disinformation at American voters.”

Indeed, while cryptocurrencies are known for the anonymity they provide, there is another side to the coin: All Bitcoin transactions are posted to the publicly accessible blockchain, therefore making it possible to identify the sender’s wallet address and track their entire transaction history.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin allowed Russians to “avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds,” Mueller’s investigation concluded.

Business media reports

Bloomberg

Title: The World’s Most-Used Cryptocurrency Isn’t Bitcoin

Date of publication: Oct. 1

Bloomberg is by no means an apprentice in the crypto world, as the publication has been closely following digital assets for the past few years. Despite being regularly criticized by biased community members for spreading FUD, Bloomberg often offers quality insights into the space.

In October, the magazine moved focus from Bitcoin to Tether (USDT) — the popular but controversial stablecoin that is designed to maintain a one-to-one ratio with the U.S. dollar in terms of value. Tether’s trading volume surpassed that of Bitcoin’s for the first time in April and had been consistently exceeding it since early August at about $21 billion per day, Bloomberg noted.

But why Tether of all stablecoins? people familiar with the company’s scandalous lawsuit might ask. The answer is simple, yet not so obvious: According to Bloomberg’s source, some traders don’t even realize they are holding Tether.

“I don’t think people actually trust Tether — I think people use Tether without realizing that they are using it, and instead think they have actual dollars in a bank account somewhere,” Thaddeus Dryja, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told the magazine. Some exchanges even mislabel their pages to convey the impression that customers are holding actual dollars instead of Tethers, he argued.

CNBC

Title: There’s Another Reason Behind Bitcoin’s 200% Rise This Year — It’s Got Nothing to Do With Facebook

Date of publication: June 25

Back in June, when Bitcoin was in the midst of a long-awaited bull rally (which would soon end), CNBC tried to pinpoint the reason behind the positive price movement. The publication suggested that it wasn’t Facebook’s arrival into the space, as many believed, but something more niche — an event called the Bitcoin halving, when the rewards to miners are cut in half every four years. The next one is scheduled for May 2020, and the tightening of supply had forced the price upward, the article opined.

Perhaps CNBC was too early to take the Bitcoin halving into consideration, but the fact that a major news source is covering the technology’s complexities for a mainstream audience is a sign that Bitcoin is not as underground as we used to think.

The Wall Street Journal

Title: If Bitcoin Looks Like It Isn’t Trading, It’s Because It Isn’t

Date of publication: Dec. 6

The Wall Street Journal has kept its overall conversvative stance toward cryptocurrencies.

“The energy that drove bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry through much of the early years has been replaced by the sobering reality that creating new global monetary standards requires more than computer code,” the publication wrote, citing data from research firm Flipside Crypto. Apparently, in the last week of November, only about 14% of the 18 million outstanding Bitcoin was actively traded.

Now, with the number of daily Bitcoin transactions falling, the journal continued, “hopes rest with institutional investors, and there have been signs of progress on this front,” citing Bakkt as an example.

Financial Times

Title: A US Recession Could Fuel a New Cryptocurrency Boom and Bust

Date of publication: Nov. 14

According to the Financial Times, if global economic decline and uncertainty about the future of U.S.–China trade lead the U.S. into recession, cryptocurrencies could serve as a financial safe haven and even experience another bull run. However, that would be followed by another price bust, the publication argued:

“The last bust made clear that gains not linked to adoption by ‘real world’ users do not last. While the underlying digital technology continues to hold promise, it has yet to find a significant user base beyond enthusiastic techies.”

Lifestyle media

The New Yorker

Title: Cryptocurrency 101 in the South Bronx

Date of publication: Dec. 2

The New Yorker published a story of Carlos Acevado — a public school teacher in Morrisania, the poorest congressional district in the U.S. — who shares his cryptocurrency knowledge as someone who got into Bitcoin back in 2014 with a group of his former students.

“When we first talked about Bitcoin in your class, I thought, Criminals,” one of Acevado’s students said. “I’m not talking about machine guns on the street,” the teacher replied. “It’s not ‘Mad Max’ out there.”

To Acevado, cryptocurrencies are more about helping “the unbanked” — which is why he created the Crypto Community Project, with the goal of building a cryptocurrency economy in the South Bronx.

“After these two days, you’re going to be the one per cent,” he told the 25 young people who had attended his class. “You’re going to know more about cryptocurrency and blockchain than ninety-nine per cent of people out there. You have the opportunity to get in on the industry right now.”

GQ

Title: Cryptocurrency Will Not Die

Date of publication: Nov. 26

GQ’s Rosecrans Baldwin interviews some of the people who were lucky enough to get in early (and some who, in their own words, “were late to the party of crypto” but still enjoyed nice gains during the crazy days of late 2017) — most of them got burned, but their morale remained unshaken. “You know, honestly, if I had a better car, I’d sell it and get back in,” said one of the interviewees. The other one admitted to selling his old car to pay some bills and get back in the game. Needless to say, that kind of devotion surprised Baldwin.

He too tried to get a hang of crypto trading, investing $100 that he borrowed from his magazine. “I spent about $10 worth of Bitcoin on 20 coins of IOTA — because I didn’t have one ‘iota’ of knowledge about trading crypto,” he writes, describing a shameless, unenlightened attempt at getting rich that might recall some early memories for most cryptocurrency holders out there.

“What is crypto?” the author ponders in his column. “A couple years ago, crypto was the future, according to your cousin at Thanksgiving.” Closer to the end of the article, he develops this idea further:

“Only crypto didn’t disappear, it just went quiet. And this Thanksgiving, the evangelists will tell you it’s bigger, more relevant than ever, only they’re not just your cousin anymore. They’re the People’s Bank of China. They’re Mark Zuckerberg. Talking about crypto today is more like talking about the climate crisis. Forget real or unreal. It’s ‘how soon,’ and ‘oh crap.’”","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

The broader cryptocurrency market came under pressure on the second trading day of 2020, as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies slipped into negative territory for the month.

The first cryptocurrency fell back towards $7,050 after being rejected from its 200-period moving average on the four-hour time frame.

BTC/USD shorts on the Bitfinex trading exchange were at their highest level since Dec 20, while BTC/USD longs were at their weakest since Dec 16

Bitcoin Cash tested towards $200 and is currently the worst performer inside the top 5 with losses of around 2.5%, while Bitcoin SV was the biggest loser inside the top 10, and traded down by around -3.5%

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is currently $184 billion as measured by TradingView, a loss of $2 billion since Jan 1.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin has slipped back under the $7,100 support level and remains vulnerable to further losses while trading below the $7,250.

Despite the recent decline, bullish reversal patterns on the lower time frame highlights that a rally towards the $8,000 and beyond remains possible while the December low, around $6,450, holds firm.

Looking at the downside potential for BTC/USD, a bearish break under the $7,000 could trigger heavy BTC/USD technical selling towards the $6,780 support level.

Total Market Capitalization

The daily chart of the total market capitalization is looking increasingly bearish while price trades below the $187 billion level.

The lower time frames show highlight that the $180 billion support level remains a possible downside target while price trades under the $187 billion level.

A recovery towards the $207 billion level is required to ignite a bullish reversal pattern with substantial upside potential. The reversal pattern highlights the $230 billion level as a possible upside target.

Overall Sentiment

According to the latest data from The TIE, sentiment toward the cryptocurrency market is neutral, at 46 percent.

Bitcoin Cash has the strongest sentiment among the top 10 at 66 percent. Meanwhile, Tezos has the weakest at 37 percent.","Ziglu, a new cryptocurrency-friendly bank by former Starling Bank co-founder and CTO Mark Hipperson, could soon launch.

Hipperson founded Ziglu in September 2018 and has been preparing to publicly launch the bank later this month. The Ziglu app is currently available in beta form.

London-based Ziglu aims to bring the best of challenger banks and cryptocurrency exchanges to create “one truly complete current account,” according to information from its website.

Through the account, it will then enable users to buy, sell and hold fiat and cryptocurrencies. It will also offer a Mastercard debit card to spend funds.



Ziglu is currently in the process of getting an e-money license from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority.



The upcoming bank reportedly has “rapid” expansion plans. Hipperson aims for Ziglu to process $1 billion in transactions in 2020, according to a recent report from Financial News London. He also looks to expand the bank into the U.S. as early as the fourth quarter of this year.","Zac Prince, co-founder of BlockFi. Source: a video screenshot, Youtube, Bitcoin Archives

Major crypto lender BlockFi aims to develop a Bitcoin (BTC) rewards credit card, with a view to rolling out this year.

In an official announcement, co-founders Zac Prince and Flori Marquez stated that the new card would allow customers to earn “an industry-leading, BTC cash-back rate on every transaction” they make, in place of conventional rewards such as air miles or cashback.

The company made no mention of the exact scale of the “industry-leading rate” in question, however.

The co-founders wrote,

“We see the credit card as a way to add value to crypto OGs, as well as a novel way to introduce crypto to non-owners in an easy, familiar way.”

The company also says that it intends to make a major overhaul of its portfolio in 2020 – with stablecoin and altcoin products in the pipelines.

“The first order of business in January will be expanding our services. In the first few weeks, we will be adding support for USD Coin (USDC) and Litecoin (LTC) with some of the most competitive interest rates in the market.”

BlockFi also spoke of launching a mobile app and “adding fiat on and off ramps” in the months ahead.

The New Jersey-based company is not the first to offer credit card crypto rewards services. Last year, American start-up TomoCredit launched a similar card, which offers USD 10 in crypto for every USD 100 spent on with the card – a Mastercard-issued offering from Arkansas-based Evolve Bank.

BlockFi, which started out offering dollar loans secured by crypto, added two further products to its range in 2019: an interest-accruing account and a crypto trading platform named BlockFi Trading.","Mechanics of a Crypto Heist: How SIM Swappers Can Steal Cryptocurrency

The true vulnerability at the heart of SIM-swap attacks on crypto accounts lies in crypto exchanges' and email providers' variable implementation of 2FA.

Recently, I shared with you how alarmingly simple it was to not only ""hack"" my own email account but then to use that compromised account to hack my other online accounts. Given how SIM-swap attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges escalated in 2019, I wanted to better understand these modern-day bank heists as we go into the new year. My hunch was that SIM swappers were using hijacked phone numbers like a set of keys to open locked doors into a world of online crypto accounts. Would I (or a hacker) have the same success hacking my crypto exchange accounts using just my phone number?

The first step in hacking my cryptocurrency accounts was gaining access to my personal email account with just a phone number. As I did in my first ""hacking"" experiment, I chose the ""forgot password"" option on my Yahoo account and was able to reset the password using only my publicly available username (my email address) and an SMS code sent to my mobile phone.

The fact that I only needed to type in the SMS code sent to my mobile phone indicates that single-factor authentication was in place here, not two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA is the practice of authenticating to an account using (1) something you know, (2) something you have, or (3) something you are (biometrics). In the case of the SMS code, I simply had to type in ""something I had"" without a second factor proving my identity. This means a hacker who SIM-swapped my phone number would be able to reset my email account within a matter of minutes, even though I added my number to these accounts for added security. (You can read more about how SIM swapping works in my earlier experiment.)

After resetting my email password with an SMS code sent to my phone number (which could have been swapped to a hacker), the next step involved using that email access to identify and reset passwords on my cryptocurrency accounts. For a cybercriminal, the end goal is transferring bitcoin or other crypto assets to the attacker's crypto wallet.

I navigated to my first cryptocurrency account (let's call it Account #1), entered my publicly available email address as my username, and chose the ""forgot password"" option. Account #1 sent an email message to my now ""hacked"" Yahoo account. I was able to click the password reset link, enter an SMS code from my (SIM-swapped) mobile phone, and change the password on Account #1.

I tried the same technique with my second crypto exchange account (Account #2). This account did offer the option for application-based 2FA (such as Google Authenticator), but I had disabled that in favor of traditional password authentication. Given these settings, when I clicked ""forgot password,"" I received a simple password reset link to my (hacked) Yahoo account that allowed me to set a new password and gain full access to Account #2.

At this point, I had gained access to an email account and two cryptocurrency accounts in about 10 minutes or less. These steps demonstrate how an attacker receiving text messages to a compromised mobile number could take over email accounts and easily gain access to crypto funds. Had I been an attacker, I could have quickly transferred crypto assets from my exchange accounts to a series of other crypto wallets and laundering sites that would funnel the money through various untraceable paths. This would leave the victim with little recourse to recoup the stolen assets.

Some cryptocurrency platforms have built-in mechanisms to prevent a SIM swapper from facilitating such a quick compromise of accounts. For example, one exchange where I opened an account (Account #3) allows single-factor authentication but implements a 24-hour lockout period before the password reset will take place. This effectively times out SIM swappers who have a short window in which to empty accounts before the stolen number is retrieved by its rightful owner.

This table highlights the variability in SMS authentication security options offered by crypto exchanges:

Crypto Exchange Authentication Password Reset Account #1 App-based 2FA/optional Email link + SMS code Account #2 App-based 2FA/optional Email link Account #3 Single-factor (creds)/IP check 24-hour wait period

As I learned firsthand, several exchanges still allow for password resets via a link sent to an email account, which could easily be hacked by a SIM swapper in control of a phone number. Most exchanges offer stronger application-based 2FA for resetting passwords, but many still allow users to default to weaker single-factor authentication. For example, my Account #2 defaulted to application-based 2FA during registration, but users can log in before enabling this setting.

Similarly, while Account #1 offers more secure forms of 2FA such as application-based options, it also allows users to opt for SMS-based authentication settings that created the vulnerability in this experiment. Traditional bank accounts generally require more in-depth authentication to reset a password, such as Social Security number or security questions. Until cryptocurrency accounts implement similar password reset requirements, SIM swappers will continue to target these exchange accounts using the techniques outlined above.

It's clear that the true vulnerability at the heart of SIM-swap attacks on crypto accounts lies in crypto exchanges' and email providers' variable implementation of 2FA. Until all crypto exchanges force the implementation of more secure application-based 2FA, these vulnerabilities will continue to allow for SIM-swapping attacks against crypto accounts.

Since the platform’s launch, the Bitcoin Cash-centric blogging site read.cash has gathered a lot of traction. The website’s user base publishes interesting content and new material on a daily basis with the most popular authors gathering tips in bitcoin cash for their work.

Also Read: These Are the Bitcoin Stories You Loved in 2019

Read.cash Blogging Platform Leverages Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash

About a month ago, news.Bitcoin.com reported on two blogging websites that reward users in crypto for producing content. One of the platforms featured was read.cash and ever since that initial report, the application’s user base has grown significantly. The creator of read.cash explains in the About section that the site allows users to publish content (text, images, videos) with the ability to earn BCH if people enjoy the work produced. “If a reader likes your content – he or she can upvote your post by sending some amount of bitcoin cash (BCH) to your online wallet,” the website’s creator notes.

The website’s posts are stored in a traditional database, but the system uses onchain transactions for peer-to-peer upvote payments. “These are done on-chain and censorship-resistant,” the read.cash website details. While perusing the read.cash front page or main news feed, there is a number of blog posts from unique authors covering a variety of subjects. There’s also a bunch of well known BCH proponents who utilize the read.cash blogging site.

How to Use Read.cash

Signing up for read.cash is fairly intuitive and takes only a few minutes to get started. The first thing the website does after you press the ‘register’ tab on the top right side of the screen is give you a simple rules disclosure notice. Essentially the owners of read.cash will not tolerate pornography, or “anything hate-filled, name-calling, trash-talking, personal attacks or insults.” If you accept this agreement, then you are brought to the registration window which asks you to enter a valid email address and give yourself a read.cash username. You can also quickly register with a Cash ID and Badger wallet in order to skip giving the website an email address.

After signing up, the platform gives you a welcome message and the next screen gives you a 12-word seed phrase for the read.cash native BCH wallet. Read.cash highly recommends that you write down the seed phrase as you would with any other noncustodial wallet. The website also stresses that it doesn’t recommend storing more than $10-20 on the platform. From here, read.cash gives you the BCH address tethered to your account and you can begin using the site.

If you want to write a post using read.cash, in the top middle section of the website there is a ‘write’ tab, which brings you to a page that allows you to format a post. You are asked to add a title and there’s a section for you to draft the body of an editorial. Read.cash allows you to also add a header image and there’s a help page that teaches users how to format subheadings, italics, bold text, clipboard support, embedding images, creating lists, embedding videos (Youtube and Vimeo), code markups and blocks, blockquotes, and more. The step-by-step guide explains how to save the work and publish the post to the main read.cash feed when the draft is finalized.

If you hover your mouse over the username on the top right, it will show you a dropdown menu which shows your articles, saved drafts, affiliates, sponsorships, and full access to the native wallet. With the read.cash native wallet you can send funds to another wallet, deposit BCH, and back up your seed phrase again if you lost it. Read.cash also allows you to tether a unique image to your profile picture, write a bio, and tie a few website links to your profile.

Future Enhancements and One-Time QR Codes

The read.cash platform has published a roadmap, which displays a list of objectives the website’s developer plans to add in the future. In no particular order, the read.cash blogging site hopes to add a section for communities, email notifications, user mentions, and more. A large portion of the roadmap’s goals have been completed and the list shows all the tasks that have been checked off. So far, using the website is easy to get used to, especially if you are already familiar with other social media applications and forums.

There’s a great number of posts published on the read.cash platform and if you like a particular author’s content you can give them some BCH at the bottom of each post. In order to upvote the content and give the author BCH, simply press the button that says “encourage the author to write more.” You need to have BCH in your native read.cash wallet to tip the writer, but if you haven’t deposited funds you can opt to use a one-time QR code invoice. Read.cash users can also share content with sites like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Pinterest. If you want to continue following an author’s work, you can subscribe to an individual writer’s feed.

A Giant Obstacle: Amplifying the Network Effect of Decentralized Social Media

Read.cash is promising, but like the slew of other blogging sites that leverage cryptocurrencies, it will need to continue attracting users. There have been many platforms that have attempted to create blogging and social media sites that integrate the benefits of censorship-resistant onchain transactions. However, they have all faced an enormous obstacle which is amplifying the network effect enough to outpace centralized incumbents.

Still, the use cases and platforms that leverage cryptocurrencies are still young and there’s a chance that any one of them could potentially gain ground on a social media giant. Especially when the platform is powered by the overall user base and it rewards users for providing good content. Such platforms look nothing like the centralized blogging sites today that censor people while reaping 100% of the benefits produced by popular content creators. The hope is that someday, applications like memo.cash, read.cash, and other crypto powered solutions will break the mold.

However, there are still a number of loose ends that have yet to be tied up: one of the most important ones, notably, seems to be custody.

Indeed, while many crypto “traditionalists” continue to preach the gospel of personal responsibility and “not your keys, not your coins,” other members of the community seem to be pushing for more centralization and more regulation–an insured world of crypto investing in which money is protected if a hacker should hack or if something else falls through the cracks.

Not your keys, not your bitcoin 🤷‍♂️ 🔑🗝️🔐 — hodlonaut🌮⚡🔑 (@hodlonaut) November 1, 2019

Interestingly, the two sides of the argument seem to fall somewhere close to the lines between retail and institutional traders–folks on the spectrum of users and providers on the retail side of things seem to be the strongest advocates for decentralized exchanges and self-sufficient custody measures.

On the institutional side of things, however, there is a push toward building out third-party custody solutions.

In fact, a lack of adequate custody solutions has often been pointed to as one of the major factors that institutional investors have stayed out of crypto, both from a practical and regulatory standpoint.

However, a recent study conducted by Binance Research found that in spite of calls for better custody solutions for institutional investors, the institutional investors that have made their way into the crypto space don’t seem to be using third-party custody solutions in the ways that many thought that they would.

Indeed, of the 72 institutional respondents to Binance’s custody survey, 92 percent said that they stored their funds on an exchange, while only 2.6 percent said that they made use of third-party custody solutions. And here’s the kicker–because of hacks and other vulnerabilities, exchanges are widely considered to be the least secure place for cryptocurrency hodlers of any size or stripe to store their funds.

So, what gives? Does the current paradigm of third-party custody providers fail to provide the right kinds of services for institutional investors? Are third-party custody solutions really necessary? Or, are institutional investors uneducated, uninterested, or something else?

Recently, Finance Magnates spoke with Dmitry Tokarev, CEO and Founder of Copper, a London-based institutional cryptocurrency custodian. Dmitry broke down Binance’s findings and spoke about the current state of crypto custody and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.

Different kinds of institutional investors have different kinds of custody needs

Dmitry explained that first of all, he believes that the vagueness of the term “institutional investors” has led to some confusion within the space. “Some people think it [means] pension funds, some people think family offices–but in reality, there are several layers within that space.”

“We call it ‘buy-side’, basically,” he continued. “So, who’s buying the products? Who’s buying the products on the sell side? Custodians, prime brokers, exchanges, et cetera…all of them are slightly different, and all of them need to address those problems in a different manner.”

“So, for example–you have venture capital (VC) funds and you have hedge funds. In a traditional space, VC funds are the ones investing for five to seven years,” after which point “they sell the company, and that’s how they make money.”

And indeed, while VCs in the blockchain space–particularly, the ones that hold the tokens of the company they’ve invested in–can sell off their tokens and divest from a project more easily than VCs in more traditional industries, Tokarev explained that they are rather unlikely to do so. Therefore, the custody requirements associated with a VC fund can be quite different from those of a hedge fund.

”Lots of VCs have built something in-house”, but hedge funds tend to rely on exchanges as their primary custodians

“Hedge funds are slightly different because they can go full-cash or zero-cash in a matter of days,” Tokarev said. “They’re traders–they run market-neutral strategies, they run statistical arbitrage strategies,” and other, similar practices.

Therefore, while both of these kinds of institutional investors need “safe and secure custody”, the kinds of custody solutions that they use will most likely look different from one another.

Historically, Tokarev continued, “lots of VCs have built something in-house because there is no one out there that would provide [appropriate custody] for them, and that works for them.’

When it comes to hedge funds, however, “custody is obviously an essential part of the puzzle. But in reality, when you need to trade, you still need to move the funds to the exchange.”

It’s disappointing to see how far institutional custody has come and see so many exchanges that could be better safeguarding their users https://t.co/3Pgq84aoNO — Dmitry Tokarev (@tokarev_d) November 19, 2019

This is the particular predicament of institutional traders, and the reason that so many institutional investors told Binance that they store their funds primarily on cryptocurrency exchanges–in spite of the associated risks, they need to stay as liquid as possible.

If institutional investors store their balances on exchanges, are crypto custodians really necessary?

So, what to do? “If [institutional investors] have to permanently store their balances on exchanges, do [they] really need custodians?

Tokarev believes that the answer is “yes”–even if the reason is simply to reassure limited partners and possibly provide an extra layer of insurance. ”Outside of the security bit, it’s also to tell your investors that you’re not in self-custody mode. And that’s the crucial difference,” he said.

Why is this? “You can’t have an asset-manager in self custody mode,” Tokarev continued. “You can’t be at risk of an asset manager misappropriating funds and basically disappearing.”

Tokarev also said that “the fact that there is so much counterparty risk–or credit risk, however you want to call it,” is a problem that he says hasn’t been solved yet but will be solved within the new year.

For example, “if an investor is thinking of investing into a fund that trades on ten exchanges, if one of them goes down, you’ve lost your funds,” Tokarev said. “It’s very hard to do the operational risk due-diligence on all ten exchanges, especially given the fact that most of them are based god-knows-where and regulated by god-knows-who.”

Therefore, Tokarev believes that “in reality, if [an exchange] disappears tomorrow, people are not going to be that surprised,” he said. “They’re going to be like, ‘yeah, well, it’s a crypto exchange, so what did you expect?’”

This kind of risk does not go well with institutional money, Tokarev said. “So, the solution to that is to remove that credit risk from exchanges–that’s why we think that the settlement and clearing solutions that will become available [in 2020]” will bring about “a rise of prime brokerage in this sector.”

In turn, Tokarev said, this “will allow investors to get comfortable with infrastructure that asset managers will have.”

Tokarev said that these solutions could act as an important bridge between the crypto and traditional investment worlds that more institutional investors could cross–but not before they’re created.

“We need to build this infrastructure first,” he said, “because they’re not coming unless it’s there.”

”Every kind of new technology runs [according to a] cycle.”

And indeed, many industry participants who have been waiting for an injection of institutional capital into crypto are hoping that 2020 may be the year for it after 2019 failed to meet certain expectations.

But will 2020 be “the year”?

“Every kind of new technology runs [according to a] cycle,” Tokarev said. “One year, everyone gets uber-excited about it and finances the idea, and two years later, you need to raise another round [of capital], because the world has moved onto something else already, and you need to basically prove that what you’ve built is actually useful in the world.”

For crypto, the end of “that two-year [cycle] is approaching right about now, because the hype of 2017 was about this time of year,” he said.

One way that Tokarev thinks that this will manifest itself is a need for further fundraising among young companies: “we would expect a lot of startups right about now that raised traditional financing through VCs or equity financing [will] need to go into Series A fundraising rounds and continue to grow,” Tokarev said.

Alternatively, “we’ll see consolidation–for example, if you haven’t quite made it, and you need to merge with someone because you find that together, you have a better chance of getting the market–that’s something that could happen as well.”

On Monday, Poloniex contacted some of its users after a tweet circulated featuring a list of email addresses and passwords and claiming that the information could be used to log into Poloniex accounts. In response, the exchange emailed all potentially impacted users and informed them of a forced password reset on their accounts.

Cryptocurrency firms have been shutting down all over because of stricter anti-money laundering regulations.

Simplecoin, a Netherlands-based cryptocurrency 'mining pool' set up to enable collaborative discovery of new virtual currency coins, and Chopcoin, a Bitcoin gaming platform, announced they would be shutting down before the EU Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), came into effect in all EU Member States on 10 January 2020.

The 5AMLD requires providers of crypto platforms and wallets to identify their customers for anti-money laundering purposes.

""Simplecoin will become subject to a large range of AML/KYC requirements. It is because under the new Directive, we would be considered a ""custodial wallet provider"", a broad definition that will apply to many cryptocurrency operations. When the laws come into effect, we would be forced to require you, the users, to identify yourselves for anti-money-laundering purposes. We have been searching for solutions for a while, but it has become apparent that there is no way around it.

""We believe in the power of cryptocurrency and its potential. Mining should to be available to anyone and we refuse to jeopardise our users' privacy. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on mining pools and the cryptocurrency space as a whole,"" the company said in its statement.

Both companies notified its users that they had a couple of weeks to withdraw their balances.

Although some EU Member States, including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are expected to transpose the 5AMLD into law by the 10 January deadline, others are resisting the directive. The UK has undertaken to implement the 5AMLD, despite Brexit.

The recent U.S. airstrike in Iran pushed the price of Bitcoin up 4%, along with gold and oil. Further possible conflict in the region could drive BTC’s price even higher, affirming its role as a safe-haven asset.

The U.S. Department of Defense issued a press release announcing an airstrike late Thursday that killed Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a Foreign Terrorist Organization as designated by the United States. Immediately following the strike, the price of oil and gold ⁠— traditionally seen as safe-haven investments — jumped, while traditional markets took a hit.

However, oil and gold weren’t the only assets to benefit. Within two hours of the press release, Bitcoin shot up 4.1%, from $6,945 to $7,230.

The gains seem salient, with Bitcoin trading over $7,300 at press time. The reaction from the market may reaffirm the narrative that Bitcoin acts as a “safe-haven” asset, an investment that is purchased in times of global uncertainty. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 0.98% at market open and is still down 0.51% at time of writing.

However, there are some who are still skeptical of Bitcoin’s narrative. Alex Krüger, an economist and popular Bitcoin commentator, called the relationship between the news and the price jump “absolute nonsense.” Other safe-haven assets reacted well before the Defense Department announced the news.

That said, the difference in reaction time could stem from different levels of sophistication between the firms that trade Bitcoin and traditional assets. Commodities and stocks tend to have efficient markets around them, where firms employ advanced tools to obtain the fastest and highest quality information. In contrast, the resources available to firms trading Bitcoin pale in comparison.

Tim Ireland, a quantitative financial analyst, said in a conversation with Crypto Briefing:

I think it’s reasonable to think that the price action seen in these assets isn’t spurious. They all experience a substantial spike in volume and correlated price action in the hours after the news breaks. Discrepancies between the exact price action might be explained by different market composition: gold and oil are both far larger markets than BTC and likely have a much more substantial institutional presence.

Until BTC grows into an asset class with a market capitalization in the trillions, it’s unlikely that the debate will be resolved.","Bitcoin jumped the most in two weeks after a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian military commander, fueling speculation that heightened geopolitical turmoil might spur demand for the cryptocurrency in 2020.

The digital asset’s price jumped 5 percent Friday to $7,300 as of 16:07 universal coordinated time (11:07 a.m. in New York). The surge, which appeared to follow gains in oil and gold prices, pushed bitcoin into positive territory for the year-to-date, now up 2.2 percent.

Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency-focused research firm Quantum Economics, noted in an email that the U.S. attack drove up prices for gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset whose value is expected to hold in times of geopolitical or economic instability. Many investors speculate that bitcoin bears similarities to gold, in terms of its perceived resistance to inflation.

Higher oil prices could make investors nervous about future economic growth while also potentially pushing up consumers’ costs at the gas pump, stoking faster inflation.

Another consideration is whether the escalating tension might spur demand for bitcoin among Iranians, who have shown an appetite for cryptocurrencies in recent years as the Middle Eastern economy faced a host of sanctions ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.

In late December, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech in Malaysia that Muslims might need their own cryptocurrency to “save themselves from the domination of the U.S. dollar and the American financial regime.”

Iran has “long been seen as one of the hotbeds for bitcoin adoption” due to U.S. sanctions on money transfers stemming from the country, not to mention a “very unstable economy,” according to Greenspan.

But the news likely precipitated purchase orders from some investors who were already planning to buy bitcoin, Greenspan wrote.

“The Iranian market in and of itself is likely too small and slow to have caused this move single-handedly,” according to Greenspan. “More likely, one or several players have been waiting on the side for a good buying opportunity below $7,000 per coin, and it seems one has presented itself.”","How Bitcoin halving will affect the cryptocurrency market and what you can do to capitalize on it.

Halving is regarded as a strong bullish catalyst.

The history may be a lousy financial advisor this time.

Altcoins will track Bitcoin's price movements.

In less than five months, the Bitcoin network will go through a momentous event that has the potential to bring about drastic changes to the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin's block reward will be slashed in half, which won't pass unnoticed.

Bitcoin halving in a nutshell

Every 210000 blocks, the Bitcoin network undergoes a reduction fo the remuneration received by miners. The procedure is known as halving. Considering that miners spend about 9 minutes and 20 seconds on average to find a block, halving happens approximately once in four years. Initially, miners got 50 BTC for each discovered block. However, as a result of the upcoming halving, since 2020, they will get only 6 BTC for the same work.

Many industry players believe that halving will become a robust bullish catalyst for Bitcoin, that will eventually resume the upside trend and hit new all-time high (ATH) ahead of the event.

The experts from the investment company Grayscale noted that Bitcoin tends to gain ground both ahead and after the halving. BTC, the first cryptocurrency, began growing about a year before the event, continued moving to the North, and reached a new top approximately in a year after. In 2013 the value of bitcoin increased by 12000%, while in 2017, the price jumped by 13000%.

Notably, the correction that followed quickly morphed in a sharp sell-off. The first cryptocurrency tumbled down, but then resumed the upside ahead of the next halving.

This time may be different

Many experts, including Pantera Capital CEO, Dan Morehead, and Tom Lee, the head of the Fundstrat Global Advisors, predict the rise of the first cryptocurrency to a new ATH within a year or so after the event. The forecasts vary from $20000 to positive infinity.

However, the third halving may be less straightforward than the previous two iterations. Several experts believe that it will be a non-event as it has been already priced in. Moreover, this time we are heading towards the halving with bearish sentiments dominating the market, which is against the pattern of halving in 2012 and 2016.

Also, it should be noted that Bitcoin has a solid derivatives market that allows users to speculate on Bitcoin price via futures, options, and CFDs (contracts for difference). These investment tools distort market reactions to the fluctuation of physical supply and demand.

According to Meltem Demirors, the chief strategist of the investment company CoinShares, derivatives markets are a strange animal that have the power to deprive the producers of their right to set prices. She pointed out to other commodity markets with a substantial range of available derivatives, where the market is driven by speculation as the vast majority of the participants trade paper contracts to speculate on the price.

Altcoins will follow the lead

All top cryptocurrencies followed the same pattern. Many experts noted that altcoins are closely correlated with BTC prices. As a result, Bitcoin halving led to strong growth across the digital assets market.

The trend is clearly traceable on the second Bitcoin's halving that took place in July 2016.

Thus, Litecoin started growing a few months before Bitcoin's block reward reduction. However, having risen by several dollars, the cryptocurrency retreated to the previous levels. However, precisely one year later, Litecoin reached the highest levels in history. In July 2016, the coin was valued at $4.15, and in July 2017, it cost about $53.

Ethereum demonstrated similar momentum. At the time of the halving, the price fluctuated insignificantly. However, a year after the event, ETH rose from a level of $10 to over $270. Also, the first significant increase in XRP was recorded a year after the Bitcoin halving.

Correlation is waning

While the experience implies an impressive growth across the board, it is still difficult to predict exactly the impact Bitcoin halving may have on altcoins in 2020. According to the research carried out by HodlBlog, the correlation between Bitcoin and top altcoins had been growing every year until recently. So in 2017, 75% of the top 200 coins by market capitalization had a correlation of 0.67 or higher over the past two years. In 2018, the correlations between top cryptocurrencies and BTC was extraordinarily high. Over 75% of the top 200 coins had a correlation of at least 0.87.

However, in 2019 this indicator began to decline. The average correlation coefficient for the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization decreased from 0.89 to 0.58.

If the correlation is positive, the coin is likely to move in the same direction as Bitcoin. Negative correlation implies that the coin will tend to move in the opposite direction. If the correlation is zero, the coins have no linear dependency. This information can tell which coins will be most affected by the BTC price changes.

Bitcoin halving: The bottom line

Many iErndustry players use retrospective analysis to forecast a strong Bitcoin price growth after halving. While these expectations may prove to be right in the long run, the immediate market reaction may be less clear-cut due to increased volumes of derivatives and speculative trading. As a widely expected event, it is mostly priced in, which may result in ""buy the rumor, sell the fact"" type of reaction and cause Bitcoin's price decrease right after the event.

Altcoins with a high positive correlation with Bitcoin, such as Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), or Monero (XMR) are likely to copy the price movements of the first digital coin in the long run.

If you consider speculating on Bitcoin or altcoins at the time of halving, make sure you have the right risk management strategies in place.

This article belongs to the 20 trading ideas for 2020 series. Check the full list of 2020 pieces.","As we turn our calendars to 2020, now is an opportune time to reflect on the year ahead. What does our financial future hold in store? With the S&P 500 booming, it’s difficult to imagine a shift toward alternative finance, but the landscape could change in a hurry.

Geopolitical and corporate forces are on a collision course, and our financial lives might be upended in an instant. From China’s exploration of a digital yuan to Facebook’s insistence on Libra (its own digital money), the world’s powers are gearing up to seize financial control. The question is, will it work? Simultaneously, legacy digital currencies—especially the hundreds of cryptos that arose in 2017—could fall by the wayside.

With that in mind, here are my predictions for digital money in 2020:

Bitcoin will soar again

After a rejuvenating 2019, it appears bitcoin is on the rise once more. While its underlying market is virtually inscrutable—billions of dollars shuttle between traders in the black market—there is one fundamental change on the horizon. Sometime in May, the bitcoin network will automatically reduce its “block reward,” the money paid to miners who secure the network.

While miners currently receive 12.5 bitcoins (market value: $87,000) for adding each new block of transactions, the network will programmatically adjust to provide a smaller payout, a reward of just 6.25 bitcoins. This reduction, which occurs every 210,000 blocks, is called the “halving,” or sometimes, the “halvening.”

The last time this happened—in July 2016, when the reward dropped from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins—the crypto market wasn’t nearly as popular. Back then, bitcoin traded in the mid-$600s. Now, though, with greater attention on its contracting issuance rate and finite supply, bitcoin’s price could rocket up the charts. While some argue the halving is “priced in” (i.e., everybody knows it’s going to happen), others suspect the shrinking reward will make buying bitcoin more urgent.

Ethereum will crater

Kicking a project while it’s down isn’t my style. But with so little to show over the last three years, it’s hard say that ether’s market cap ($14 billion) is justified. Arguably, if bitcoin ascends, it might take ether with it.

But if there’s any rationality to crypto trading (hint: there’s not) then ether should rightfully plunge. Perhaps I’m locked into an outdated expectation that ether will be more than digital money—its creators billed ethereum as a decentralized internet, a place where peer-to-peer platforms could flourish without corporations. From file storage to new-age lenders, ethereum was/is supposed to change everything. Maybe my prediction is colored by my disappointment. But, other than currency, there still isn’t a provable use case for ethereum—and as long as we have bitcoin, who needs another one? It’s time for the market to reflect ether’s bland reality.

Facebook’s Libra will not launch in 2020

Continuing with my hard-truths tour, I anticipate that Libra will not launch this year—at least not in anything close to the format Facebook initially promised. Can you even imagine Facebook launching a digital currency in a US election year? If Libra launched and was even remotely tied to election interference, there would be hell to pay.

Libra has already stained Facebook’s reputation, showing that the company jumped on the blockchain bandwagon without much planning, and it (briefly) made regulators laser their focus on big tech. If Facebook moves forward, I’d expect it to make Libra much less crypto and much more conventional finance—something like a Facebook debit card, not full-blown Facebook money. In my view, it’s much more likely Facebook will focus its effort on WhatsApp Pay—and hopefully, warding off fake news.

China will start public experiments with its digital yuan

All right, it’s time to get bold. While there’s been a lot of buzz about China’s digital money experiments (link in Chinese), I’d wager that this is the year when the country will actually release something to the public. The digital currency/electronic payments (DC/EP) plan has been years in the making, and I see little reason why China would continue to wait in the wings.

While I don’t expect a complete rollout, China might begin limited tests of the DC/EP, perhaps with corporate partners. As the country makes its push onto the world stage and grapples with possible US sanctions, this centrally-planned effort could shift the balance of financial power. And it’s something that few others have the wherewithal to pull off.

Yes, there are challenges to be ironed out with a digital wallet system, but with the increasing desire for insights into citizen/consumer behavior, a digital currency—issued by and linked to the People’s Bank of China—would provide exactly the leverage the country seeks. My guess would be that this happens in the middle of the year.

Blockchain projects continue to fold

The quiet collapse of the blockchain industry hasn’t made headlines. But projects are absolutely running out of money—and patience. How long are programmers and community managers willing to work on something that doesn’t ship? Or just doesn’t make sense?

In 2020, I think lots of blockchain developers—and especially researchers—will return to academia. Likewise, the hangers-on in the marketing machine will move on to the next hot thing. Perhaps cannabis or 5G?

The SEC will approve a bitcoin ETF

Finally, I’ll go out on a limb once more to say, I think the US Securities and Exchange Commission will finally approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Realistically, there’s little reason for the agency to hold it up any longer. Concerns about bitcoin market manipulation don’t relate nearly enough to the financial product itself. Additionally, it seems, the competition from a bitcoin ETF would probably make private investment vehicles lower their fees.

""We will sell Venezuelan oil in exchange for petros. We have already signed contracts for the sale of oil, steel, iron and aluminum, and we will sell part of the gold for petros,” Maduro told Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional, as reported by Russian news agency TASS.

According to Maduro, the Venezuelan government is successfully introducing its cryptocurrency into citizens’ daily lives. He said that at least 6 million families in Venezuela have used petro as a payment method to purchase goods and services during the New Year holidays. The #PetroApp hashtag was also reportedly trending yesterday on Twitter in Venezuela.

Petro was announced in Oct. 2017, and its sales began in Feb. 2018. According to TASS, the price of one petro is equal to the price of a barrel of oil in Venezuela (WTI crude price is currently at around $63).

As petro is pegged to the price of oil, Maduro recently said that Venezuela would back the cryptocurrency with some 30 million barrels of crude oil sitting in the country’s storage tanks. The figure, however, is drastically down from 5 billion barrels announced at the time of the petro launch in Feb. 2018.","A Deep Dive Into Satoshi's 11-Year Old Bitcoin Genesis Block

11 years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network at approximately 18:15:05 UTC and the world hasn’t been the same since. The Bitcoin blockchain came to life on January 3, 2009, and so far, more than 600,000 blocks have been mined into existence. Nakamoto’s genesis block is special and the hardcoded block has a few unique characteristics compared to the rest of the chain of blocks that followed.

The Genesis Block

This week the cryptocurrency community is celebrating the 11th anniversary of the Bitcoin network. Satoshi brought the network to the world two months after publishing the whitepaper on October 31, 2008. The launch of the Bitcoin blockchain started with a hardcoded block called the ‘genesis block’ or ‘block zero.’

The block is unique because it has a 50 BTC reward subsidy that can never be spent. Alternative coins that have copied Bitcoin’s framework also use a hardcoded block to start a new chain. Most early bitcoin blocks and the hash of the genesis block have two more leading hex zeroes. In addition to this characteristic, block zero has a message in the coinbase parameter, which represents a possible reminder of why the cryptocurrency was created. The genesis block’s message reads:

The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks

During the last 11 years, members of the crypto community have sent small fractions of BTC to the genesis block’s address. To date, block zero has 68.13 BTC, which is 18.13 BTC ($131,527) more than it originally started with. There are messages sent with the satoshis as well, as most transaction messages sent to block zero beg Bitcoin’s creator for money. Three people sent the address some funds today, and there’s been a number of satoshis sent to the address all week long. An interesting fact about the 18.13 BTC worth of outputs sent to block zero is that the funds can be spent, if Nakamoto still possesses the keys to the wallet address. Another interesting fact about the “bailout for banks” quote is that Satoshi added the statement twice into the codebase. When someone decrypts the original hexadecimal format, the “bailout for banks” quote is also written backward.

Seven-Day Theory

No one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto was, but many people believe that Bitcoin’s creator was a Microsoft user. Bitcoin version 0.1, the original Bitcoin codebase implementation, is written in the coding language C++ and blocks that were mined in the early days used a Windows GUI mining application. Nakamoto mined the first bitcoin blocks after block zero by leveraging a central processing unit (CPU), which is much less powerful than the warehouses filled with ASICs today. The network did not kick into gear right away and unlike today, with blocks processed roughly every 10 minutes, the subsequent block after the genesis block took six days. There are those that assume Bitcoin’s creator took a break between block zero and block one. Some say Nakamoto purposefully made it so the timeline was similar to the Bible’s Genesis tale when the earth was created in seven days.

Hal Finney was the first person to transact with BTC in coordination with Satoshi Nakamoto. The first transaction took place three days after block one and coins were sent to Hal Finney from block nine. Finney told the world a few days earlier he was “running Bitcoin” on Twitter on January 10, 2009. In addition to the very first transaction, Nakamoto had decided to send BTC to other network participants on the same day he sent funds to Finney. The veteran cryptographer Finney told the public in 2013 that he was the first person to mine Bitcoin alongside Nakamoto. “When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away — I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin,” explained Finney.

Nakamoto’s Pre-Release Source Code Tells a Story

While examining the first versions of the Bitcoin source code, which was a pre-code release prior to Jan. 3, 2009 distributed to bitcointalk.org member “Cryddit,” people have found some interesting details. The source code mentions certain terminology that crypto users did not know Nakamoto used at the time. For instance, he referred to the blockchain as a “timechain” and the words “bitcoin miner” can be found as well. The words “bitcoin miner” in the early code are meaningful to some individuals because Nakamoto never used that term within the original whitepaper.

Other intriguing words can be found in the early code like how Nakamoto referred to Bitcoin’s smaller units as “coin” (1,000,000) and “cent” (10,000) rather than today’s popular term “satoshis.” The source code also describes the “timechain” as “a tree-shaped structure starting with the genesis block at the root.” The pre-release Bitcoin code also contained early framework for an IRC Client, a peer-to-peer marketplace and a virtual poker game.

To a great number of people, Nakamoto’s code and initial Bitcoin launch on January 3 were the start of a monetary revolution. The software has sparked the idea that peer-to-peer and censorship-resistant money can exist, removed from governments, corporations, and any single entity. Bitcoin has also given birth to over 4,000 individual blockchain networks that have allowed transactions between global individuals across any border. The fact that the Bitcoin network and the protocol’s offspring continue to thrive today after 11 years is quite a milestone. Nakamoto’s creation has been a gift that keeps on giving.

Adam B. Levine: On today’s episode, bitcoin bounces on Iranian aftermath, happy Proof of Keys Day and 2020 plans from big exchange Binance.

Adam B. Levine: It’s January 3, 2020, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.

Adam: With geopolitical bombshells dropping in the overnight, Brad’s got the story…

Brad Keoun: Bitcoin prices are jumping today after the U.S. government confirmed that President Donald Trump authorized a drone strike in Iraq that killed a top Iranian military commander.

Since midnight London time bitcoin is up 5.5 percent, erasing a price slide we saw during the first two days of 2020, and leaving prices just slightly positive during the year so far.

It’s tough to state with precision exactly how the strike could affect bitcoin prices in the long term, but in the short term the U.S. military action appears to have pushed up global oil prices, given Iran’s status as one of the world’s biggest oil producers, and the potential for an escalation of the conflict between the two countries.

Higher oil prices could potentially contribute to inflation and, according to Ian Shepherdson at the forecasting firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, a sustained oil-price increase could make traders nervous about future economic growth.

This plays into one bitcoin price narrative, since many investors view the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation, a so-called “store of value” like gold.

Adam: Turning to the news, BlockFi, a cryptocurrency lending firm backed by investors including Galaxy Digital and the Winklevoss twins, says in a blog post that it plans to offer a new BTC rewards card that will pay out rewards in bitcoin when users make purchases, as an alternative to airline miles or cash back.

According to the company, the new credit card could provide a “novel way to introduce crypto to non-owners in an easy, familiar way.” And CoinTelegraph reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a court order on Thursday seeking to compel the messaging platform Telegram into releasing details on how it spent some $1.7 billion from an initial offering of its gram tokens.

It’s the latest volley in the SEC’s case against Telegram over an allegedly improper unregistered securities sale.

Telegram has pushed back against the charges, and legal analysts say the outcome of the case could set an important precedent for future capital-raising in the crypto industry.

Brad: Bitmain, the giant Chinese maker of computers used to mine bitcoin, reportedly plans to cut about 50 percent of its staff in the next several months.

The news comes via Cointelegraph, which in turn cited Chinese news media.

Bitmain, which saw both a slew of management changes in late 2019 as well as some aggressive sales initiatives like limited price guarantees for big wholesale customers and even rental options, describes the latest move as a “personnel optimization plan.”

According to Cointelegraph, the layoffs are expected to be completed prior to bitcoin’s upcoming “halving” expected in May, when the rewards for mining data on the bitcoin blockchain will be reduced by 50 percent, in accordance with the network’s 11-year-old design.

And in a twist of gallows humor, Dovey Wan, co-founder of Primitive Ventures and a prominent observer of China’s crypto industry, joked on Twitter that the Bitmain layoffs appeared to be the first halving of 2020.

Adam: And for today’s featured story, it’s Jan. 3, known in the community as Proof of Keys Day. The movement behind this community holiday celebrates January 3rd each year as the date on which all cryptocurrency users should take custody of any coins kept on an exchange, check your long-term token storage, or anywhere else outside your direct control. The argument here is that blockchain tokens, unlike a bar of gold or a physical stock certificate, can be easily retrieved and verified, even if just temporarily. And if there’s one thing we’ve seen in the markets over the last half dozen years, it’s that keeping your tokens in a custodied exchange isn’t a sure, or even necessarily safe, bet.

While the tradition is currently followed by a relatively small percentage of cryptocurrency holders, its purpose is both unique and pretty smart given the space. Done en masse, this is effectively a regularly scheduled “run on the bank” except the bank is the entire cryptocurrency exchange system. As the saying goes, when the tide goes out you get to see who’s swimming naked, or in this case is an exchange who looks insolvent. In traditional finance, bank runs are often seen as apocalyptic as the interdependent financial system can potentially lead to one seemingly insignificant failure dragging down much larger and even more deeply connected counterparties. But in crypto, things don’t have to be that way. So this movement takes the perspective that the only way you can ensure that your exchange can survive a mass wave of withdrawals akin to a bank run is if in real life they can survive an annual exercise where that actually happens. Think of it as the equivalent of the annual stress tests that the Federal Reserve makes the biggest banks undergo.

Now, for many traders, the idea of holding tokens anywhere besides an exchange can make them anxious, and it’s not without reason. One of the clarion calls of bitcoin and many early cryptocurrencies has been the opportunity to “Be your own bank,” which is about as powerful as you’d imagine but which comes bundled with a level of responsibility and related fear that you’ve got it wrong, which makes this something of a mixed blessing in practice.

For those who have looked at their tokens primarily as an investment which they hold on an exchange like everything else, Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins presents a reminder today, or really on any day of the year, that while blockchains give you the ability to completely control all of your coins and really put your exchange to the test, you can also just take the opportunity to learn the basics, set up a simple wallet on your phone and take possession of a single token. It can be nerve-wracking to truly be responsible for your investments, we’re just not used to it, and why would we be? Before tokens it really wasn’t possible. Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins is a low-impact, low-stress way to get a firsthand look at the personal control and related responsibility which, underlying everything, this industry is really about.

Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at 2020 predictions published in recent days by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

Brad: As we move into 2020, there are a lot of predictions flying around on what the new year promises for the crypto industry, from a potential price rally linked to bitcoin’s so-called halving, to the potential flowering of new lending and trading platforms in what is known as decentralized finance, where the functions of financial firms are essentially replicated on platforms that are distributed across many users and computers.

Today we’re going to highlight a couple of predictions made in recent days from the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its colorful CEO, known to his fans as CZ.

He’s a charismatic and sometimes polarizing figure in the crypto world, epitomized by the fact that some of the company’s top executives have gotten Binance tattoos to match his own.

CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen in late December described the almost cult-like following as a “bromance.”

Well, in a blog post on Thursday addressed to Binancians, CZ wrote that one of Binance’s key goals for 2020 is to “bring crypto to the masses.”

He predicted that by 2030, cryptocurrencies will be used to pay for self-driving rides on Uber, in addition to funding biotech research.

And in a separate post early Friday, Binance said it plans to allow customers to trade bitcoin, ether, ripple and a few other tokens against the euro for the first time.

This move by Binance comes as some investors and economists are speculating whether the dollar might lose some of its mojo in the 2020s as the dominant global reserve currency, especially in the face of challenges from rapidly advancing digital-asset technologies.

In his blog post, CZ wrote that he sees Binance’s core mission as spreading the freedom of money.

And while the company’s most high-profile success has come from its centralized cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.com, he said that the company’s leaders QUOTE strongly believe in decentralization END-QUOTE, embodied in recent efforts to create a decentralized exchange

Tying back to the crypto industry’s potential to replace cash, CZ wrote that he believes fiat will co-exist with crypto for a long time

According to the post, “more than 99.9 percent of the money supply is still in fiat, and we need to build bridges, gateways, teleport portals, or whatever you call it, to bring them into crypto.”

Who knows what the future will bring, and Nostradamus he’s not, but given CZ’s cult-like following, a lot of people in the crypto world may pay attention.

The UK is preparing to go through with the exit from the European Union that it has been planning for two years at the end of this month; in the United States, President Donald Trump is embroiled in an impeachment trial — and in spite of the fact that most analysts seem to agree that Trump won’t be removed from office, the polarization of the political scene in the US has been described as unprecedented.

Elsewhere in the world, protests are still raging in Hong Kong, India, and Iraq; economic crises continue to unfold in various places around the globe, and predictions of a global economic meltdown have haunted political discussions and media headlines for months.

Hong Kong is going to be a big driver of #crypto prices. With the political unrest and weakening domestic economy, along with a potential failure of the USDHKD peg, all of these events will drive people in Hong Kong into #crypto. Regulating ICOs is also a step in right direction https://t.co/D7z0bGCetC — Intuit Φ Consultants (@Intuit_Trading) October 5, 2019

The ways in which political unrest can affect the financial world can be difficult to quantify — however, the interconnected nature of politics, government, and finance tells a tale of deep interdependence. As we step into the New Year, it’s important to consider how the current state of affairs and the knowable, nearly-knowable, and unknowable events that will come to pass will affect world economies and investment portfolios.

Additionally, the political upheaval and change that is currently taking place in much of the world seems to have interesting effects on cryptocurrency markets. Because Bitcoin and cryptocurrency more generally are just over ten years old, the ways in which political events affect crypto have not been as closely studied as the effects on more traditional assets and financial markets have been studied.

However, as crypto hodlers enter into 2020, analysts are attempting to place crypto into a broader historical context, and to attempt to make sense of what may occur in crypto as a result of the political trials, changes–expected and unexpected–that lie ahead.

How could major political changes and upheaval affect cryptocurrency markets over the course of the next year and beyond?

Depending on where you live, BTC and other cryptocurrencies are either risk-on or risk-off assets

Bitcoin’s connection to political upheaval has much to do with its circumstantial status as a so-called “safe-haven” asset, or an asset that can be used as a safe place to store value when another asset–for example, a nation’s fiat currency–is rapidly losing value.

For most people in the developed world, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are anything but — the volatility of crypto is notorious. However, in countries that are experiencing economic crises (for example, Venezuela and Zimbabwe), BTC has been noted as a popular option for protecting savings: easily accessible, easy to store, and easy to sell.

Sukhi Jutla, co-founder and chief operating officer of blockchain-based gold jewelry platform MarketOrders, explained to Finance Magnates that “political unrest generally demonstrates a loss in confidence in the governing authorities in a country. Governments are closely tied to the financial systems in place so this has a knock-on effect on the financial landscape in a negative way.”

”At no point in history have you ever heard of someone needing a wheelbarrow full of gold to buy a loaf of bread. The same can’t be said for collapsing currency.”

“Political unrest tends to undermine the current financial systems in place and this is where you also tend to see the value of home currenc[ies] plummeting,” Jutla continued. “It is in these conditions that crypto prices tend to increase as investors move assets to find [assets] that are not controlled or influenced by one party.”

And what could these assets be? Monica Eaton-Cardone, Forbes Technology Council member, fintech expert, and chief operating officer of international cybersecurity firm Chargebacks911, also pointed out to Finance Magnates that “historically, alternative currencies rise in popularity when countries enter periods of chaos, conflict and uncertainty.”

The rise in Korean vs. US tensions could also play a role? The expectation of war/political unrest has historically led to investment/monetary protectionism – crypto could be an appealing safe haven for consumers. Re: https://t.co/FdRJOdooUW — Eva Beylin (@evabeylin) December 6, 2017

“Gold, precious metals and rare jewels are some of the traditional ways for investors to hedge their bets, diversify, and not be solely reliant on national currency,” Eaton-Cardone said.

“Additionally, if you were an immigrant fleeing from a dangerous area, diamonds and gold coins were easily portable and always maintained at least some value,” she continued. “At no point in history have you ever heard of someone needing a wheelbarrow full of gold to buy a loaf of bread. The same can’t be said for collapsing currency.”

“Cryptocurrency is gold for the technology class.”

As an easily-portable and generally valuable asset, therefore, “cryptocurrency is gold for the technology class,” Eaton-Cardone explained. “It’s even more portable than diamonds or coins, and for many investors, it’s a very attractive way to diversify.”

Suggested articles Rob Frasca Talks Ndau as an Adaptive Store of ValueGo to article >>

“I also think there’s an emotional component,” she added. “The idea of hoarding piles of gold sounds miserly and antiquated, but there’s something exciting about investing in technology.”

However, in addition to being a newer asset, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies don’t have the same cultural significance and practical usefulness that gold and jewels have: “critics point out that gold, diamonds and precious metals have always had intrinsic worth beyond the purely monetary: rare earth metals are increasingly being used in our hi-tech devices, beautiful jewelry has always been highly valued, gold is one of our most malleable, useful metals, and the hardness of diamonds has vast mechanical utility.”

“By contrast, cryptocurrency might help diversify your portfolio, but that’s where its diversity ends. It’s not like gold or diamonds. Cryptocurrency is what it is, and it can’t really be more than that. It’s more like an idea, and less like a physical object.”

Our emotions could dictate the value of crypto in the wake of political changes

But the differences between cryptocurrency as a sort of “digital gold” and real, actual physical goal may not be so significant in terms of the effects that major political events may have on them.

For example, Eaton-Cardone said that when it comes to both Brexit and the possible (though unlikely) impeachment of the US president, both events “could lead to a major spike in gold prices,” and therefore “could also fuel a rise in cryptocurrency.”

However, “it will depend on how we emotionally respond to these events.”

“Are people optimistic and hopeful about Brexit? Are we confident that the American political apparatus can withstand the impeachment process, with minimal turbulence?”, Eaton-Cardone asked. And is there a good chance we’ll ultimately end up in a better place? Or, are these events harbingers of even greater chaos and fiercer conflict, and a frightening omen of how much faith we’ve lost in national institutions?”

“The viability of cryptocurrency will depend, at least partially, on which sentiment wins out — optimism or pessimism.”

Sukhi Jutla added that although Brexit is now a certainty with a specified date, markets could still respond frantically: “wven though we know when Brexit will happen, we will continue to see erratic behavior across the money markets and this will also include the value of the pound,” she told Finance Magnates.

“In this case, I predict there will a flurry of activity in the gold and Bitcoin markets, driving both of these assets market prices upwards. In times of chaos and uncertainty, we think we do the most logical and rational things, but all we do is panic in the face of fear and this will cause the price of the pound to plummet.”

”Uncertainty and lack of confidence” could drive the flight of capital from struggling economies and into crypto — but the exact effects are difficult to measure

Even if the effects of Brexit and the impeachment drama–which are both taking place in countries with relatively stable national economies and currencies–are not significantly reflected in cryptocurrency markets, international investigator and due diligence expert L. Burke Files pointed out to Finance Magnates that the possible use of cryptocurrency as a tool for capital flight from countries with smaller, less stable economies could have a noticeable impact on the price of crypto.

“Look to what is going to happen in Iran, Venezuela, Vietnam, Lebanon, Indonesia, Turkey, Nigeria, Egypt, [and] Kenya,” Files said. Because all of these countries have been stricken with “various forms of instability and troubled economies,” the average person has faced difficulties “getting their money out of the countries or converting the money to EUR or USD,” as they may attempt to do if a national currency is failing.

“Demand from any one of these countries could out significant upward pressure on the value of a cryptocurrency,” Files explained.

One specific, parallel example of this that Files pointed to took place in Kenya over a decade ago: during the post-election violence in the country that took place just over a decade ago, “many people dumped their back accounts and loaded their savings onto the M-Pesa platform,” a mobile money and payments platform that was launched in 2007. “Much of it never came back to banks,” Files said.

Ultimately, political unrest “is just one of many supply and demand variables that impact the price of cryptocurrencies”

Indeed, “uncertainty and lack of confidence” drive the flight of capital from a struggling economy, he continued. In situations where national currency is losing its value, “people [are] willing to take a very large loss for the certainty of the value of the USD.”

“I believe the only reason you have not seen more flight capital come to cryptocurrencies is the extreme volatility of the value of cryptocurrencies married to the difficulty of using cryptocurrencies,” Files said, as opposed to other methods of securing the value of savings and investments.

But while digital platforms like M-Pesa may take savings out of banks, which can be more vulnerable at times of political unrest, they don’t convert currency into another currency or asset that could prove to be more stable in a longer-term sense.

And indeed, political unrest, “social unrest, economic problems, and generally corrupt government[s] drive away wealth,” Files said. “The wealth will escape any way it can. It will be wired out, trucked out, or (as I saw in Zimbabwe) stashed in spare tires and driven across the border. The fleeing money is called flight capital.”

“[…] Crypto is just one of many ways flight capital can leave a country[‘s economy]. Does it affect the price? I am sure it does,” Files said. However, ultimately, “it is just one of many supply and demand variables that impact the price of cryptocurrencies.”",

Thus far, 2020 seems to have brought back volatility into the cryptocurrency market. On Jan. 2, the entire market capitalization dropped nearly 4 percent, but the next day $14 billion were injected into the market. Now, it seems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP could be preparing for a significant price move.

Bitcoin (BTC)

On Jan. 3, Bitcoin went from trading at a low of $6,900 to a high of $7,440. The sudden 7.75 percent price jump created a bullish engulfing candlestick on BTC’s 1-day chart. This technical pattern is considered a bullish formation that is likely to reverse the bearish trend seen over the last few months.

It is worth noting that the fact that this bullish engulfing candlestick is overlapping the preceding four candlesticks makes it more effective. But, the bullish outlook will be confirmed once the succeeding candlestick closes above the engulfing one.

The TD sequential indicator seems to have predicted the unexpected upswing that took Bitcoin to $7,440. On Jan. 2, as Bitcoin plunged to $6,960, this technical index presented a buy signal in the form of a sequential 13. Like the bullish engulfing candle, this bullish signal will be validated the moment the current green two candlestick starts trading above the preceding green one.

Despite the bullish perspective, Bitcoin remains contained within the Bollinger bands, which have been squeezing since Dec. 10. Squeezes are typically followed by periods of high volatility. The longer the squeeze, the higher the probability of a strong breakout.

Thus far, BTC is trading within the lower and upper Bollinger band for the past 25 days. This trading range is a reasonable no-trade zone due to the high risk that it poses to trade within it. The area sits between $6,850 and $7,580.

A break below the $6,850 support level could send BTC down for a deeper correction. Based on the Fibonacci retracement indicator, such a bearish impulse could take the flagship cryptocurrency to the next level of support around the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level, at $5,470.

Nevertheless, a spike in the buying pressure behind Bitcoin that allows it to close above the $7,580 resistance level could trigger an increase in demand. If this happens, Bitcoin will likely surge to test the next levels of resistance given by the 50 and 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels, which are sitting at $8,500 and $9,700, respectively.

Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum seems to be forming an ascending triangle on its 1-day chart. This technical pattern is developing since mid-December as a direct result of ETH’s price action. A horizontal line is forming along with the swing highs and a rising trendline along with the swing lows.

By measuring the height of the triangle, at its thickest point, this pattern presents a 9.12 percent target to the upside. A close above the overhead resistance at $135 can validate this pattern, and Ethereum would likely surge to $147.70.

However, an increase in selling pressure that takes ETH to break below the hypotenuse could push the price of this cryptocurrency down. At the moment, it seems like if Ethereum closes below $127.50, it will try to reach a lower low.

The moving averages give a similar perspective. On the upside, if Ethereum can close above the 30-day moving average, it could try to test the next level of resistance around the 50-day moving average at $144. Conversely, a close below the 7-day moving average could trigger a spike in sell orders pushing this cryptocurrency down.

The “In/Out Money” model from IntoTheBlock considers the distribution of Ethereum throughout individual wallets based on the current price. Based on this metric, if ETH is indeed bound for an upswing, it will find strong resistance between $139 and $166. In this area, 3.03 million addresses are holding 15.32 million ETH.

On the downside, this model also stipulates that there could be significant support around $100. Around this price level, 3.58 million addresses are containing over 34.72 million ETH.

XRP

From a long term perspective, the TD sequential indicator could soon present a buy signal in the form of a red nine on XRP’s 1-week chart. If this happens, this cryptocurrency could be preparing for an upswing that allows it to reach higher highs. It will all depend on whether the setup trendline continues to serve as a significant support point as it has done it for the last three weeks.

Based on its 1-day chart, XRP is trading within a no-trade zone since mid-December. This area sits between the $0.184 support level and the $0.197 resistance level. Closing below or above this area will determine where XRP is heading next.

A bullish impulse that takes XRP to close above $0.197 could take it to the next level of resistance at $0.215 or $0.233. On the other hand, breaking below $0.184 could push this cryptocurrency down to $0.166 or $0.148.

Overall sentiment

Based on the previous technical analysis, it seems like the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap are sitting at a make-or-break point. An inflow of capital into the market would likely trigger a price increase. Such a bullish impulse will take these cryptos into higher highs. But, breaking below their respective support levels could push the market into lower lows. It would be worth paying close attention to the support and resistance levels mentioned above to benefit from the next major price move.

As shown in the graph below, these regions saw activity dwarfed the number of developments in Oceania, South America and Africa, which were also surveyed by The Block's Research.

As The Block's John Dantoni noted: ""All told, North America, Europe, and Asia accounted for approximately 99% of the investment deals in 2019. And despite the narrative of blockchain technology “banking the unbanked,” regions that need improvements to its financial infrastructure the most, such as South America and Africa, represented less than 1% of investment deals.""

Overall, the blockchain/cryptocurrency sector saw approximately $3.7B in investments across 741 different deals during 2019.

Funding is a prerequisite for any new crypto project, but with IEOs likely to play a reduced role in 2020, where will the all-important capital come from? While minted entities like Ripple, Tezos, and Tron certainly have the means to plow tens of millions into their chosen ventures, they can’t be expected to finance an ever-expanding ecosystem. Alternative token distribution and capital-raising strategies are therefore under exploration.

What 2020 Holds for IEOs

Initial exchange offerings became popular in the wake of the ICO market’s collapse, with Binance listing many of the most profitable IEO projects. May was last year’s high point for tier-one exchanges, with eight IEOs launching across Binance, Okex, Huobi, Bittrex and Kucoin. During the first six months of 2019, IEOs collectively raised over $1.5 billion. From July onwards though, the picture grew steadily bleaker – to the extent that there was just one IEO on these platforms in each of the final three months.

Predictions of the IEO’s demise have been exaggerated however. There may be less of them this year, but with greater pressure on exchanges to conduct profitable offerings, it can be hoped that the quality will improve. This month will see several initial exchange offerings on Coinsbit including Wolfs Group, a consulting company that invests in strategic industries and payment gateways. To date, it’s focused its energies on acquiring companies rolling out bitcoin ATMS across Europe, and is now raising funds to build out a crypto exchange, mobile app and money transfer service for Ferpay Ltd, which the company owns.

Elsewhere, quantum-proof blockchain QAN is holding an IEO on Bitbay on Jan 20. 88,888,800 QARK tokens will be made available by the QAN crypto platform that can run smart contracts in all major programming languages and which utilizes a Proof-of-Randomness (PoR) protocol. Like many of the newer blockchains, QAN is targeted at enterprises, which seem undaunted in their desire to embrace blockchain. As for the major exchanges, Binance didn’t announce an IEO for this month, but is expected to resume operations in February, with other tier-one exchanges also taking a winter break, during a seasonal spell when crowdfunding has historically dropped.

The Rebirth of IPOs

What about IPOs, the traditional fundraising model that dates back to 1602 and the Dutch East India Company? This method, which raised capital for Google, Amazon and Apple in the pre-crypto days, is enjoying something of a renaissance. Last year the cryptosphere saw initial public offerings – i.e. projects which held a private sale usually followed by an IEO – outperform ICOs in terms of average ROI for the first time ever. Ironic really, given that ICOs were originally based on IPOs.

It’s conceivable that a hybrid crypto fundraising model could gain traction this year. World Chess, an online gaming and media company, recently touted a hybrid IPO for 2020 wherein digital tokens will be issued before shares are floated on the stock market. MERJ, the national stock exchange of the Seychelles, also announced an IPO of its tokenized shares back in September, claiming to be the first fully regulated stock exchange to list tokenized securities worldwide.

Equity Funding and STOs

Many analysts are speculating that equity funding will play a major role in the coming months, with angel investors seeking to seize a stake in the crypto businesses they bootstrap. An example of this theory in action is online investment platform Bnk To The Future, which saw 61% of investments made in crypto last year, including the launch of security tokens. Sony Financial Ventures also contributed to a $14.5 million funding round for Bitcoin bank Bitwala last summer, while Coinbase Ventures say they’ve invested in 60 crypto startups in the last few years. Binance, meanwhile, made nine outright acquisitions in 2019, and has promised several more in 2020. Accruing capital via crypto VCs, therefore, is fast becoming the norm.

But here’s the rub: whereas many ICOs and IEOs were propelled by relentless tsunamis of hype and hyperbole, seasoned investors are more likely to be lured by strong economic models, experienced teams and viable roadmaps. Venture funding is anything but high-yield, low-hanging fruit, and the era of VC blockchains – wherein early-stage investors claim heavily-discounted tokens then foist them on retail investors – appears to be coming to an end in the wake of failures like Hedera Hashgraph and Blockstack.

Speaking of strong economic models, Security Token Offerings (STOs) gained more attention and capital in 2019. Viewed as a regulatory-friendly fundraising model, STOs have been deployed across various industries including financial services and the energy sector. To date, the cryptosphere has witnessed over 60 STOs, which have collectively raised almost $1 billion. Expect this trend to continue over the next 12 months, even if STOs have yet to fully take off.

New Year, New Funding

Ultimately, the crypto projects of tomorrow will take funding where they can get it. Providing they can demonstrate real world utility and the potential for rapid growth, the capital won’t be difficult to source. It would be ambitious to suggest that startups can surpass 2018’s record of $21.6 billion in raised capital, but don’t expect the intriguing parade of projects rolling off the production line to let up.

Research published on December 23, incidentally, indicates that IEOs lost investors up to 98% of their money in 2019. On the basis of such evidence, it may be the case that initial exchange offerings are on their last legs – even if those legs could kick restlessly for some time yet. Crypto projects that can turn retail investors into early adopters, rather than long-term bagholders, are the ones destined to survive.

Benjamin Noys, a professor at the University of Chichester, in the UK, invented the term “accelerationism” for a philosophy that says technological progress should be greatly sped up.

In his book Malign Velocities: Accelerationism and Capitalism (Zero Books, 2014), Benjamin Noys defines accelerationism as the idea that capitalism should be pushed to ever-dizzying speeds to bring about a new future. Markets, technological progress and intelligence are all attributes of the same engine of history, which sometimes proceeds at the expense of humanity. Adherents argue the process of disrupting traditions, uprooting ecosystems and alienating individuals cannot be stopped. The only response is to accelerate.

Five years on, Noys is now looking to uncover the links between this fringe philosophy, which exists mostly online, and the emergence of internet-native currencies. I recently spoke with him by phone. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed what the alt-right sees in crypto, how accelerationism has entered mainstream discourse and the mystical experience of holding money.

Can you describe your research into cryptocurrency?

What interests me are the political aspects and debates around cryptocurrency, particularly in the way it’s been embraced by figures on the extreme right. I look at cryptocurrency as embodying a paradox. On the one hand it’s the most virtual form of money, entirely digital, and on the other hand it embodies stability in that it’s encrypted beyond government and other forms of interference. This dual perspective allows you to embrace both a desire for dissolving institutions and forms and embracing capitalism at its most extreme while preserving hierarchies between those who possess value and those who don’t.

How does a decentralized system preserve hierarchy?

Bitcoins are extremely deterritorialized, they belong to no one except their owners, and are not subject to any form of central control. This preserves the idea of value associated with those that possess monetary value. In some of the more extreme neo-reactionary movements, this hierarchy gets reinvented as the “the wealthy are better than the rest.” So those who embrace risk, speculation and the digital become the new lords or overlords.

It’s an argument by analogy? Because monetary hierarchies exist that validates other hierarchies – like racial or gender inequalities – for the extreme right.

Figures like Nick Land, and other neoreactionaries, do embrace or come close to embracing racialized positions, while at the same time hedging by saying ‘we only embrace pure capitalism.’ So they put a distance between themselves and traditional rightwing politics, but to me, they still embrace rightwing traditional values of racial and social hierarchies. It uses a hierarchy of value to dictate social value.

It seems like some of Nick Land’s support for bitcoin borders on the metaphysical. I was wondering if you’ve grappled with any of that?

I’m interested in the philosophical implications of crypto. There’s an argument that the birth of philosophy as a discipline runs parallel to the explosion of monetary economies in ancient Greece. That’s a speculative argument, but there are some interesting links between money as an abstract speculative medium and philosophy as an abstract speculative mode. That’s why I’m interested in how this particular form of digital currency aligns, can link with or generates political or social fantasies.

Are there larger societal implications of having censorship-resistant currencies?

We don’t know what the implications will be. This is what some people are celebrating. It’s an experiment and the consequences of the experiment are very unclear. The notion of currencies that are free from government or forms of social control offers many political possibilities. It doesn’t necessarily have to be rightwing or reactionary ones. At the moment, it’s interesting how the agenda of freedom from government tends to be pitched in a rightwing direction. Probably often by people that haven’t used cryptocurrencies. They’re kind of an object of fantasy.

Could you discuss how these reactionary ideas have entered into political discourse or wider culture?

Accelerationism is a broad church of different thinkers and ideas that emerged in the last ten or so years – obviously triggered by the financial crisis of 2008 and by the dominance of the internet – to try to deal with the question of how do we deal with technology today. The broad definition is the embrace or accelerate certain forms of technology or social reforms to push through our current capitalist state to a new future.

It can take left-wing forms, where a post-capitalist future would not be based on a current capitalist market but would still use current technologies like the internet to distribute wealth, or use cryptocurrencies to encourage a more egalitarian social order. And there are right-wing forms that want to accelerate capitalism into a purer form. There are also reactionary or even high-fascist forms: people who want a kind of combo between capitalism coupled with fascistic forms of authority.

Do you have an answer of how to appropriately deal with technology?

The irony is I’m a critic of accelerationism, but they have an answer: accelerate, engage more, speed things up. My answer is more critical or negative. We need to think through our approach to techno-social forms. But I don’t think my idea is to slow down or embrace technology. The answer isn’t to become a Luddite or an accelerationist.

Are you also critical of the idea that technological process is outside the control of humanity, like opening Pandora’s Box?

There have been ideas about singularities or technological determinism. Now it’s, “AI will realize itself whether we like it or not.” I’m critical of it, but we have given up a lot of potential ways in which we could control or manage or develop technologies. That’s part of the social context in which we work: These things are left to the quote-unquote market. There is a tendency to say we have no control, you just have to deal with the consequences of progress. That speaks to a limit of our political imagination. We can’t imagine taking control or regulating.

2020-01-05,"Crypto influencer John McAfee has sensationally backed down on his $1m Bitcoin bet, renouncing ‘ancient’ BTC in favour of Ethereum and Monero.

Presidential candidate, tax exile and crypto personality John McAfee has welched on his million dollar Bitcoin price prediction for 2020.

For those who came in late, the virus software pioneer McAfee had bet the price of Bitcoin would top $500,000 by 2020 or he’d “eat his own dick” on live television.

He later revised the prediction upwards to $1 million in light of Bitcoin “accelerating much faster than my model assumptions.”

But with 2020 dawning, and the price remaining stubbornly 95% below his prediction, he’s backing out of the bet.

This comes as no surprise – as McAfee himself said earlier today: “What idiot thinks anyone is going to eat their own dick, especially on TV?”

Renounces Bitcoin as “ancient technology”

But it’s the way McAfee has renounced Bitcoin along with the bet that’s upset some Bitcoin maximalists.

The crypto proponent called the original cryptocurrency “ancient technology” and suggested it was no more the future of crypto than the “piece of sh–” Model T was the future of the automobile.

Eat my dick in 12 months? A ruse to onboard new users. It worked. Bitcoin was first. It's an ancient technology. All know it. Newer blockchains have privacy, smart contracts, distributed apps and more. Bitcoin is our future? Was the Model T the future of the automobile? — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 5, 2020

While it was increasingly difficult to take McAfee’s predictions seriously – in October he said “If Bitcoin is less than $2 million by the end of 2020 then mathematics itself is a flawed disappointment” – there were plenty of people in the BTC community who at least enjoyed the hopium.

So which coins is McAfee backing now (and does it matter?)

Asked to follow up with his picks for best privacy coin and best smart contracts coin and McAfee picked Monero and Ethereum.

Let’s be clear – McAfee is throwing some serious shade at Bitcoin with the Model T comment.

When iHeart Radio host Matt Case tried to argue the Model T is now a “collectors car… it’s not a daily driver or practical for today but it sure went up in value” McAfee shot him down too.

“I’ve owned three. They are pieces of shit. A 1937 Auburn Speedster goes for over $10 million.”

McAfee’s tweet backing down on the bet was received with disgust by some.

Former senior market analyst at eToro, Mati Greenspan, said he was unfollowing McAfee.

Unfollowed. SMH https://t.co/L6p7buzSam — Mati Greenspan [tweets are not trading advice] (@MatiGreenspan) January 5, 2020

Bitcoin maximalist Tone Vays took a different tack, arguing there is zero “innovation difference between a 1917 Model T and a modern day Tesla.”

“In my view, we still drive the Model T today (it just has things like seat belts & gps added) Why is it so hard for @officialmcafee & many others to see #Bitcoin adding additional features?”

There is almost 0 innovation difference between 1917 Model T & Modern Day Tesla. In my view we still drive the Model T today (it just has things like seat belts & gps added) Why is it so hard for @officialmcafee & many others to see #Bitcoin adding additional features? https://t.co/ydK21gUuqv — Tone Vays [Vegas – Unconfiscatable.com] (@ToneVays) January 5, 2020

But McAfee’s “obsolete” call on Bitcoin had plenty of supporters too (admittedly most of them were using it to barrack for their favourite altcoins).

“There you have it folks, the colossal failure that Bitcoin is, is now being dumped by even the loudest most prolific bagholders. Get out before the Winklevosses capitulate,” wrote XRP fan Galgitron.

However, McAfee said he won’t be coming out as an XRP supporter any time soon.

On the subject of McAfee disavowing publicity stunts, you’ll be unsurprised to learn that his recent announcement he’ll be basing his presidential platform on anal fisting turns out not to be true either.

Last year was fun. I stretched things, yes. I finally based my platform on anal fisting, as many of you saw. For

Those who saw the humor: you're welcome:) But it's 2020 and time to get serious. Our country is in a world of hurt. My TRUE platform:https://t.co/HecxQtYY5h — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 5, 2020","Twelve major cryptocurrency exchange hacks occurred in 2019. Of these, 11 hacks resulted in the theft of cryptocurrency while one only involved stolen customer data. In total, $292,665,886 worth of cryptocurrency and 510,000 user logins were stolen from crypto exchanges in 2019. Cryptocurrency exchanges experienced more hacks last year than in 2018, when only nine cryptocurrency exchanges fell victim to security breaches.

As time goes on, you might think that cryptocurrency exchanges would become more secure. The reality, however, is that more hacks on cryptocurrency exchange are taking place year after year. In general, crypto exchanges remain unregulated, and it’s still unclear which regulatory agency has jurisdiction over the crypto markets.

Although there are no established rules regarding how cryptocurrency exchanges should safeguard customer funds, there are crypto-friendly countries and states. Canada, Malta and the American state of Wyoming have created crypto-friendly legislation that makes it easier for businesses to operate and gives them guidelines regarding security practices.

Sadly, not all countries have created guidelines or laws that help crypto businesses operate and reduce the risk for consumers. The way cryptocurrency exchanges store and protect their customer’s wealth differs from exchange to exchange; unfortunately, this makes cryptocurrency exchanges a hotbed for hacks that result in the theft of cryptocurrency or customer data. Let’s take a closer look at the cryptocurrency exchange hacks of 2019 and how much cryptocurrency, fiat and customer data was stolen in each incident.

1. Cryptopia

Date: Jan. 14, 2019

Headquarters: New Zealand

Amount stolen: $16,002,108

Just two weeks into the year, the first hack on a cryptocurrency exchange took place. New Zealand-based Cryptopia was hacked for over $16 million worth of cryptocurrency at the time. Social media users started their own investigation, according to which, over 20 different cryptocurrencies were taken from the exchange’s hot wallet.

2. LocalBitcoins

Date: Jan. 26, 2019

Headquarters: Finland

Amount stolen: $27,000

A few weeks later, the popular over-the-counter Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins was the victim of a security breach. Attackers were able to replace the official link to the exchange’s forum with a fraudulent link that led users to a fake page that resembled the discussion board but collected the information of the users who attempted to log in.

The attackers used the information they obtained to steal 7.9 Bitcoin — worth $27,000 at the time — from at least six user accounts.

3. Coinmama

Date: Feb. 15, 2019

Headquarters: Israel

Amount stolen: 450,000 account usernames and passwords

In just the second month of the year, Israel-based cryptocurrency broker Coinmama learned that its database had been breached. As a result, an estimated 450,000 user account logins and passwords had been compromised and posted on a darknet registry.

4. DragonEx

Date: March 24, 2019

Headquarters: Singapore

Amount stolen: $7.09 million

On March 24, Singapore-based exchange DragonEx posted in its official Telegram group that it had experienced a hacking attack, and as a result, a portion of the users’ and the platform’s crypto assets had been stolen. Days later, DragonEx released an announcement on its website, saying: “On March 24th, DragonEx suffered APT attack, which is the greatest challenge since DragonEx was first launched in the year of 2017. 7.09 million USDT assets are stolen.”

5. CoinBene

Date: March 25, 2019

Headquarters: Singapore

Amount stolen: $105 million

Just two days after the DragonEx hack, another cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore, CoinBene, was hacked. Many CoinBene users became suspicious of a hack when the CoinBene site unexpectedly went down for maintenance. Individuals who were tracking the CoinBene hot wallet noticed that a whopping $105 million worth of crypto assets had been removed. Even though all of the evidence is on the blockchain, CoinBene continues to deny that it was ever hacked.

6. Bithumb

Date: March 30, 2019

Headquarters: South Korea

Amount stolen: $18.7 million

March was a bad month for cryptocurrency exchanges. Just a few days after the CoinBene hack, Bithumb was hacked for an estimated $18.7 million — $12.5 million in EOS tokens and $6.2 million in XRP. Unlike other exchange hacks, Bithumb believed that the theft was an inside job committed by a former Bithumb employee who had access to its hot wallets.

7. Binance

Date: May 7, 2019

Headquarters: Malta

Amount stolen: $40 million

On May 7, Binance — the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange — experienced a security breach. As a result, 7,000 BTC, equivalent to $40 million at the time, was stolen. In addition, Binance said that hackers were able to obtain user API keys, two-factor authentication codes and possibly more user information.

Later, on Aug. 7, it was revealed that hackers were in possession of over 60,000 pieces of Know Your Customer data from the Binance exchange. An individual going by the name “Bnatov Platon” said he or she hacked the individuals that hacked Binance back in May and discovered that the original hackers had also gained access to 60,000 pieces of customer KYC data, including the photo IDs of 10,000 Binance users.

8. GateHub

Date: June 1, 2019

Headquarters: United Kingdom

Amount stolen: $10 million

In June, GateHub made an announcement, saying 100 of its users’ XRP wallets had been compromised. A GateHub community member took a deep dive into the hack and discovered that by June 5, 23,200,000 XRP had been stolen from 80–90 of these wallets — the equivalent to about $10 million at the time.

9. Bitrue

Date: June 26, 2019

Headquarters: Singapore

Amount stolen: $4.23 million

At the end of June, Bitrue was hacked, and roughly $4.23 million was stolen. Hackers learned of a vulnerability in Bitrue’s security that gave them access to about 90 user accounts. Afterward, hackers used what they learned from their 90-account takeover to successful compromise Bitrue’s hot wallet. As a result, 9.3 million XRP and 2.5 million ADA were stolen.

10. BITPoint

Date: July 11, 2019

Headquarters: Japan

Amount stolen: $32 million

On July 11, Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange BITPoint was alerted of an irregular outflow of XRP from its hot wallet. Several hours later, BITPoint became aware that Bitcoin, XRP, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litcoin had been moved from the exchange’s hot wallet without authorization. In total, $32 million worth of cryptocurrency was moved out of BITPoint’s hot wallet — $23 million of which belonged to BITPoint users.

11. VinDAX

Date: Nov. 5, 2019

Headquarters: Vietnam

Amount stolen: $500,000

For the most part, the VinDAX hack is a mystery. VinDAX is a small cryptocurrency exchange based in Vietnam that primarily hosts token offerings for unheard of companies. Information regarding this security breach is scarce. However, The Block took a deep dive into this mysterious hack and learned from the VinDAX support staff that roughly 23 cryptocurrencies — worth $500,000 in total — had been removed from its hot wallet without authorization.

12. Upbit

Date: Nov. 27, 2019

Headquarters: South Korea

Amount stolen: $49,116,778.00

And finally, the last hack of the decade: Upbit. Upbit is a South Korea based cryptocurrency exchange that was hacked for 342,000 ETH — equivalent to $49,116,778 at the time — on Nov. 27. All that is really known is that hackers were able to gain access to Upbit’s hot wallet and move Ether without authorization. However, Upbit released a statement shortly afterward telling users that it would be covering all of the losses with the exchange’s assets.

The damage

In total, $292,665,886 worth of cryptocurrency was stolen from 11 cryptocurrency exchanges and 510,000 pieces of user information were taken from the database of one exchange — a total of 12 cryptocurrency exchanges experienced security breaches.

So, what does this all mean? It means that cryptocurrency exchanges have to do better in terms of industry standards and security practices. Sadly, we did not see enough legislation and security improvement in 2019, and we experienced even more cryptocurrency exchange hacks than in any previous year. But hopefully, these things will change in 2020 and the cryptocurrency markets will be safer for every party involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.","Malta-based digital asset exchange Binance has announced that it will be supporting euro (EUR) trading against six major cryptocurrencies, as part of the global platform’s latest fiat-focused expansion.

According to Binance’s latest blog post, the exchange enabled trading for EUR pairs at 8am on January 3, 2020. Platform users can now trade EUR against Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP and Binance Coin (BNB).

Binance’s management mentioned that the global exchange will also enable trading against two widely-used stablecoins, which include Tether (USDT) and the platform’s own USD-pegged token, called Binance USD (BUSD).

Binance’s decision to add support for Euro trading has come after it enabled EUR deposits and withdrawals in November of last year. The exchange operator has also enabled similar services for the Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia and Kazakhstani tenge.

Binance provides EUR trading pairs on Binance Jersey, the exchange’s dedicated subsidiary, which was introduced in January 2019.

Euro trading will be available to digital currency traders on the exchange’s main platform, Binance.com. This option is not currently available on Binance US, the exchange’s US-based division.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao says that last year was like building the foundations of a house for the exchange.

Zhao noted:

“One of our key goals for 2020 is to bring crypto to the masses. For this, we aim to enable fiat-to-crypto trading for 180+ fiat currencies. We always have a number of strategic acquisition discussions in the works, a couple of them are major and will have a significant impact. We will announce it in due time.”

He added:","Bitcoin is set to have another halving on May 6, 2020. Despite a poor show in recent weeks, Bitcoin enthusiasts and experts are counting on halving for the price surge. While US Presidential candidate in exile and tech entrepreneur John McAfee had earlier predicted that Bitcoin will hit $1 Mn by 2020-end, investor Tim Draper appears to be more realistic in his prediction.

In a recent interview with The Daily Exchange, Draper predicted that Bitcoin would hit $250K by 2023. He said, “What I didn’t realize was that so many of the cryptocurrencies would be sort of marginalized, where they would lose their backing or the entrepreneur who was driving them, and that consolidates more of that activity around Bitcoin. So I actually think $250,000 may be a little bit light. It may actually be more like the beginning of 2023, but all systems seem to be ‘go’ for a real Bitcoin – a lot of excitement around Bitcoin.”

Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $7.3K.

Meanwhile, Australian scientist Craig Wright, the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto who claimed that Bitcoin won’t exist after December 31, 2019 due to a fatal flaw, has yet again been caught lying. The nChain developer was supposed to receive 1 Mn Bitcoin which would be worth $7 Bn, according to a Tulip Trust contract theory.

As of now, neither of two claims have come true.

What Is Bitcoin Halving?

Bitcoin halving is an inherent part of the technology behind Bitcoin. Essentially, to keep inflation under control, the Bitcoin protocol was programmed with a hard limit of 21 Mn BTCs, with new Bitcoins entering the system as an incentive for miners in a gradual and controlled rhythm. The Bitcoin creation rate is reduced by half every four years, which makes it harder to mine and reduces the reward for miners. The first halving occurred in November 2012, and then again in July 2016. The next reduction is expected in May 2020. after which the network incentives will be 6.25 Bitcoins per block.

The most obvious impact of halving is on the miners who get less for their efforts. For Bitcoin traders, the market is expected to be volatile in this period, with many casual investors likely to sell off Bitcoin.

Cryptocurrencies Have A Short Future, Says The Man Behind India’s Draft Crypto Bill

India’s former finance secretary and executive director of World Bank Subhash Chandra Garg, the man who chaired the Inter-Ministerial Committee which drafted the Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019) has now opened up about his view on cryptocurrencies in general.

After asserting his views about cryptocurrencies, currencies in general, Garg in his blog wrote, “I am convinced that private cryptocurrencies would have a very short future. However, some people will make profits and a lot of gullible people would lose. It is generally the small persons who suffer. If today’s valuation is anywhere close to $200 Bn, the cryptocurrency magic must have made some billionaires, obviously at the cost of a lot of people who have purchased these essentially worthless codes.”

Reading the article, it seems that Garg has tried to explain the currencies and payments from the existing conventional practices followed world over. Cryptocurrencies, however, need to be looked from a different perspective.

This is important as and when paper currencies and coins were first introduced in China, people had little faith in that. Similarly, during American Civil war counterfeit notes were rampant. It took the US Treasury department a decade to prevent counterfeiting.

The need of the hour is to look cryptocurrencies from a fresh angle. The law should be made in order to prevent the wrongdoings associated with the technology and not the technology itself.

Justin Sun To Donate $1 Mn to Greta Thunberg

TRON founder and BitTorrent CEO Justin Sun in a tweet pledged to donate $1 Mn to environment activist Greta Thunberg to help raise global awareness of the climate crisis.

Sun also advocated that increased use of cryptocurrencies will help reduce the carbon footprints.

Sun later told Cointelegraph,

“Decentralized settlement and decentralized finance are completely run by computers on cloud computing systems, thus eliminating the need for ledger documentation and management records kept on paper.”

On Bitcoin consuming huge energy, Sun said that it is based on Proof-of-Work, instead of PoW, Proof-of-Stake could be adopted to reduce the energy consumption in crypto.

Binance Futures Trading Platform Launches Isolated Margin Mode

Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange Binance recently launched an isolated margin mode on the Binance Futures trading platform. The new feature will help traders allocate a precise amount of margin for an open position and isolate it from all other open positions, reducing potential losses in case the market goes against an open position and allowing for overall better risk management.

With this isolated margin mode, traders can execute different strategies across various open positions, with the aim of further increasing potential profits and reducing losses. The cross margin mode will be retained on Binance Futures to provide traders with more options.

Binance launched its futures trading platform last September with a cross margin mode, providing traders with a platform to hedge positions and manage risk. To date, Binance Futures has launched BTC contracts with max leverage of 125x, the highest among major crypto exchanges, as well as ETH and BCH contracts with max leverage of 75x.","Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said that he believes a “privacy coin” will go mainstream in the 20s.

In a post published on Coinbase’s official blog on Jan. 3, Armstrong said that he believes in the 20s we will see the integration of privacy features into one of the major blockchains. He also foresees a cryptocurrency with such features to go mainstream in the following years:

“Just like how the internet launched with HTTP, and only later introduced HTTPS as a default on many websites, I believe we’ll eventually see a “privacy coin” or blockchain with built in privacy features get mainstream adoption in the 2020s.”

Crackdown on anoncoins

Armstrong’s predictions are interesting given the recent crackdown on privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and the apparent consensus that privacy should be one of the main focuses of Bitcoin (BTC) development.

In March, the head of the Finance Committee of France’s National Assembly proposed a ban of so-called anoncoins. In May, Japanese exchange Coincheck delisted four privacy coins and the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association recommended that its members do the same. All of that makes Armstrong’s prediction that a privacy-focused cryptocurrency will reach mainstream adoption surprising.

Major cryptos work on privacy

When it comes to the integration of privacy features in major blockchains, some may argue that the process has already started. As Cointelegraph reported in June, some fear that Bitcoin’s increasing anonymity may be a threat to anoncoins.

For instance, blockchain technology firm Blockstream published test code for using Schnorr signatures on the Bitcoin blockchain in February 2019, which aids with the privacy on the network while also increasing the scalability. Discussions on possible implementation are still ongoing.

Ethereum’s blockchain, on the other hand, in September 2017 added support for zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-Proofs), a particular type of cryptography that allows for the validation of data without access to it.

At the end of October 2018, multinational auditing and consulting firm Ernst & Young announced the launch of its prototype implementation of ZK-Proofs on the public Ethereum blockchain.

As Cointelegraph illustrated in a recent analysis, privacy in crypto is a contentious topic. The reason is that some believe privacy to be a fundamental prerequisite for peace of mind and security, while others are of the idea that anonymity is useful only to criminals.

The “billionaire flippening”

Furthermore, Armstrong also notes that a majority of the world’s billionaires will come from the cryptocurrency space in the 20s. He said:

“My friends Olaf Carlson-Wee and Balaji Srinivasan estimate that at a price of $200,000 per Bitcoin, more than half the world’s billionaires will be from cryptocurrency.”

As a consequence, he believes that the amount of capital invested in science and technology will increase and more people from the cryptocurrency industry will turn to philanthropy.

As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, this last prediction is in line with a report compiled by digital asset management firm Coinshares, which estimates that Bitcoin aware Millennials are set to inherit almost $70 trillion of value from the Baby Boomer generation by 2045.","Share this article

Large pools are causing centralization.



Cardano’s largest pools are currently over-staked. Though the exact statistics change over time, the issue has been observed for several weeks. AdaPools.org indicates that 18 of Cardano’s 249 active staking pools are saturated as of Jan. 4. In terms of value, 33% of all staked ADA has been allocated to just 7% of active pools.

IOHK considers pools with more than 1% of all staked funds to be saturated. “Beyond this, rewards are shared with fewer people and the pool becomes less desirable,” IOHK has noted on Twitter. Users who fail to switch to less saturated pools earn lower rewards—an incentive that is designed to keep pools from becoming centralized.

Saturation Smaller Than It Seems

Though Cardano has several large pools, the majority of Cardano’s pools are not over-staked. AdaPools.org ranks each pool by the amount of ADA that it has staked, so by definition, it lists the most saturated pools first. It is not clear if users are flocking to certain pools deliberately, of if saturation is just an incidental outcome.

Surprisingly, pools that offer low fees and high rewards do not appear to be particularly saturated, despite the fact that they should be very attractive to staking participants. However, pools run by Cardano ambassadors and IOHK itself seem to be attracting a lot of staked value, perhaps because of their official nature.

Despite the fact that pools are saturated, Cardano has a large network that has the potential to be more decentralized. The project has attracted hundreds of active pools, and users have staked 9.5 billion ADA on the testnet. It is possible that the network will grow even larger when Cardano launches staking on its Shelley mainnet later this year.

Can The Problem Be Solved?

Changes to staking are clearly needed. Cardano may need to tweak incentives to encourage movement between pools. Pool listing sites may need to sort pools in a way that makes unsaturated pools more visible. Users have also requested saturation alerts and automatic pool switching, two features that could make staking easier.

Though Cardano staking is relatively simple, it seems that the process will not be as simple as “set it and forget it.” Over-staking has been a long-running issue on other blockchains that rely on similar delegation-based staking systems, such as Tezos. If the pattern exists, there may be no easy solution to saturation for some blockchains.","Travala Scores 33% Revenue Growth With 60% of Bookings Paid With Crypto

Over 1,500 Rooms Booked in December

Rooms booked via the Travala.com website have been steadily rising throughout 2019, crossing another milestone last month, the travel agency announced in its most recent monthly report. The total number reached 1,528 in December, which represents a more than 15% increase over November, when 1,326 room nights were booked. The overall booking revenue was up 33.5% month-on-month, the document details. Besides the increase in bookings, the average price per room night also went up – from $97 in October and $115 in November to $133 in the last month of 2019, when the bookings peaked.

The report also shows that more than 60% of all Travala bookings in December were paid using cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin core (BTC) topping the list with 28%, followed by the platform’s native AVA token with over 9%. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is a close third with 8% of all bookings. Ethereum (ETH) accounts for 4% and Binance coin and dash each have 3%. Monero (XMR) was used in 2% of the cases, while the total of payments with other cryptocurrencies amounted to 6%. Fiat transactions with credit cards and Paypal had a 37% share.

Travala’s crypto payment gateway accepts multiple cryptocurrencies, also including XRP, LTC, TRX, NAN, XRB, ADA, DAI, and TUSD, allowing crypto enthusiasts to pay for its services with their favorite digital coin. The platform’s AVA token, based on the NEO network, is used to fuel its Smart discount and loyalty program which provides up to 10% savings on hotel and other accommodation bookings for users of the Travala.com wallet. A total of 2,305,000 AVA, close to 5% of the circulating supply, is locked within the Smart program which already has 550 members.

2 Million Hotels and Accommodations Offered

Travala.com currently offers customers the opportunity to book rooms in over 2,000,000 hotels and accommodations worldwide, including luxury resorts, apartments, villas, and hostels.

Bricks and mortar shops began to struggle as soon as ecommerce started to gain traction. Today, online shopping has become the norm for many consumers. It is estimated that globally, over 1.9 billion people have made online purchases in 2019. Conversely, thousands of physical stores are experiencing a drop in sales, which has led to store closures and even bankruptcies. Analysts have coined this phenomenon the “retail apocalypse.”

In this article, we will discuss this trend and the potential role that digital currencies could play in a predominantly digital retail market.

What is the ""retail apocalypse""?

The “retail apocalypse” refers to the close of physical stores in the U.S. (especially of larger chains) as a result of changing consumer behavior and the rise of ecommerce.

The term “retail apocalypse” first appeared in 2017 following the closure of a large number of bricks and mortar stores by major retailers as well as several high-profile retail bankruptcies.

Analysts at the investment bank UBS predict that an estimated 75,000 shops that sell consumer electronics, furniture, and clothing will close their doors by 2026. At that point, ecommerce is expected to make up around 25% of retail sales.

In the list of major retailers that have closed hundreds of physical stores reads like the who’s who of American retail. Radio Shack (1,470 store closures), Toys R Us (735 store closures), and GNC (700 store closures) are examples of retailers who have suffered as a result of the “retail apocalypse.” Since 2017, over 15,000 bricks and mortar shops have been closed, according to UBS.

As the world goes digital, it is hard to envision a future where online shopping does not make up a majority of retail sales. Nationwide same-day drone delivery (and probably also returns) are estimated to become the norm while consumers are spending more time in front of screens than ever.

The question for cryptocurrency advocates, users, and investors is whether decentralized digital currencies could end up as one of the major beneficiaries of the retail apocalypse or not.

Crypto and “retail apocalypse”?

Despite the many benefits that cryptocurrency has as an online payment system, bitcoin (BTC) has not managed to successfully penetrate the online retail market in the first decade of its existence. While there are several online retailers that accept bitcoin, the list is much shorter than the list of retailers who accept PayPal, for example.

The reasons why bitcoin has not (yet) managed to succeed as a transactional currency for online payments is partly due to its volatility but mainly because of bitcoin users’ strong propensity to “HODL,” or reluctance to spend cryptocurrency hoping it will rise in value. The lack of major retailers that accept the digital currency is, of course, another factor why mainstream adoption as a payment method is still years away.

However, the retail apocalypse may change that.

As shoppers move online and cryptocurrency adoption increases across the globe, the coming years could see more crypto-holding consumers make online purchases using digital currency. Should the option to pay in digital currency become more readily available, we could expect more cryptocurrency use among online shoppers.

“It sure will. Crypto is an excellent use-case for online payments specifically,” Yousef Abdulhassan, founder and CEO of the crypto-powered ecommerce platform CoinMall, told Cryptonews.com.

Meanwhile, Dylan Bathurst, founder of the Lightning Network-powered get-paid-for-your-data app Trakkin.me, says he does not believe in the retail apocalypse.

“I think it’s just kind of a generational shift to online, but then people will want an in-person experience and move back to offline. But I do think online shopping will eventually dominate. Bitcoin indirectly benefits from that being that there are just more online payments happening, there will be more bitcoin payments happening,” Bathurst told Cryptonews.com, adding that bitcoin itself is still in a store of value stage now and will be for a while.

However, according to him, as Lightning Network develops, we’re seeing new and interesting use cases for bitcoin and “I think the future is bright there.”

Bitcoin or stablecoins?

Perhaps the bigger question than whether crypto will benefit from the “retail apocalypse” or not is whether it will be “real” cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or fiat-currency pegged stablecoins that will win the race to become the go-to online spending digital currency.

While bitcoin (and altcoin) users are faced with price volatility and a reluctance by retailers to accept crypto as a payment method, fiat currency-backed stablecoins may end up leading the pack of digital spending currencies as businesses are already comfortable with accepting fiat currency in digital form.

CoinMall CEO Abdulhassan disagrees.

“The most liquid and most widely adopted coin will win, which currently is bitcoin. I don't think that'll change any time soon either, since buyers don't want to go through the hassle of exchanging their BTC to whichever other coin just to make a payment,” he said.

Meanwhile, according to Bathurst, stablecoins still have a lot of the same challenges bitcoin has in terms of user onboarding (get a wallet, sign transactions, etc).

“So, I really don’t see them as helping ecommerce but, instead, as a way of helping people with large crypto holdings to hedge market volatility,” he said.

It is difficult to predict to what extent more shoppers moving online will impact cryptocurrency adoption and usage. While online shopping provides an excellent use case for digital currencies, they are yet to reach critical mass as an online payment method.

Having said that, bitcoin has gone a long way in just one decade. So, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if it eventually ends up as one of the go-to digital payment options.

The report by International Investment claims that the Qatari Financial Regulator released a statement saying, “Virtual Asset Services may not be conducted in or from the QFC at this time.”

The Qatar Financial Center (QFC) is financial sector located in the Doha that provides legal and business infrastructure for financial services. According to the report, the ban was quite comprehensive, banning “anything of value that acts as a substitute for currency that can be digitally traded or transferred and can be used for payment or investment purposes.”

The watchdog purportedly extends the ban to any exchange between cryptos and fiat currencies or between two cryptos. It also outlaws the transfer of cryptos, the custody and administration of cryptos and any financial instruments tied to cryptos. Additionally, it prohibits the “participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer’s offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.”

Digital forms of securities as well as the other financial instruments under the purview of the watchdog or the Qatar Central Bank are still legal.

The Qatar Financial Markets Regulator has yet to release a statement regarding the ban.

The ban comes at a time when the other Middle Eastern countries are trying to fortify their positions as crypto hubs. Bahrain is working to remove all restrictions for crypto firms, making it easy to set up a crypto firm in the country. As CoinGeek reported, setting up a crypto firm in Bahrain will cost you around $200,000, much lower than in places like London and New York where the cost is over $750,000.

Bahrain also saw the establishment of the first regulated on-shore crypto exchange in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Known as Rain, the exchange is backed by global giant Bittrex and has already raised $2.5 million to set up and expand its operations.

The UAE, on the other hand, is home to three crypto exchanges. One of these, MidChains, has received the backing of Mubadala, a state-owned investment company.

The ban from Qatar is quite a surprise, especially given that the country was one of the attendants in a recent meeting between Muslim leaders that called for a Muslim crypto. The calls for a Muslim crypto were led by Iran, with Malaysia and Turkey being among the other attendants.

Bitcoin may be drawing haven demand on U.S.-Iran tensions, according to prominent analysts, and could soon confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart with a UTC close above $7,580.

A daily chart indicator is reporting the strongest bullish bias in two months. A breakout would create room for at least a $1,000 rally.

A failure to hold above today's low of $7,342 would weaken the case for a breakout.

Bitcoin is drawing bids amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty and could soon rise above key resistance at $7,580, confirming a short-term bullish breakout.

The top cryptocurrency is currently trading at $7,530, representing a 1 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Prices are now up nearly 10 percent from lows near $6,850 registered during the Asian trading hours on Friday.

Notably, the cryptocurrency picked up a bid at lows near $6,850 after the U.S. launched an airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport, killing top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.

Tensions escalated over the weekend, with Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promising revenge and President Trump warning Tehran against retaliatory actions.

Through all this, bitcoin remained bid and hit a two-week high of $7,580 earlier Monday.

Hence, many in the investor community think the U.S.-Iran tensions are powering gains in bitcoin. After all, the cryptocurrency is considered as digital gold by the likes of Michael Novogratz, the founder of the cryptocurrency asset management firm Galaxy Digital. Novogratz tweeted on Sunday:

Backing Novogratz’s view is popular trader Holger Zchaepitz, who expects bitcoin and gold to continue rising on the back of tensions in the Middle East.

While Novogratz and Zchaepitz consider bitcoin a safe haven, trader Ran NeuNer believes the cryptocurrency is still an uncorrelated asset and could be the best hedge against risk intensification.

With the safe-haven narrative strengthening, bitcoin looks set to scale resistance at $7,580.

Daily chart

Bitcoin is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart (Bitstamp prices). A UTC close above $7,580 would confirm the breakout (a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change) and open the doors for $8,735 (target as per the measured move method).

The breakout looks likely, with the 14-day relative strength index hovering at a two-month high of 56.00. A reading above 50 indicates bullish conditions.

Weekly chart

The long-tails attached to the hammer candle created in the seven days to Dec. 22 and the last week’s doji candle indicate seller exhaustion and support the case for a breakout on the daily chart.

Even so, the bulls are cautioned against being too ambitious, as prominent analysts like @BitBitCrypto and Peter Schiff think the cryptocurrency has rallied since Friday due to speculators buying on the hope that bitcoin will attract haven demand from traditional investors.

So, an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout could end up trapping bulls on the wrong side of the market or may remain elusive if that flow dries up.

A failure to hold above today’s low of $7,342 would validate the bearish view put forward by the descending 10-week moving average and likely yield a re-test of $6,850.","The cryptocurrency world isn’t exactly known for its customer service. In fact, the difficulty and dangers of using the platforms are one of the core drawbacks for many people thinking about entering the crypto market. But, there are some cryptocurrency exchanges that offer 24/7 support for their customers. Here, we’ll examine if this feature is really necessary for the age of digital currencies and whether you should pick a crypto exchange that offers it.

Customer Support in the Cryptocurrency World

The history of customer support in cryptocurrency has been pretty terrible. Perhaps the most famous event was the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange attack that saw over $400 million in customer funds stolen. The company response after the attack was not handled well, and many customers and investors never got their money back. The exchange closed its doors after the attack.

The rise of decentralized exchanges has made this even worse. Most decentralized Bitcoin exchanges don’t have any customer support at all. All trades are executed automatically on the blockchain. This is a great technological achievement, but often it leaves people in a lot of trouble.

What Can Go Wrong

When using a cryptocurrency exchange, there are a few scenarios where a lack of customer support can catch you out. The first is when something goes wrong on the exchange. Be it a technical problem, an attack, or a theft. When this happens, the exchanges with a weak customer support system are slow to react and get customers up and running again. This can mean losing access to your funds for days, weeks, or even forever.

It’s also very easy to make a mistake as a cryptocurrency exchange customer. Mistyped keys, and incorrect sending addresses can mean that you send your cryptocurrency to the wrong place. On an exchange with no customer support, this means you will lose it forever. Losing your login credentials is also a possibility and could mean you lose access to everything.

With no customer support, you can easily find yourself in trouble with no obvious solution. This is a problem for all crypto traders, but it’s especially worrying for beginners.

Things happen quickly in the cryptocurrency world. If you send your coins to the wrong place or make a mistake, the time to fix the issue will likely be very limited. Cryptocurrency exchanges that offer excellent customer support can rapidly resolve these issues and make sure you’re back in control of your money and trading again as soon as possible.

How Many Exchanges Have 24/7 Support?

There are now countless cryptocurrency exchanges available, but not many of them offer genuine around-the-clock support. The ones that do are often centralized Bitcoin exchanges with large customer bases that are trying to build a strong brand. Here are some examples of cryptocurrency exchanges that offer 24-hour customer support.

CEX.IO

CEX.IO is a cryptocurrency exchange that prides itself on its strong customer support. It has support staff available 24 hours a day to answer questions and help with problems. The exchange also has a history of taking care of customers and their funds. The CEX.IO help center is where you can search community forums, submit support tickets, search FAQs and suggest future features for the exchange.

Support on CEX.IO is available via email and phone. Overall, CEX.IO is a solid choice for beginner cryptocurrency traders, even those who decided to buy bitcoin for the first time and looking for an exchange with great customer support.

Coinbase

Coinbase is another exchange with distinguished support for customers. Coinbase has a searchable support database for quick self-serve problem solving, as well as 24/7 phone support and email support. Coinbase puts a lot of effort into improving their customer experience. This has led to them becoming one of the most popular crypto exchange in the world for beginners and experienced traders.

The downside of this excellent customer experience is the cost. Trading on Coinbase is more expensive than on other exchanges, particularly using the Bitcoin buy/sell feature. The range of available cryptocurrencies is also limited.

Kraken

Kraken also offers global 24/7/365 customer support. The difference with Kraken to the exchanges mentioned above is that it is live chat support. That means that you won’t be able to hop on the phone, but you’ll open a chat window instead. They say their customer service representatives offer support for a wide array of languages, too. This support team is supported by a library of FAQs and documentation.

Changelly

Changelly is another widely-known cryptocurrency exchange that provides its users with 24/7 live support. The service is run by highly competent and friendly support staff, but that’s not the only aspect of Changelly’s support system that has given the platform its reputation as one of the most client-oriented exchanges out there. The around the clock service is backed up with an informative FAQ, a detailed exchange crash course and many other useful tips & features.

This extra attention to detail has definitely helped put Changelly at the forefront of the easiest-to-use and most reliable crypto exchanges.

An Incentive to Deliver Better Service

Exchanges that offer extensive customer service take on a considerable expense to deliver a better experience to their customers. Every phone call, support ticket, or chat window costs the company money in wages. This has the knock-on effect of improving the operations of the exchanges that invest in this. There is a substantial financial incentive to reduce the number of customer support calls to increase profit margins, so these exchanges also invest heavily in ensuring their product user experience is phenomenal.

Exchanges that don’t offer a high level of customer support don’t have that same incentive. It simply doesn’t immediately cost them much money when a customer can’t solve a problem.

24/7 Support Is Worth It for Beginners

When getting started with cryptocurrency trading, there are so many things that can go wrong. The technology is immature, and the methods are unfamiliar. This means there will inevitably be problems. With cryptocurrency, problems often mean a loss of your hard-earned money.

When you choose an exchange that values its customers and invests heavily in customer support, you’re reducing this risk significantly. The customer-centric exchanges mentioned here, and a few others are quite rare in the crypto world.

There are many factors you should consider when choosing a crypto exchange. But if it comes down to a choice between one with a tried and tested 24/7 customer support team and one without, always select the one with better support. You’ll see why when something goes wrong.

READ: The Changes in Crypto Regulations Across the World in 2019","DRAPER — Make no mistake, when it comes to nationwide mandatory annual tax filings, the Internal Revenue Service believes cryptocurrencies are most assuredly a thing.

And Utah tech startup TaxBit on Monday announced $5 million in new funding to continue growing its innovative software platform that’s aiming to help the growing number of cryptocurrency users and investors stay in good graces with the U.S. government’s tax collection agency.

Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and ethereum, are internet-based mediums of exchange that use encrypted functions to conduct financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies have grown substantially since first appearing in 2009 and current estimates indicate there are over 2,300 different currencies being traded and used.

Starting with the 2019 tax year, the ubiquitous IRS “long form” 1040 includes the following question: “At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”

The simple inquiry leaves little to either imagination or interpretation and filers should know the IRS is expecting anyone who has had any financial dealings that involved the digital currencies, built on decentralized blockchain technology, is on the hook to detail those transactions and any subsequent financial gains or loses related to their use.

TaxBit co-founder and CEO Austin Woodward said the days of cryptocurrencies being too esoteric to earn the attention of taxing entities are well gone as an estimated 17 million or so Americans are dabbling in the digital currencies and Utah is among the top five states for per capita users.

“There’s been a misconception that crypto was untraceable and a vehicle for hiding income or evading taxes ... which really is not the case,” Woodward said. “What the reporting requirements are, and what you’re liable for in your filings, has been a point of confusion ... and the reporting can be very complicated.”

Woodward said TaxBit alleviates that confusion and was built to be the “TurboTax for crypto.” The platform, he said, syncs easily with a user’s digital wallet or crypto exchange account and automates the reporting process by pulling in necessary data and completing required tax reports.

TaxBit launched a year ago and while its main product is focused on individuals with cryptocurrency tax obligations, it has also created an enterprise product to assist crypto exchanges and merchants on the commercial side of the transaction universe.

The company’s $5 million seed fund included investments from TTV Capital, Valar Ventures, Dragonfly Capital Partners, Collaborative Fund, Winklevoss Capital, Global Founders Capital, Table Management and local venture capital firm Album VC which previously led TaxBit’s pre-seed funding round.

Winklevoss Funding is one of the efforts launched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the identical twins and former Harvard students made famous in the film “Social Network” about Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and the genesis of the social media behemoth. The Winklevoss’ reportedly leveraged $65 million in settlement money from a lawsuit filed against Zuckerberg to enter the cryptocurrency markets.

Sterling Witzke, partner at Winklevoss Capital, said TaxBit’s reporting solution will help alleviate a burden that has been a barrier for some interested in engaging with cryptocurrency.

“Navigating cryptocurrency tax laws is a byzantine process,” Witzke said in a statement. “TaxBit’s technology eliminates this confusion and complexity by allowing crypto owners to seamlessly understand the full picture of their tax liability through an intuitive and easy-to-use platform.

“Solving for this pain point is integral to accelerating cryptocurrency adoption, and we are thrilled to back TaxBit on this mission.”","2020 could well be the year that the cryptocurrency dream dies. This is not to say that cryptocurrencies will die altogether – far from it. But to all the financial romantics who have cheered the rise of bitcoin and other digital currencies over the past decade, there is a reckoning coming. Like it or not, the vision of a world in which these currencies liberate money from the clutches of central banks and other corporate giants is fading rapidly.

It is not that these currencies have no place in the future of money. The encrypted blockchain technology that underpins them is extremely difficult for governments to control, so it is unlikely that they will ever be eliminated. In any case, they have a valid role to play as a geopolitical hedge – witness the surge in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies after the latest escalation in tensions between the US and Iran, for instance.

But 11 years on from bitcoin’s remarkable beginnings, cryptocurrencies are a long way from supplanting the financial system. At the time of writing, the total value of all the bitcoin in circulation is US$133 billion (£102 billion); in comparison, the market value of all the world’s gold is around US$8 trillion, while the total worth of mainstream currencies worldwide is roughly the same again.

No new hope

The so-called bitcoin maximalists foresee a day when their currency of choice rises into the top league. They point to the bitcoin “halvening” expected in May – the moment every four years when the number of new coins being added to the network is halved – as the next event that will drive prices up.

Yet the long-term prospect for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is stasis on the peripheries of the financial system. The chances of a new bitcoin look increasingly slim: it’s several years since ethereum rose to become the prime challenger, before falling back to a fraction of the bitcoin price (click on the chart below to make it bigger).

Bitcoin vs altcoins

More importantly, a much bigger threat to the current system is afoot – as evidenced by Facebook’s attempts to get its libra digital currency off the ground. JP Morgan has already launched a JPM coin for major institutional clients, while numerous other major banks are set to follow suit. Other tech giants like Amazon, Google and Apple are rumoured to be looking at launching rival currencies as well.

Their model is what are known as stablecoins – a sort of crypto hybrid that lives on blockchains but is pegged to mainstream currencies. But aside from this connection to the status quo, these multinationals would be challenging sovereign money. They want to opt out of the clunky system that they have been forced to operate in, with its transaction fees and international payment delays, to present customers with an alluring alternative instead.

The reason these companies are not throwing their weight behind bitcoin et al is because today’s cryptocurrencies have at least as many drawbacks as the mainstream system. Their prices are too volatile to act as a serious store of value, for instance, while their ability to process financial transactions is not yet particularly impressive.

It has dawned on the corporate giants that as per their products or services, they can make money part of their brand – part of the customer experience. Sell people goods and services, yes, but also offer them a new monetary system to take care of the purchases. It begins to look like almost total control.

The empire strikes back

The state has been late to wake up to this challenge, but has now done so in a powerful and surprising way. The traditional global infrastructure has proved strong enough to derail the corporates at least temporarily with red tape. Yet make no mistake – the goalposts have completely changed, and it will be difficult to present a united regulatory front around the world. Ironically, it is the same lack of global uniform regulatory approval for the existing cryptocurrencies that has hindered their meaningful adoption.

The other response under examination is to launch state cryptocurrencies. The likes of China and Russia are in pole position to launch the first within a couple of years. Deutsche Bank recently published a report suggesting that cryptocurrencies could overtake national fiat currencies within ten years, envisaging that these state-backed versions will lead the charge.

In short, the future of cryptocurrency lies in either corporate or sovereign digital coins – or more likely, an uneasy cohabitation of the two. The system supposedly under threat from bitcoin and the other so-called bank killers is instead assimilating them. The coins that emerge maybe won’t even use blockchains, acting more akin to Paypal or WeChat Pay than as cryptocurrencies as we know them.

Where the previous half century saw the rise of corporates to a size and influence comparable to nation states, the next half century could produce a new paradigm in which they increasingly behave like nation states. When we reflect on the way these companies already manage our data, the way they exert lobbying influence on our governments, the trend is clearly well underway. Call it the next phase of globalisation.

Money in 2030 will probably therefore be almost unrecognisable compared to what we use today. The dream of universal people-powered monetary substitutes is being crushed by this unanticipated but in hindsight inevitable institutionalisation. It is from within the multinational world that the “next bitcoin” will emerge – wrapped in the liveries of a corporate brand, if not a sovereign flag. As for the great dream of bitcoin liberation, may it rest in peace.","Turkey Prepares to Increase Oversight in the Crypto Space

Turkish authorities, alarmed by the spread of cryptocurrencies in the country, are reportedly ramping up efforts to introduce greater oversight into the sector. Local media revealed that regulators are under pressure to increase supervision in 2020 because of the growing popularity of decentralized crypto assets among Turks.

Authorities Ask Market Watchdog to Develop Regulations

The Capital Markets Board of Turkey (CMB), the supervisory agency responsible for the securities market, is speeding up the development of mechanisms for stricter regulation of the cryptocurrency space. According to a report published by Hürriyet, a leading Turkish daily, the regulatory push comes in response to indicators showing that the share of cryptocurrency owners in Turkey is among the highest in the world.

A figure quoted by the newspaper places the country at the top of such rankings. Turkey has an estimated 1 million investors, the article notes, who have embraced the new digital assets since the rapid rise of their value in 2017. A fifth of Turkish respondents in last year’s Global Consumer Survey by Statista said they used or owned crypto, as news.Bitcoin.com reported in June. The country has a population of around 82 million.

Currently, Turkey has no specific regulations in place for digital financial assets, which has raised concerns among officials about the risks crypto investors are facing. Hürriyet claims that public authorities have asked the CMB to prepare the necessary supervisory measures and since the beginning of the year regulators have scrambled to quickly respond to this request.

The Turkish government fears that cryptocurrencies can be used for manipulative purposes. A source quoted by the daily stated that such risks have accumulated and are the main reason for the decision to examine crypto assets more closely and increase control over intermediaries operating in the space. The move has been described as a preventive step.

Turkey Becoming a Crypto Hotspot

Turkey is not the only country in the region that’s still pondering how to deal with cryptocurrencies. Many other nations, most EU member states, for example, lack regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Numerous questions persist such as what is bitcoin from a legal standpoint, how to tax crypto-related incomes and profits, how to monitor crypto transactions and protect the interests of investors. Some governments have already tightened controls over the industry even before adopting comprehensive regulations.

Meanwhile, Turkey has gradually become a crypto hotspot for various reasons, including excessive inflation of the nation’s fiat currency, the lira, and the freezing of millions of bank accounts last year. Global crypto platforms have actively sought to establish a presence in the Turkish market. Binance recently introduced support for the Turkish lira and announced a partnership with a local payment processor to allow Turks to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with local currency. Earlier in 2019, the leading Eastern European crypto exchange Exmo registered a Turkish subsidiary and revealed plans to open a permanent office in the country.

The Turkish government, whose relations with Western allies have been deteriorating over the past few years, intends to also issue a national digital currency amid threats for sanctions. The project to develop a “blockchain-based” lira has been included in Recep Erdogan’s Annual Presidential Program released in early November. Tests of the new sovereign coin are expected to begin in 2020. The Turkish leadership plans to further develop the fintech ecosystem as well and establish a dedicated financial center in Istanbul, the country’s economic capital.

Bitcoin's price jumped $200 in an hour and a half on Monday, rising to a 30-day high of $7,800.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization climbed after data provider CoinMarketCap showed a sudden jump in the supply of stablecoin tether (USDT).

The 5 percent rise in bitcoin’s (BTC) price initially appeared to be preceded by a $500 million increase in USDT’s market capitalization, from around $4.14 billion at 20:49 UTC to $4.65 billion at 20:54 UTC.

Tether’s treasury website currently reads a value of $4,776,470,463.76 in total assets, securing $4,656,898,280.75 of liabilities.

However, archived versions of the page show similar readings over the past few days, suggesting CoinMarketCap’s data did not capture the full supply previously. USDT runs on several different blockchain networks, including Omni, ethereum, Tron and Liquid.

Traders can deposit U.S. dollars with Tether Ltd., the issuer of USDT, and receive the stablecoin in return. Since USDT is pegged 1:1 to the dollar and is used to move money quickly between crypto exchanges, a swelling of its market cap could have been interpreted as an increase in demand for digital assets.

It remains unclear, then, exactly why bitcoin jumped late Monday. Talks surrounding BTC’s use case as a safe haven asset are dominating investor channels amid the backdrop of the Iran/US tensions that have been ongoing since Jan. 3.

At the time of writing the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is up 0.25 percent while the S&P 500 (SPX) is up 0.35 percent. Crude oil (USOIL) has taken a small hit and is down 0.35 percent so the narrative of BTC being a safe haven asset during times of uncertainty remains unclear at this stage.

Other major cryptos such as ether and XRP are up significantly by 5.76 and 11.18 percent respectively.

Fake volume became one of crypto assets’ leading narratives of 2019, as a U.S. regulatory application for an exchange-traded product (ETP) followed the work of earlier researchers in showing how as much as 95 percent of lit markets’ reported bitcoin trading volume might be fake. That’s resulted in conservative estimates of bitcoin volume that are probably far too low, and a condition of uncertainty as to how much bitcoin is actually being traded.

You could think of fake volume as a natural feature of crypto’s novel market structure, in which:

liquidity is divided among many competing exchange venues

trading fees are high relative to other asset categories

exchanges provide data for free

In crypto markets, data is a marketing tool instead of a revenue source, and some exchanges have been shown to use it that way, exaggerating volumes in order to enhance their perceived liquidity.

These realities and the data presented by researchers like BitWise in its March 2019 ETP application have led market data aggregators to adjust their volume representations. The chart below compares adjusted daily bitcoin volume figures for the month of November offered by two such aggregators, Messari and Nomics, against the unadjusted reported daily volume figures offered by CoinMarketCap, historically the best-known market data provider.

CoinDeskResearch_BitcoinVolume

The discrepancy between the two examples of adjusted bitcoin volume shown stems from the list of exchanges each data aggregator includes. Messari limits its “real” bitcoin volume number to the 10 exchanges identified in BitWise’s ETP application. Nomics rates 32 exchanges high enough on its “transparency rating” metric to include them in its “transparent volume” aggregate.

In its October response to an application for ETP approval by BitWise, a San Francisco-based fund manager, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted exchanges that BitWise excluded as fake are likely supporting some volume of real trading activity, a “gray area” that BitWise conceded in a reply to comments on the application.

The SEC’s response specifically mentioned HitBTC, Huobi, OKEx and a handful of exchanges based in South Korea, which were excluded due to capital controls there. Nomics’ adjusted bitcoin volume number includes HitBTC, but not Huobi, OKEx or any of the larger South Korean venues.

Anecdotally, traders say excluding liquid markets wholesale doesn’t make sense – especially Huobi and OKEx. “I’ve traded on OK since 2013, and it’s executable,” said Dan Matuszewski, former head of trading at Circle, a Boston-based developer of financial products in crypto. “That liquidity is there. Those markets are actionable. Do I think the number is 100 percent true? Absolutely not.”

CoinDeskResearch_BitcoinBidAskSpread

The chart above shows that, at least on Huobi, some bitcoin-base pairs are nearly as liquid as they are on Coinbase, according to order book data provided by Kaiko. Real daily bitcoin volume in November was probably somewhere between the $1.97 billion “transparent” volume that Nomics reported and CoinMarketCap’s unadjusted average daily volume figure of $22.56 billion – and even though Nomics’ number excludes some major exchanges, it probably gets closer to the truth than the unfiltered data on CoinMarketCap.

To some extent, it doesn’t matter. Aggregate bitcoin volume is a general data point, unlikely to inform a specific investment decision. In crypto’s fragmented markets, volume at specific venues, selected for their relevance to geographies or categories of investor, may be better signals. For example:

Coinbase's cash market volumes as an indicator of new retail participation

Activity on localbitcoins or regionally dominant exchanges

CME and Bakkt bitcoin futures activity as an indicator of US fiduciary institutions' participation","Bitcoin’s hash rate reached record highs this week amid rising prices and anticipation of the miner reward halving later this year.

Based on a rolling seven-day average, the hash rate has risen sharply from approximately 93 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Dec. 30 to more than 106 EH/s on Jan. 5. The best day overall was Jan. 1 when the hashing power exceeded 119 EH/s, surpassing the previous record of 114 EH/s set back in October.

Bitcoin hash rate (seven-day average) Source: Blockchain.com

Bitcoin’s hash rate has increased considerably over 2019, rising from a weekly average of 40 EH/s at the beginning of the year to 80 EH/s by September.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

That shift corresponded with the rise in bitcoin’s price from roughly $4,000 to more than $10,000 over the same timeframe. The hash rate first crossed the 100 EH/s milestone on Sept. 26, but it wasn’t until late October that it stayed above 100 EH/s for more than a day.

A plus-100 EH/s rate has become an increasingly frequent sight, with only one day so far this year reporting under the new benchmark.

Hash rate is a measure of the processing power dedicated to a blockchain. A high hash rate means more miners are working on the bitcoin network, suggesting it is increasingly economically viable at both the current bitcoin price and difficulty level. A report published in September predicted bitcoin’s two-week average hash rate would cross 100 EH/s at the end of 2019.

Bitcoin’s difficulty level automatically adjusts to ensure block time stays broadly at around the 10-minute mark, regardless of how many miners are working on the network. It adjusts every two weeks, the last being on Jan. 1 when it increased by 6.75 percent, the largest since September.

Plummeting cryptocurrency prices in 2018 forced many miners to shut up shop, with only the largest able to remain profitable. The industry faced an existential crisis as recently as last April when a government agency in China – home to more than two-thirds of all bitcoin mining operations – called mining “undesirable.”

However, the situation looked brighter for miners last year as the bear market faded. More than half a million new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) rigs are estimated to have come online in Q3 2019, following a summer in which the bitcoin price more than doubled.

In recent days, bitcoin prices have taken an upturn, rising nearly 10 percent from lows near $6,850 seen on Friday. The rise may have set the cryptocurrency up for a bullish trend shift, charts suggest, further encouraging miners.

2020 is set to be a crucial year for many miners looking to increase their capacity. Bitcoin’s block reward is expected to halve to 6.25 BTC in the coming months. While Bitmain is expected to make job cuts in anticipation of a drop in revenue, according to Chinese media, other companies are significantly scaling their operations.","How You Could Double Your Money at Least 6 TIMES This Year

For the past week, traders have been closely watching to see if Bitcoin could flip $7,450 from a resistance to support and many suggested that sustained move above $7,600 would open the door for a shot at the $8,000 to $8,200 range.

The 4-hour close above $7,600 pulled the price above the 50-day moving average (MA) and provided bulls with enough confidence to push the Bitcoin to set a daily higher high not seen since Nov. 21 when the asset traded for $8,122.

Currently, Bitcoin price is closing in on the 200-day moving average (MA) and this point is also within $40 of the main trendline of the long-term descending channel which formed when Bitcoin topped out at $13,800 on Jun. 26.

Traders will be keeping a close eye on this zone as the price has experienced multiple rejections at the trendline. The volume profile visible range (VPVR) also shows a high volume node right at the descending trendline ($8,168), meaning traders could anticipate so push back at this level and book profits.

The two companies agreed to conduct their operation at the 100-acre mining farm set up by Northern Bitcoin AG subsidiary Whinstone, sources told Bloomberg in a new report.

Northern Bitcoin AG, a Germany-based bitcoin mining company, revealed in Nov. 2019 that the Rockdale facility will initially see more than 300 megawatts in power capability, with the intention to reach one gigawatt by the end of 2020.

Back in the 1950s, Rockdale was dubbed “the town where it rains money” by The Saturday Evening Post for its lignite coal reserve and significant aluminum production. In recent years, however, the aluminum industry has been in decline and one of the town’s biggest smelting plants, Alcoa, closed down in 2008.

Yet Rockdale’s abundant coal supply and notable growth in wind energy have made it an attractive spot for Bitcoin miners seeking cheap electricity, according to Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.

In summer 2018, Bitmain took over the 33,000-acre property formerly owned by Alcoa and started the process of turning it into a mining farm, promising between 400 to 600 jobs. The 50-megawatt farm, branded by Bitmain as the “the world’s largest for bitcoin mining,” was launched in Oct. 2019. According to a new press release, 15,000 miners have been installed in the facility since then.

SBI and GMO’s new initiative builds on the local momentum. While Bitmain’s farm extends over a much larger parcel of land, the expected capacity of Northern Bitcoin AG’s farm could far exceed that of Bitmain’s, according to Bloomberg.

The two farms are not the only mining-related initiatives in the U.S. state. The Digital Currency Group (DCG)-backed investment fund, Layer1, secured $50 million in Oct. 2019 to build mining chips and run its own electricity substations in Texas.

Research shows that currently approximately 70% of crypto mining operations are located in China due to the country’s low electricity prices and miners’ close proximity to Chinese equipment producers like Bitmain and Creative Canaan. But the newfound interest in Rockdale could potentially turn the town into a new powerhouse for the industry, boosting mining businesses in the U.S. more broadly.","Bitbox, the cryptocurrency exchange by Japanese messaging giant LINE, is delisting XRP.

Announcing the news on Monday, Singapore-based Bitbox said it is also delisting XRP pairs tied against bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT). The delisting takes place on Jan. 16.

Accordingly, users will no longer be able to trade and deposit XRP, and they have until Feb. 16 to withdraw their funds.

While Bitbox did not give specific reasons for the move, the exchange said it delists coins when they do not meet its standards based on “performance, reliability, liquidity, or law and regulatory requirements.”

BitBox was launched in July 2018 and is one of the two cryptocurrency exchanges LINE operates to serve its 186 million users. Japan-based Bitmax is the other exchange that recently received a license from the country’s financial regulator. Notably, Bitmax was approved to offer trading services in XRP.

Selling things for bitcoin online doesn’t have to be hard. In fact, it shouldn’t be, given the decentralized nature and low fees of peer-to-peer electronic cash. For beginners and DIYers new to the world of creating an online bitcoin or crypto marketplace, this article seeks to provide some basic pointers and new resources to get you making deals and selling your wares or content for bitcoin in no time.

Getting Started

The first thing to do before setting up a website to sell content or goods for bitcoin is to have a product. Maybe it’s exclusive content, an old baseball card collection, or commissioned artworks. New paywall services, easy payment gateways, and highly accessible online marketplaces make offering these easy and quick, without long and tedious sign-up processes or the need to share too much personal information.

The second thing to consider is the type of crypto to accept. For the purposes of this article we’ll be looking at mostly bitcoin cash avenues, owing to the BCH network’s low fees, fast speeds, and innovative development culture. For the reader unfamiliar with the difference between Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC), more information can be found here. Readers who don’t yet have any BCH to experiment with, or a wallet to store it can get these for free as well, using this resource.

Pick an Avenue and Set up Shop

How a website sells for crypto depends largely on what a website sells for crypto. A blogger or content creator might want to put up a crypto paywall for access to exclusive content. A computer parts store could use a payment gateway to make processing crypto payments easy and compatible with existing channels and traditional currencies. Someone looking to sell various odds and ends might link to a crypto marketplace account or sell directly using a business wallet and an address pasted to their site. Whatever the approach, the following are some sites, services, and ideas that can help get you started.

Satoshiwall.cash

For those looking to set up a crypto paywall on their site, Satoshiwall is a quick and non-custodial solution. Even without an account at Satoshiwall.cash, anyone can paste in their BCH wallet address, upload content, choose a price denominated in one of multiple traditional currencies, and then share the link with fans and followers. Those wishing to view the content then pay the appropriate amount in BCH, Satoshiwall takes a non-custodial (thanks to BIP70) fee of 10%, and the post is revealed.

Each registered user also has their own RSS feed which enables interesting options like automatic sharing of paywalled content to your website or social media. A recent development summary posted to read.cash gives the full breakdown.

Openbazaar

The free online marketplace at Openbazaar allows users to create their own store page and “Sell whatever you’d like. Reach a new audience. Get paid in cryptocurrency.” The site takes no fees and is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network built on open source code. Online merchants can choose to be paid in cryptos like bitcoin cash, bitcoin core, litecoin and zcash, and prices can be denominated in multiple fiat currencies.

BCH-Friendly Payment Gateways

As Bitcoin.com elaborates regarding payment gateways: “A Bitcoin Cash payment gateway lets your customers pay with cryptocurrency on your website. The gateway is integrated into your site and you can use it to accept e-commerce sales, charity donations, invoice payments, and more.” Some payment gateways like Bitpay allow those still inexperienced with crypto to accept payments that are automatically converted to traditional currency on the merchant side. There are also non-custodial and privacy-focused options like Atomicpay and Blockonomics, where users keep complete control of their private keys.

A good payment gateway will provide you plenty of customizable options and embeddable buttons to make selling stuff for crypto on your website a smooth and fun process.

KISS

The KISS principle, standing for “keep it simple, stupid,” or “keep it stupid simple,” is always important to remember. It’s a big part of the reason this whole crypto thing came about in the first place. In the face of unnecessarily complex and privacy-invasive legacy financial protocols, a new money was born. There is something very clean, refreshing, and direct about a peer-to-peer electronic cash transaction with no meddling company or middleman standing in the way.

For the DIY enthusiast perhaps not interested in any of the above solutions, all that is truly needed to sell stuff for bitcoin on a website is a BCH address and a wallet. And that is the beauty of crypto. Just copy/paste an address and request the funds. Additionally, a brand new marketplace has just emerged for BCH payments for goods on the local.bitcoin.com peer-to-peer trading platform, so if you wish to direct your web traffic to your listings there, that’s also an option.

Whatever your choice, economic freedom is what bitcoin is all about, and the door is now opened for anyone — no longer just big corporations or exclusive groups — to trade value for value freely and easily online.

When Bitcoin first broke into the mainstream zeitgeist two years ago, celebs were quick to jump on the bandwagon and pander to cryptocurrency fans — like Katy Perry with her cringeworthy CrYpTo ClAwS.

Don’t get me wrong, we still had our fair share of stupid celeb moments in 2019. Superstar basketballer Kobe Bryant was somehow tricked into speaking at a TRON conference, while recording artist Akon appeared at one in Malta.

Oh, and Warren Buffet narrowly escaped lunch with shameless shillster Justin Sun.

Paid promotional shenanigans aside, this year actually saw mainstream culture adopt cryptocurrency in some (almost) tasteful ways. Let me count them for you.

Mr Robot codes a Bitcoin ‘mixer’

This wasn’t the first time that USA Network’s Mr Robot has featured Bitcoin, but it’s pretty dope. In the latest season, vigilante hacker Elliot Alderson is creating his own cryptocurrency “mixer.”

Cryptocurrency mixers are programs that jumble similar amounts together to make tracking their history more difficult. In real life, users looking to increase their crypto-privacy have readily adopted CoinJoin, a Bitcoin mixer, so it being featured in Mr Robot feels quite timely.

What’s cooler is that, for a brief moment, a Bitcoin address was actually shown on screen. One appeared as a suggestion in Elliot’s programming environment, and it didn’t take long for fans to start sending “Elliot” cryptocurrency.

The ‘Bitcoin mixer’ episode aired on November 24. At the time of writing (December 19), 31 transactions have flowed through the address flashed on-screen. Whoever controls it has withdrawn most of the Bitcoin.

Kurt Russell stars in CRYPTO, the movie

Early this year, we were graced with CRYPTO, a Hollywood masterpiece starring Kurt Russell, Luke Hemsworth, and Alexis Bledel — and don’t believe the haters, ‘cos it was fucking dope.

Hear me out. For one, the main character (Beau Knapp) is the natural-born enemy of any cryptocurrency fiend: an anti-money laundering bank officer, whose employer ships him off somewhere rural for asking too many damn questions.

Kurt Russell is his father. He has a really cool hat, and runs a failing potato farm that’s soon to be repossessed by the bank Knapp works for (!). His friend is also mining Bitcoin out of a liquor store fridge.

The real hook of the movie (aside from Russell’s hat) is a multi-million dollar RUSSIAN CRYPTOCURRENCY LAUNDERING PLOT that results in death threats to pretty much everyone involved.

I don’t really give a shit if that doesn’t pique your interest, just go and watch it.

CRYPTO’s crypto-realism gets 5 out of 10 Satoshis.

Billions actually hired a producer that knows Bitcoin

Rather than cryptocurrencies, the latest season of Billions explores the technology that underpins them, blockchain, and whether it could power a mobile-based voting system suitable for American democracy.

What plays out is a pretty decent dramatization of the risks associated with using blockchain to handle votes. On one hand, voting via smartphones would make politics more accessible, but it would also introduce a raft of security concerns to the process.

This is refreshing, especially when you consider that earlier episodes of Billions wedged cryptocurrency in by having characters toss each other Trezors loaded with digital cash.

All this is by design, too. In July, it was revealed that Ben Mezrich, the author of the Winklevii-centric book “Bitcoin Billionaires,” was joining the show as a consulting producer to keep it accurate.

Nobody buys drugs online (fast) with IOTA or Ripple

Watching this Netflix series felt a little too real at times. That’s because it was based on the story of Shiny Flakes, an enormously successful dark web drug marketplace that was run by an 18-year-old German kid out of his bedroom.

Shiny Flakes existed between 2013 and 2015, and by the time international cops caught up with its founder Maximilian S., he’d been sitting on 320 kilograms worth of drugs in his bedroom (worth $4.5 million), alongside 48,000 euros ($53,200) in cash, and $360,000 worth of Bitcoin.

He’d reportedly generated around a million dollars worth of revenue in the six months leading up to his arrest.

While the main character in Netflix‘s version is inspired to start selling drugs online to win back his girlfriend (who recently discovered ecstasy) someone from Maximilian S.’s family told Motherboard that he just wanted to “play God.”

The show is definitely fun, but it unfortunately features a glaring inconsistency that should unsettle anyone in the know. The fictional version of Shiny Flakes indeed accepts Bitcoin, but dark web drug buyers can also use alternatives like IOTA, Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum — which just doesn’t happen in reality.

What’s been happening in 2019 to bitcoin price?

Following the high point of winter 2017, the bitcoin bubble began to burst, with its price falling over 50% in just four months. In April 2018, the price of one bitcoin plummeted to US$7,000, before it finally bottomed out at US$3,500 at the end of that year.

Last year, however, was much kinder to the cryptocurrency network. It opened 2019 at a paltry US$3,717, before rising to a 52-week high of US$12,701 on 28 June.

This exponential growth appeared to have come on the back of increasing mining difficulty – the rate of ease of generating one bitcoin. Around the same time that bitcoin price hit its then-52-week peak level of US$9,000 in mid-2019, its mining difficulty rose by 11.26% to 7.46 trillion, an all-time high.

Hash rates – which measures the processing power and how secure the network is – also hit a then-historic high of 74 quintillion hashes per second in August 2019. A higher hash rate means the bitcoin network is less prone to hacking, making it more valuable.

The second half of 2019 was not quite as great, as price started to drop off, eventually losing around 43.5% from the summer’s peak to close the year at US$7,120 per bitcoin.

What’s the forecast for bitcoin price in 2020?

The year is off to a decent start so far for the digital gold. As of 07 January, its price has risen over 14% (and nearly US$1,000) since the year’s first day of trading (02 January) to the present level of US$7,885.

One observer – Antoni Trenchev, the founder of cryptocurrency lending facility Nexo, says that the bitcoin price could rise 9,000,000% to hit US$50,000 by the end of 2020.

‘Our analysts have done very substantial research, and there is a hell of a ride coming up because the rewards for miners are dropping. The last time this happened, bitcoin rallied 4,000%,’ Trenchev told Bloomberg TV.

Trenchev is referring to an upcoming bitcoin halving event that could take place later this year. According to bitcoinclock.com, a website which counts down to the next event, the halving could take place as early as 11 May 2020.

Bitcoin halving is when the number of new bitcoins being issued are cut by 50%. New bitcoins are issued by the bitcoin network every ten minutes. It is said that this number is reduced by half every four years.

The number of new bitcoins issued every ten minutes for the first four years (2008 to 2012) of bitcoin’s existence was 50. In 2012, the number of new bitcoins issued every ten minutes dropped from 50 bitcoins to 25. In 2016, it dropped from 25 to 12.5. In this year’s halving, it will drop from 12.5 to 6.25.

With a lower supply of bitcoins and demand still steady, the price is expected to rally dramatically. After the first halving in 2012, bitcoin price skyrocketed 930% in the preceding months. The halving of 2016 helped to lay the foundations for the impending price rallies of 2017.

Even if the price does not come anywhere close to that, a target of US$10,000 – or at least 25% above the current price – looks highly possible, said UK asset analyst Bill Charison.

He noted that the charts of both gold and bitcoin are ‘eerily similar’, and if bitcoin follows the trajectory of gold closely, the currency could trade in the five figures as early as February, leaving a post-halving price inflation firmly in sight.

With mining difficulty and hash rate currently at a record high of 13.8 trillion and 98.67 EH/s respectively, the bull case for bitcoin is looking strong again.

As central bankers around the world get set for a prolonged period of monetary debasement, the 99% could look to Bitcoin for protection.

A Decade of Monetary Debasement Looms

The European Central Bank issued guidance at the end of last year that it would keep “the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to — but below — 2%.” The ECB cited weak, although stabilized, GDP growth in the Euro area of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter to justify its inflationary monetary stance.

President Trump has famously called for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to weaken the dollar, with a tweet in July arguing that:

“China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games — as they have for many years!”

Fed’s Efforts to Stoke a Flailing Economy

In the wake of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, the Fed made five percentage points worth of interest rate cuts, to rates approaching zero. It embarked on a quantitative easing package to stimulate the economy, buying bonds among other means. Yet the recovery from recession was weak and drawn out.

Despite a stronger economy and near full employment levels, the Fed remains concerned about growth. Interest rates remain low, sitting now at 1.5 to 1.75%. In the event of an economic crisis, it has little wriggle room to stimulate activity.

From Roubini to the Gini

Nouriel Roubini infamously railed against cryptocurrency, with one of his more notorious accusations coming at the end of 2018. The economist argued that Bitcoin was less equitable than North Korea:

Decentralization in crypto is a myth. It is a system more centralized than North Korea: miners are centralized, exchanges are centralized, developers are centralized dictators (Buterin is ""dictator for life"" ) & the Gini inequality coefficient of bitcoin is worse than North Korea — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) October 8, 2018

The Gini coefficient is used to measure income, and sometimes wealth, inequality. Gini indexes range from a theoretical zero (0%) to one (100%), with more equitable countries achieving lower scores. According to the OECD, the United States had a Gini coefficient of 0.39 in 2017. It was 0.28 in Sweden and, in less equitable China, in 2011 it was over 0.5.

Bitcoin’s Gini coefficient reveals a highly inequitable distribution, ranging between 0.88 to 0.98 over most of its lifetime.

Applying these metrics to Bitcoin, however, is hardly fair. It is a nascent asset and is characterized by poor levels of penetration among the general public. A small number wallets hold billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s lack of equitable spread is a product of the fact that there was a small number of early adopters.

Monetary Debasement the Real Threat to the Middle Class

With central banks determined to pursue accomodative monetary policy stances, the resultant debasement of fiat currency value and the inflation it is designed to cause is more harmful to those who can least afford it.

In a recent tweet from Tuur Demeester, two charts indicate a correlation between the Fed’s expansionary policies and inequality:

Monetary debasement significantly contributes to the wealth transfer from poor to rich. The rich have access to the money before it loses its purchasing power (via borrowing), and thus harvest wealth from the poor. As the money cheapened in the 90s, the wealth gap grew in tandem: pic.twitter.com/T9HxIHLP2k — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) January 3, 2020

The first chart shows Federal Reserve interest rates over time:

The second shows rising inequality in the US over time:

There has been a clear correlation between monetary easing and rising inequality since the early nineties. If the trend continues, the second chart suggests the richest Americans will own a rising share of resources. The richest 0.1% already own as many assets as the bottom 90%.

Demeester argues that “Monetary debasement significantly contributes to the wealth transfer from poor to rich.” The reason is access. The rich have access to money to purchase assets. As money is debased over time, asset prices rise in nominal terms.

The less well-off are faced with rising asset prices and lagging income growth. Without the means to hold appreciating assets that protect the poor from rising prices, the gap between the rich and poor expands.

As central bankers look set to engage in a long-running currency war, a prolonged period of monetary debasement appears to be on the horizon. The poor will be the ultimate victims, with the wealth transfer from the have nots to the haves set to continue.

Bitcoin may become the hedge against risk many of its proponents have promoted it as. The digital gold narrative is not especially new. Grayscale’s high-profile #dropgold campaign called for the public to abandon gold and flock to Bitcoin.

No crypto asset has truly been tested as a safe-haven asset in either a recession or a period of monetary easing. It has, however, become a default investment in economies experiencing political turmoil or hyperinflation. It remains to be seen if a gentler and longer-term period of fiat debasement in the west will attract the interest of those for whom central bank accommodation is economically harmful.","As a Managing Partner at Digital Asset Risk Management Advisors (DARMA Capital), and former Head of Global Business Development at blockchain software powerhouse ConsenSys, I’ve had an inside look at the rapid development of blockchain technology, the extreme volatility of crypto markets, and the emerging ecosystem and culture of decentralization. And let me tell you: Blockchain is entering a pivotal year in 2020, a period that will decide not just the future of cryptocurrency, but blockchain and the very idea of decentralization.

Buckle up, because it’s going to be quite the ride. Here are 20 predictions for blockchain in 2020.

1. Ethereum right now is like dial-up internet in 1996—14.4kbps. Soon it will be the equivalent of broadband.

Remember the days of dial-up internet? Let me take you back to 1996: although AOL was quickly becoming a household name, getting online for most required swapping tangled wired connections and clogging up phone lines to access a limited range of products at a snail’s pace. With a 14.4kpbs connection, intrepid retail consumers could browse the world wide web while transferring data at 1.8kbs per second. To download a megabyte of data took over 9 minutes. All of the content was text-based and bare bones, but it worked! Casual observers could see that this technology would be useful, but few predicted the wholesale societal and economic transformation the internet would bring to the world within a matter of years.

Sound familiar? It’s directly analogous to where we’re currently at with blockchain. 2020 in blockchain years is the equivalent of 1996 in the internet era. Much like the internet, blockchain progress will kick into overdrive with Moore’s Law, and Ethereum 2.0 will be the big red button that launches us off of dial up and into broadband. (Disclosure: I’ve owned Ethereum for several years.) The signs are all there. Almost every sector and leading enterprise is looking into blockchain implementation, governments are terrified of being left behind and are scrambling to catch up, while the infrastructural elements are now in place for developers to build, deploy, and scale products. In 2020 we will begin to see what a decentralized future actually looks like.

2. Bitcoin and blockchain will finally break up

Bitcoin should be revered as the patriarch of digital assets. Bitcoin confluenced cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, a virtual machine, and a consensus formation algorithm to solve “the double spend” and “the Byzantine general’s problem” elegantly. That said, time moves on. The Bitcoin maximalists that believe Bitcoin is where this decentralizing technology might be are in for a rude awakening.

As blockchain reaches a scaling watershed, there’s one key differentiation that the world will come to acknowledge, one that enthusiasts are likely already very familiar with—the difference between Bitcoin, Ethereum and other decentralizing technologies. Bitcoin’s ascension to digital gold has been astounding, and has signaled the beginning of a whole new techno-economic era. But digital gold is just that—a beginning.

The current market capitalization of gold is $8 trillion dollars. That’s an eye-popping number, sure, but it represents a potential ceiling market opportunity for Bitcoin’s “digital gold.” Smart contract-enabled blockchains like Ethereum will digitize the global economy and unlock value in the whole spectrum of assets and processes. In turn, decentralized networks will reach into the farthest corners of every industry on the planet (and beyond). We will be able to digitally represent fiat, gold, software licenses, equity, debt, derivatives, loyalty points, reputation ratings, and much much more that we can’t even conceive of yet. That’s a market opportunity estimated at well over $80 trillion dollars. Bitcoin is a singular use case. Comparatively, Ethereum has infinite use cases.

3. The potential for global economic recession looms, fiat currencies be warned!

Economic uncertainty has been looming over the globe for years. It’s not so much a matter of if, but when the house of cards tumbles with major worldwide implications. Europe will likely be the first to hit recession. One look at the five biggest economies in the region and it’s clear. Germany’s Deutschebank is on life support. The United Kingdom has been eating itself with Brexit for years. France is in a state of constant protest. The Spanish and Italian economies are drowning. The European Union is by now only nominally a union, and growing divisions will leave many nations especially vulnerable.

With respect to the USA, let me paint two realities for you: In 2020, China and the U.S. finally reach a real trade deal. The economy gets a tailwind into 2021 and Donald Trump is re-elected. There’s another leg to this stock market blow-off phase. The house of cards lives another day. If there is no trade deal or no re-election and the global economy is further challenged, the bottom could fall out of Quantitative Easing Mania, and the value of many national currencies around the world will be challenged like never before. The value of fiat currencies could endure a precipitous drop in value via extreme inflation.

Digital assets have exiguous properties similar to gold and oil in that they are provenly scarce. If and when this crisis lands, the digital asset class will be the hedge to traditional central banking systems that resort to printing—and thus depreciating—currencies in times of crisis.

4. The U.S. will have to play catch-up after China’s big play in crypto and blockchain

In January 2020, a new suite of regulation will come into effect that represents a sharp about turn by the Chinese government towards a pro-blockchain and cryptocurrency stance. With new legislation towards mining, state news channels praising Bitcoin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced governmental support for blockchain technology in October, it’s clear that China is making its move. China’s central bank will soon test its own digital currency in the cities of Shenzhen and Suzhou with four state-owned commercial banks. Countries like the United States that may have been sluggish to take a leading role in supporting blockchain development will be left with little choice but to play catch-up, and the result will be a huge net positive for the industry.

5. We march onwards to Ethereum 2.0

The long-awaited Istanbul hard fork—the final hard fork of Ethereum 1.0—has successfully deployed. The Muir Glacier difficulty bomb delay update was the cherry on top. Vitalik Buterin has already released a block explorer for the Proof of Stake Beacon Chain, and the march towards Ethereum 2.0 is proceeding at a rapid clip. Proof of Stake Ethereum exists. It’s alive! The roadmap to Serenity is in full effect. 2020 will see Ethereum move stridently beyond Phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0, onto Phase 1 and the launch of shard chains. Then, it’s game on.

Ethereum developers have already proven their ability to work wonders, and that this decentralized team is now in the stride of hitting ambitious roadmap targets is the best indicator in all of blockchain for future success. To daily observers, this upgrading process may seem long and winding, but the extra time it takes to develop the network properly will benefit the entirety of humanity. While Web2 was defined by philosophies like ‘Move Fast, Break Things,’ Web3 should be guided by mantras like ‘Do it the Right Way This Time.’

6. Layer two scaling solutions will turbocharge Ethereum

Ogres, like onions—and like blockchain networks—are all about layers. With the rollout of the Istanbul hard fork, Ethereum is on its way towards 2.0 levels of scalability at layer one. Joe Lubin stated last year at SXSW that Ethereum will process millions of transactions a second. How it achieves this is a combination of steady upgrades to the layer one network and integration of layer two scaling implementations.

Poon and Buterik’s solution of Plasma’s “blockchains on blockchains” was not just brilliant and prescient, it was the inception of a whole sector of Layer Two development. Sharded chains may occupy much of the debate at the moment, but state channels being developed by Celer, Connext, and Counterfactual will be the massive mycelial data network underground that unleashes the main chain to operate unencumbered by state weight. Sidechains will transact the bulk of lower-risk transactions rapidly. Payment channels like Raiden will enable instantaneous token transfers, while ZK-Snarks will keep all of your data private amidst all the transactional action. The stack is all there, and 2020 will see 2.0 come to life.

In the meantime, innovations like Plasma’s Optimistic Virtual Rollup means that projects don’t have to wait for the transactional throughput they need to flourish. That’s huge. There was a time when blockchain scaling was driven by theory and hope. No longer! The incredible, global, decentralized dev teams working on Ethereum will change the world with this technology, and we are all eternally grateful.

7. Layers of the Web3.0 stack go live

A decentralized environment is about more than just shards and nodes, and we’ll see that manifest in in 2020. Web3.0 will be defined by mesh networks connecting smart contracts, file storage, messaging, payment channels, side chains, oracles—the list goes on. 2020 will see many essential infrastructural elements of Web3.0 go live.

What is Web3.0? Here’s a quick breakdown:

The digitization of all assets: Stocks, bonds, fiat currencies, electrons, loyalty points, software licenses, Beyonce concert tickets, insurance policies, derivatives and other assets previously inconceivable, will become natively digital.

The automation of agreements: Microsoft Word legal documents will turn into digitalIf > Then > Else lines of computer code that will move the aforementioned digital assets trustlessly, creating completely new business models like an employment agreement that gets paid by the minute, a piece of art that can pay a royalty to an artist every time it is sold from one owner to the next, a piece of real estate that can pay its investors automatically every time rent comes in, the ability to divide income amongst band members every time a song is played, or routing an electron efficiently to various parts of a micro-grid.

Self-Sovereign Identity: Instead of logging into Airbnb, Facebook, Uber, et al, you will log into your own self-sovereign browser, and will have the same ability to rent a hotel room, use social media or hail a car, but instead of the legacy application providers the same service will occur peer-to-peer, rather than through a thin layer of rent-seeking intermediation. You’ll get paid $1 dollar a day to look at advertising when on social media instead of Zuckerberg and your ride and home shares will be 2/3rd of the current cost.

Some examples: The Interplanetary File System has already showed the nature of data file storage on the decentralized web. Protocol Labs’ Filecoin builds on IPFS to rent users’ hard drive space for crypto. The platform is on schedule to launch in March, with the testnet just launched very recently.

Helium is a mesh network where stakeholders purchase nodes under $500 to provide low bandwidth for Internet of Things devices. Tom Shaughnessy of Delphi Digital recently noted, “Since going live on August 1, 2019, over 2,130 nodes are live on the network covering 90% of U.S. states across 425+ cities. At Verizon’s IoT costs (600KB/year for $12), Helium is underpricing Verizon by 99.9988% ($0.00001 for 24 bytes or 0.024 KB). This type of price consolidation we should expect from the next generation of cell phone service providers, data storers, and truly any intermediary via a decentralized world wide web.

Kyle Samani, and the team at Multicoin Capital have done a great job of mapping a potential Web3.0 software stack with examples of companies attempting to provide solutions. Although it remains the very early days and we’ll see tremendous competition for a hegemonic position for all layers of the Web3.0 stack, the Web3.0 stack will likely look a little something like this:

8. Expect a radically altered blockchain landscape by 2021

By the turn of 2021, we will have a much clearer picture of whether newfangled layer one blockchain networks like Near, Polkadot, Dfinity, and Nervos will be able to contribute substantially to the blockchain ecosystem. Competition is good and I remind everyone that the goal is global disintermediation, decentralization, and the commoditization of trust, rather than a brand of protocol winning. That said, this sprint to layer one supremacy has only spurred on the development of Ethereum 2.0, and the many competing elements are experimenting with new ways to develop the best blockchain product. The answer to who will succeed lies with developers and users.

Ethereum still retains the most robust developer engagement by far. Some view this race as a winner-takes-all, but with so much to be gained from developing this new technology, coopetition will raise the tide for all. There could also be fit-for-purpose blockchains, that satisfy particular niches. New competitors to the layer 1 space will have to deal with Matteo Leibovitz’s “distribution quadrilemma,” which states criteria that new networks must simultaneously satisfy at launch to engender monetary premium. They are:

wide/equitable distribution revenue generation potential for upside regulatorily compliant

The biggest challenge is requirement #4. If a VC or multiple whales own a large amount of a network’s tokens—a ubiquitous occurrence with layer one “Ethereum Killers” — it will be incredibly difficult to sway the SEC that the token isn’t a security, which means all those big investments and will disrupt nothing but VC piggy banks.

9. The tribulations of Libra will continue…

Facebook’s Libra will not go live in 2020 in any form of scale. The “decentralized wolf in sheep’s clothing” has already done much to bring blockchain to the forefront of global discourse—for better, and at times, for worse. But the company is learning fast that consensus and deployment do not always adhere to the best laid plans of even billionaires. When it does go live, Libra will undoubtedly be a force of education and adoption for billions of people. Farmville with crypto? I can’t wait! Before it gets to that point, however, expect Chinese organizations like WeChat, Alipay, and Alibaba to aggressively pursue first mover status in the space given the recently relaxed regime in the country. Trust in Facebook stagnates still as we enter another election year in the US. If social media has proven so earth-shakingly problematic, we can only guess what ills Facebook’s version of ‘social banking’ may hold within.

10. Trillion dollar companies signal the climax and end of the 3rd industrial revolution

Apple. Microsoft. PetroChina. Saudi Aramco. When the next behemoth rises over a trillion dollar valuation—it will stay there. That same company probably won’t pay a single dollar in U.S. taxes. This is a prime example of vast inequality in the value capture of our economic systems, and it’s only getting worse. Legacy Web2.0 companies are making billions for the shareholder capital class by using the individual as the product. They’re spilling personal data into the clutches of nefarious actors with alarming regularity. As more and more companies pass the trillion dollar mark, it will signal the blow-off phase of late capitalism. After the inevitable crash, we’ll be faced with a once-in-an-epoch opportunity for more equitable, democratized, and sustainable business models to proliferate. Will you be ready?

11. Self Sovereignty on the web will become a human right

With hacks and breaches in both Web2.0 and Web3.0 environments a daily occurrence, it’s clear that change is a necessity. Projects like the Decentralized Identity Foundation have taken major strides in establishing open source standards that will furnish the whole blockchain ecosystem with digital identity components that are trustworthy and decentralized. Blockchain IDs and zero-trust datastores like those created by uPort and 3box will rapidly replace the creaky walled databases we rely on now. Establishing this web of trust may be amongst the most important pieces of the blockchain puzzle in 2020.

Web2.0 stalwarts like IBM and Microsoft are well aware of the urgency of the issue, and they’ve allocated substantial resources to iterating digital identity in their own image. But self-sovereignty must be just that—owned by our selves—before the internet can be truly democratized. Ownership and privacy of data will soon be seen as a human right, and self sovereignty is the solution to attaining it.

12. Say it with me…CME Ether futures

After Bitcoin futures options in January, I have a feeling that it’ll be Ethereum’s turn. CME Ether Futures will be announced in 2020 and will go live in 2020. The CME has an almost 125 year history of innovation in financial instruments, birthing both new asset classes and digitizing the process of exchange along the way. With Bitcoin and Ethereum, the CME will continue this tradition of innovation, in turn catalyzing legitimacy for digital assets and opening access doors for mainstream investors and institutions to kickstart the next round of market growth for digital assets. Futures & options create forward demand curves that are a necessary precursor to a regulated ETF market. Our once child-like asset class is growing up.

13. A billion dollar DeFi ecosystem is a matter of months away

Decentralized Finance will continue to lead the industry in the first quarter of 2020. Over $600 million dollars are currently locked up in decentralized finance platforms. That number will cross one billion before summer. Organizations like a16z have bet big on platforms MKR and Compound, while projects like Synthetix, Uniswap, dYdX, and InstaDapp are furnishing a feverishly active sector of the blockchain ecosystem, one that isn’t immediately contingent upon scaling timelines. That said, DeFi organizations will probably have to spend some big legal dollars in compliance and lobbying. Just one example: in all 50 states, a company needs a specific license to lend to retail clients. When DeFi inevitably gets too big to ignore, regulators will roll out the red tape carpet.

14. The sleeping giant of blockchain awakens — supply chain

Counterfeit goods represent a market of over $1.8 billion dollars annually, with some estimates seeing that number rising over 10% as production and online distribution methods improve. Household names like Louis Vuitton and Levi’s have been quietly perfecting proof of concept trials with leading blockchain companies to ensure provenance and protect consumers on a global scale. Treum has already shown the value of blockchain-ensured supply chain processes on items ranging from salsa to tuna to skincare products. Now, major box retailers like Walmart and international food corporations Nestle and Dole are diving in head first. A recent report stated that companies in Western Europe alone are set to save $450 billion dollars in the next fifteen years with blockchain based supply chain solutions, with operating costs reduced almost 1% across the board. That’s a whole lotta tuna!

15. Art and music will take a lead in consumer-interfacing blockchain applications

Blockchain’s impact on art, music, and the creative space will be profound. In a 2014 report, The Fine Arts Expert Institute (FAEI) in Geneva stated that over 50% of artworks it had examined were either forged or not attributed to the correct artist. Blockchain can fix this now, and I’ve experienced it myself. This year, I purchased a work of art titled “The Human Way” by Vladimir Kush. The payment, certificate of authenticity, and ownership history were irrevocably recorded on the Ethereum blockchain with Treum. By this time next year, this process will be far more commonplace. And it’s not just provenance that makes the arts a prime field for blockchain implementation. Tokenized ownership and the establishment of equitable business models not beholden to gatekeepers have the attention of the art world already. Watch this space.

16. Proof of Work is dying while killing Earth. Long live Proof of Stake.

Retro gaming may be in vogue, but by the end of 2020, Proof of Work will be considered the Atari while we’re all getting used to the controls on the Proof of Stake Playstation. Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum were early adopters of the concept of Proof of Stake, and now there’s a whole industry of projects utilizing stake-based validators to uphold blockchain networks. The reason why is clear: Not only does it unlock the scalability trilemma in terms of speed and security, it is far less taxing on the Earth—y’know, the thing we’re trying to change with this whole decentralization movement anyway. Proof of Work is inherently wasteful, and what’s the point of revolutionizing economic systems if it means contributing to the destruction of the environment? It’s time to move forward.

17. Regulators gonna regulate

While the expectations of the blockchain and larger tech world may move fast, regulators and governments were built to move slowly. Digital assets have now moved out of a phase of distrust by legislative and regulatory institutions, and policy at both the agency and legislative level is aligning to unshackle the technology and streamline regulation. The most recent guidance from the IRS in October suggests that the US government acknowledges that virtual currencies will play a big part in the economy to come. Further, it is well known that the CFTC does not see Ether as a security. Wyoming’s leadership in this regard—with a total of 13 pro-blockchain laws—is behooving other states to catch up. And if there’s one thing that will provide an impetus for the federal government to move forward on the issue, it’s not being left behind by China. 2020 will see positive guidance on blockchain introduced at the state, national, and international level.

18. The unbanked remain unbanked — For now

Decentralized Finance is a remarkable phenomenon with major implications for both blockchain and global economies, but for the time being it will continue to fall short of the oft-repeated mantra and goal of ‘banking the unbanked’ via providing access to financial services to billions of people around the world who need it most. Why? As it stands, the lending community is insular, and issues around ‘reputation’ mean that those who need it most can’t access it. These will surely be ironed out over time, but for the duration of 2020, Decentralized Finance will continue to steadily grow in an enlarging, but closed circle. And that’s not a bad thing. Look at it this way: The sector is already approaching the billion dollar mark, and we’re still effectively in beta mode.

19. User Experience Will Have To Be Better Than Web2.0

Apple’s iPhone is the best selling phone ever because it’s simple and it works. That’s all the consumer needs to know. While many of us tech nerds get our jollies tinkering around the various layers of the Web3.0 stack, everything will need to be abstracted away for the typical Web3.0 user experience to appeal to the general populous. That’s why masterfully artistic UI/UX designers are as important to this industry right now as low layer distributed systems computer scientists.

But UX/UI isn’t just about clean lines and minimal design. From standards to libraries, toolkits, scaling solutions, onboarding, custody and wallet integration, there’s so much that has to be optimized beneath the screen to present that level of functional simplicity. Rimble is an example of an open-source library for creating improved user experiences for Web3.0 decentralized applications. Expect this to be a prime sector for development in 2020. While the first wave of decentralized consumer apps put blockchain front and center, the next will be led by projects that are more subtle and nuanced in the method of blockchain integration.

20. “If you’re going through hell… keep going” – Winston Churchill

The bubble and burst of cryptocurrency in 2017 was like an excessive frat house rager that led to a helluva hangover in 2018 and 2019. There are two types of bubbles, though. Some — like the housing crash of 2008 — leave behind debt encumbrances and waste, while others — like the dot.com bubble — establish foundational infrastructure and crystallize key organizations which go on to become a backbone of the industry. The crypto bubble is akin to the latter, and will lead to the real blockchain boom, one driven by utility, not speculation.

In the wake of crypto markets’ irrational exuberance in 2017 and equally irrational despondency in 2018, the core blockchain community of developers and technologists got to work, heads down, and focused on building infrastructure. Their labor is now bearing fruit. We’re at the crossroads of the next industrial revolution, and it begins in 2020. This progress towards global decentralization and automation will lead to the most prosperous society we’ve ever had.

Here’s to the roaring 20’s!

2020-01-08,"Increasing global uncertainties and a weak dollar will likely push more investors into bitcoin as it becomes recognized as a store of value. The cryptocurrency’s fixed supply will further drive price increases throughout the year, Bloomberg analysts predict.

Bloomberg’s 2020 crypto outlook report, published Monday, predicts bitcoin’s price could move to the top of its 2019 range and retest the $14,000 high at a time when a weak dollar and stock market volatility continue and geopolitical tensions increase.

“Bitcoin’s initial reaction to the [Jan. 3] U.S. airstrike that killed one of Iran’s most powerful generals was a good test of our premise that the first-born crypto is maturing toward a digital version of gold,” reads the report. Bitcoin jumped to a seven-week high Wednesday as gold rallied to $1,600 for the first time since 2013.

Bitcoin has long been seen as “digital gold,” in part because it is a limited asset that cannot be easily increased to meet changing demand, much like the yellow metal. The halving event expected later this year will reduce block rewards from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC, further adding to supply pressures should demand continue to grow.

Bitcoin’s supply is projected to grow by about 2.5 percent in 2020, which would be an all-time low. That’s partly due to the halving of the block reward – from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. Supply in 2021 could well fall below 2 percent, analysts say.

Increasing investment in bitcoin could take many forms, believe the analysts. The rapidly expanding derivatives market – a sign of integration into mainstream markets – will better enable institutional investors to gain exposure to the asset class. That could have knock-on effects on price and decreasing volatility, thereby reinforcing bitcoin’s status as a store of value.

Not everyone is convinced bitcoin and gold share such a strong bond. Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, which specializes in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, called such a relationship “weak” and noted the correlation between the two assets was negative until recently.

Bitcoin has also been prone to periods of short, sharp volatility. The asset surged up above $10,000 after President Xi of China called for his country to accelerate its adoption of blockchain technology before retracing its former range weeks later. For some analysts, that volatility fundamentally undermines the case for bitcoin being a stable store of value, at least for the time being.

But while bitcoin may still be too volatile for many people’s liking, it appears investors in the asset class are increasingly valuing digital assets that can maintain some sort of stable price. The Bloomberg report predicts that tether’s market cap will likely continue expanding this year, with many alternative cryptocurrencies struggling to keep investors as supply outstrips demand.","Messaging app Line has announced it is delisting XRP from its crypto exchange later this month, after the token failed to meet the minimum standards expected by the exchange.

BitBox, a Singaporean subsidiary of Line which operates its cryptocurrency exchange business, announced the decision on a notice published to its website, in which it flagged the reasons for delisting tokens from its exchange.

Most notably, the exchange said it keeps a constant review of its listed tokens, and delists those that no longer “meet our standards,” based on a number of different criteria.

“We keep a constant watch on all coins that are being traded on BITBOX. If a coin does not meet our standards based on its performance, reliability, liquidity, or law and regulatory requirements, it will be delisted from our exchange. To protect your assets and interests, we provide sufficient notice before delisting.”

XRP is set to be delisted at midnight on the January 16, which will see all of its crypto pairs removed, including ETH, USDT and BTC:

“Starting at 23:59:59 (UTC) on January 16, 2020, delisted coin and pairs will no longer be available for deposits and trades, and all unfilled orders affected by the delisting will be canceled automatically. To ensure the safety of your assets, we recommend you cancel all orders manually before the mentioned coin is delisted.”

Users have been advised to close all affected trades in advance of the deadline. The exchange has permitting users until February 16 to remove the coin from their exchange.

The announcement is a major blow for XRP, which is currently the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. While LINE and BitBox has yet to comment on the specific reasons for the delisting, it has said it does not intend to dump its holdings on the market, which would further impact on XRP price.

XRP has historically accounted for only 0.02% of BitBox trading volume, with traders far preferring other crypto assets. Nevertheless, the decision will still affect those with holdings or positions in XRP, which must now be concluded by the January 15 delisting deadline.

Bitcoin hit seven-week highs during the Asian trading hours and could extend the rally to a key Fibonacci hurdle above $8,600.

A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $7,960 looks likely and would confirm a falling channel breakout on the weekly chart and signal a revival of the bull run from lows near $4,100 seen in April 2019.

Gold witnessed a channel breakout at the end of December and has rallied by more than $100 ever since.

Acceptance below $8,000 would weaken the odds of channel breakout this week.

Bitcoin jumped to seven-week highs early on Wednesday and appears on track to confirm a significant price breakout similar to that seen by gold.

According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the number one cryptocurrency by market value rose to $8,463 – the highest level since Nov. 18 – during the Asian trading hours as Iran launched retaliatory attacks on the American bases in Iraq.

While bitcoin rallied to multi-week highs, gold, a classic haven asset, jumped above $1,600 for the first time since 2013. Other anti-risk assets like Japanese yen, Swiss franc and U.S. bonds also drew bids.

The safe-haven narrative surrounding bitcoin has strengthened with the cryptocurrency gaining ground in tandem with gold since Friday.

The yellow metal found takers near $1,530 on Friday after the U.S. killed a top Iranian military commander and rose to a high of $1,611 earlier today. Meanwhile, bitcoin turned higher from lows near $6,850 on Friday and has gained more than 20 percent since.

The cryptocurrency now looks set to take a page out of gold’s book and confirm a falling channel breakout on the weekly chart.

Bitcoin and gold weekly charts

As can be seen, both assets had a tough time in the second half of 2019.

Gold (above right) topped out at $1,557 at the end of August and fell to lows below $1,450 in November, creating a falling channel on the weekly chart. The channel was breached on the higher side in the last week of December with a convincing move above $1,483. The breakout signaled a resumption of the rally from lows near $1,270 seen in April and since then, the yellow metal has rallied by more than 8 percent.

Bitcoin’s weekly chart (above left) also shows a falling channel, which represents the sell-off from the June 2019 high of $13,880 to the low of $6,425 reached in December.

The cryptocurrency is currently trading above the falling channel resistance of $7,960. A breakout would be confirmed if prices close the week (Sunday, UTC) above $7,960. That would imply a continuation of the rally from April 2019 low of $4,100 and open the doors for a re-test of $13,880.

A breakout looks likely with bullish developments on key technical indicators.

Weekly and daily chart

Bitcoin’s rise to seven-week highs has confirmed seller exhaustion signaled by multiple long-tailed weekly candles and the bullish divergence of the MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and identify trend changes.

A bullish divergence occurs when an indicator produces higher lows, contradicting lower lows on price and is considered an advance warning of an impending bullish reversal. The MACD has charted higher lows since early December.

Meanwhile, the daily chart is reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, also a bullish reversal pattern. The recent rally looks to have legs, as buying volumes (not shown) have risen over the last few days and the MACD is charting higher bars above the zero line, signaling a strengthening of bullish momentum.

All-in-all, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to $8,626 –

the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $10,350 to

$6,425.

The odds of bitcoin confirming a channel breakout this coming

Sunday would drop if prices find acceptance below $8,000 with high

volumes.

That said, stronger buying pressure could emerge in the subsequent weeks, yielding a breakout, as miner reward halving (supply-cutting event) is due in May.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,340, representing a 5.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.","MIAMI, Jan. 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via CryptoCurrencyWire -- The 2020 North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC), a stalwart of the crypto scene, is once again launching in Miami on January 15th - 17th.

Before pivoting to crypto, Yang and his co-founder Del Wang worked in the world of microfinance. Yang’s first venture, Standard Financial Inclusion, provided financial services for the underbanked.

Speaking via email, Yang shared his views on the past year in crypto, President Xi’s ambition to “seize” the blockchain opportunity and what China’s stablecoin (from its central bank, or PBoC) means for global finance. His responses have been lightly edited for clarity.

What have been the biggest events in the crypto industry in 2019? How will these events affect the industry going forward?

The two biggest events were connected: the Facebook-led Libra project and China’s pivot towards blockchain technology. These two events are connected in the sense of uncovering blockchain’s relationship to currency development.

Libra drew the general public’s attention to crypto and blockchain technologies. President Xi’s address on the importance of blockchain technology pushed the government to speed up development of its fiat digital currency program, primarily due to the pressure of Libra on the renminbi (RMB). Both will have a long-term positive impact for the industry.

Although Libra will face lots of obstacles and President Xi’s announcement has brought more regulatory attention to crypto in the short term, I believe these two events will help attract more resources and people to the industry and eventually boost the market in the long term.

What were the most significant advances for crypto or blockchain technology in China in 2019?

Unfortunately, in 2019 I didn’t observe any significant advances in blockchain technology. On the other hand, I observed the advance in the government’s attitude towards blockchain technology, although the most significant impact will be on the RMB rather than cryptocurrencies.

China’s ambition is to bolster the RMB rather than blockchain technology itself.

Why did China set blockchain as a national priority?

In my opinion, China’s ambition is to bolster the RMB rather than blockchain technology itself. The key driver of setting this national priority is the unsuccessful RMB globalization strategy and the competitive pressure of Libra, which is regarded as a U.S. program by many in China. So the government is seeking a way to make the RMB stronger and more acceptable globally.

Do you suppose crypto companies that left in 2017 or earlier will return to China?

The regulation of crypto businesses in China after President Xi’s statements actually intensified. There is an old saying in China, “The bandit needs to be wiped out before the regular army gets in.” I think companies that left China won’t return until the regulatory environment becomes clearer. This is hardly possible in the short term. Instead, the government is promoting adoption and application of blockchain technology in industries such as in supply chain management, source tracking in the food industry and so on. It has nothing to do with cryptocurrency.

What do you think of the PBoC’s digital replacement for cash? How do you envision the rollout happening?

PBoC’s effort on creating a digital replacement for cash is the very first step in bringing the RMB to global trade, but its target is not to replace the current digital payment system in China. It will be rolled out under pressure from Libra and other governments’ fiat digital currencies. But I think it will take a pretty long time for real implementation in China.

How has the crypto mining industry in China evolved over the past year?

It was a dramatic year for miners in China, which can be divided into three periods:

In Q1, we experienced a very inactive market. Most miners were very pessimistic, but some institutional players joined and brought new energy.

From Q2 to Q3, the mining industry was growing very fast due to the surge in bitcoin’s price. But the good days didn’t last long after the big price drop at the end of Q3 and the crazy growth of the hash rate. Lots of miners who bought mining machine futures that were set to be delivered in Q4 and the first quarter of 2020 experienced major losses.

Q4 was a bloody period for the mining industry. Manufacturers began selling at discounted prices. They also worked with crypto financial institutions (like Babel) to try to offload inventories in preparation for the new-generation miners in 2020, when I anticipate that more institutional players will come into the market.

Overall, the field has changed a lot and some new pools grew quickly. Miners are quite divided in attitude towards the coming bitcoin reward halving and we need to wait for the halving before we can give a conclusion.

Is there any effect on the crypto industry by the ongoing trade war?

The China-U.S. trade war was one of the key drivers of BTC surge during May to June 2019, but since September bitcoin is no longer the “safe haven” assets for investors worrying about the trade war after market moving favor to other categories of assets.

But when we dive deeper, it is noted that the fundamental conflict of the trade war between China and US is the currency competition. Therefore, I think the ongoing trade war has a long-term impact on the crypto industry by dragging China’s state-owned resources and corporations into this industry.

Other thoughts on the industry?

I’m still positive about bitcoin in the long term, and wish everyone would HODL. On the other hand, the crypto industry is at its very early stage, there will be lots of developments out of our expectations, just like the internet in 1980s. Let’s give it time and see.","HEX - The First High Interest Blockchain Certificate of Deposit HEX is already a success with 10k plus users, and it’s gaining more every day.

Launched in December of 2019, HEX - the first high interest blockchain certificate of deposit - is pleased to announce a very successful first month, with well over a billion dollars in Bitcoin claimed and 50k Ethereum transformed into HEX coin. Since its launch, HEX, an ERC20 token, has been the #1 - #3 app by transactions on Ethereum.

Bitcoin holders at the time of the blockchain snapshot taken at 00:00:00 on December 2, 2019 are able to claim free HEX via a BTC signature. The original rate of 10k free HEX coins per Bitcoin will continue to decay at 2% per week until nothing is left on week 50. Users will receive a 10% HEX bonus when free-claiming Bitcoin or transforming Ethereum to HEX by using this HEX.win url.

“HEX is already a success with 10k plus users, and it’s gaining more every day. The technology works great, and I am very happy with it,” commented Richard Heart, Founder of HEX. “We have a great community which is producing amazing innovation and development, and the ecosystem keeps getting better as each day passes.”

Unlike other cryptocurrencies, HEX monetizes time and is the first cryptocurrency with a chart of future circulating supply and total supply. HEX is set to inflate at 3.69% a year after day 353 to pay those who stake their HEX tokens.

Binance announced support for the national currencies in separate releases on Jan. 7. Thai digital asset exchange Satang Corporation will process Thai baht transfers, while Australian dollar transfers will be facilitated by Banxa, a company specialized in internationally compliant fiat-to-crypto gateways.

Satang’s fiat processing service is integrated into Binance’s trading platform by means of a recently launched application programming interface that allows users to deposit and withdraw baht directly to their accounts. Satang CEO and co-founder Poramin Insom said that the collaboration will help the adoption of digital assets in Thailand.

Binance noted that its partnership with Banxa also lets its users access faster fiat transfers with the Australian dollar, euro and British pound. Supported payment methods include bank transfers, bill and retail payments, and credit cards. Banxa CEO Holger Arians noted that the service also “takes care of all regulation, compliance and chargebacks.”

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said he believes that the partnership will be beneficial given the prevalence of fiat currencies and the need for means to transition from fiat to crypto:

“We believe fiat will co-exist with crypto for a long time to come. More than 99.9% of the global money supply is still in fiat and we need to continue building bridges to enable easier flow into crypto. In 2020, we aim to add support for all 180 fiat currencies.”

Binance’s fiat integration efforts

Binance, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour trade volume, has been actively adding more fiat currencies to its platform. Earlier this month, the exchange also announced that it will offer euro trading against six cryptocurrencies.

In late December, Binance started allowing users to buy crypto directly through Visa credit and debit cards after adding support for the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar earlier that month.","With the emergence of digital assets, the question has arisen whether digital assets held in “wallets” in foreign exchanges need to be reported on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets. Form 8938 is the IRS counterpart for the FBAR, or Foreign Bank Report, which certain holders of foreign bank accounts must file with FinCEN. Form 8938 was added as part of the HIRE Act at the same time the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly known as FATCA) was adopted in 2010. The penalty for a failure to file Form 8938 is $10,000. However, it is not clear that Form 8938 applies to digital assets.

The answer requires one to dig through the underlying statutes and the instructions to Form 8938. We start with Internal Revenue Code Section 6038D, which requires reporting of “specified foreign financial assets.” Under Code Section 6038D, a “specified foreign financial asset” is (1) a financial account maintained by a foreign financial institution and (2) one of the following foreign financial assets if they are held for investment and not held in an account maintained by a financial institution: (a) any stock or security issued by a person other than a United States person; (b) any financial instrument or contract held for investment that has an issuer or counterparty other than a United States person, and (c) any interest in a foreign entity. The term “financial account” means, with respect to any financial institution, (a) any depository account, (b) any custodial account and (c) any equity or debt interest in such financial institution (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market).

One issue for digital asset holders is whether a person who holds such assets in a wallet maintained at a foreign exchange is holding an asset in a “foreign financial institution.” What is a financial institution? This is defined in Code Section 1471(d)(5) as an entity that (a) accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or a similar business, (b) as a substantial portion of its business, holds “financial assets” for the account of the others, or (c) is engaged (or holds itself out as being engaged) primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, partnership interests, commodities or any interests in such securities, partnership interests or commodities. A foreign financial institution includes investment vehicles such as foreign mutual funds, foreign hedge funds and foreign private equity funds. Very generally, financial assets are securities, commodities, notional principal contracts, insurance contracts, or annuity contracts or interests in any of the foregoing. Both the terms “security” and “commodity” are defined by reference to Code Section 475, a section of the Code that was adopted in 1993, preceding the emergence of digital assets. For example, gold is a commodity under this provision, and anyone holding gold in an offshore account would need to report the account. Should the same rules apply to bitcoin or bitcoin gold held in a wallet in an offshore exchange? The IRS has not yet taken a position on whether cryptocurrency is a security or a commodity, which it could do by a regulation or a notice. This is key to the analysis of whether or not the crypto exchange is a foreign financial institution.

At least one recent, unofficial statement provides insight into the IRS’s thinking on the reporting obligation on Form 8938. Recently, according to Tax Notes, an IRS official was asked if the IRS will assess penalties against taxpayers who haven’t been disclosing digital assets on Form 8938, and the official responded that, if taxpayers had been reporting taxable cryptocurrency transactions on their returns during prior years and properly filed Form 8938 going forward, the IRS probably would not pursue them for prior tax years. Of course, this is merely an unofficial statement, and the IRS could formally decide otherwise or examiners could take different positions during the course of an exam. Either way, taxpayers that have not been reporting their cryptocurrency transactions should file Form 8938 as soon as possible and consider filing amended returns.

Information reporting is certainly a key issue for the IRS that will drive the tax compliance process. In a sign of the attention that the IRS is giving to the reporting, the draft version of IRS Form 1040, Schedule 1, now includes a question regarding financial interests in “virtual currencies,” much like the question relating to ownership of foreign bank accounts presently on Schedule B."

One of the most prominent technical analysts in the crypto community believes that Bitcoin has yet to meet one last condition before it enters the next bull market.

The Path to a New Bull Run

Peter Brandt, a 45-year trading veteran, recently expressed his views on the different factors that could lead Bitcoin to begin a new parabolic advance.

The renowned analyst maintains that the multi-year channel where the flagship cryptocurrency has been contained since 2015 was able to prevent a further drop. The lower boundary of the channel served as a significant support level allowing BTC to surge over 30%. Bitcoin went from trading at a low of $6,480 on Dec. 18, 2019, to a high of $8,440 on Jan. 8, 2020.

According to Brandt, the bullish impulse was predicted by a head-and-shoulders pattern that developed on BTC’s 1-day chart. When this type of technical pattern forms at the bottom of a bearish trend, the chances for a trend reversal increase.

Under this premise, the author assumes that the head-and-shoulders formation can be interpreted as another sign that Bitcoin will soon enter a new bull rally.

Nevertheless, Brandt pointed out that there is still one more obstacle that the pioneer cryptocurrency has to overcome before it turns bullish.

The trading veteran argues that Bitcoin needs to break out of the six-month long descending channel where it has been trading since late June 2019. Additionally, he expects that a massive capitulation by the “crypto bulls” will occur before the next bull run.

“If enough cryptocultists have been shaken out since Dec ’17, then ‘yes.’ If not, then ‘no,’”, said Brandt.

Bitcoin Technical Analysis

A look at BTC’s 1-week chart puts Brand’s analysis into perspective.

After peaking at nearly $14,000 in June 2019, Bitcoin went through a corrective phase that saw its price drop over 50%. The downward movement has been contained by a descending parallel channel.

Each time the flagship cryptocurrency hits the bottom of the channel, it bounces off to the middle or the top. Conversely, when it climbs up to the top of the channel, it plunges back to the middle or the bottom.

The most recent 30% upswing allowed Bitcoin to reach the top of the channel once again. However, the volume behind it was not significant enough to push it to break out of the descending parallel channel. If this technical pattern continues to hold, then BTC could plummet to the middle or the bottom of the channel, like it has done it over the last six months.

A spike in the selling pressure behind Bitcoin could test the 61.8% and 65% Fibonacci retracement level.

Closing below this significant area of support could trigger a massive sell-off too, sending BTC down to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $5,500. Such a bearish move could ignite the “cryptocultists” capitulation that Peter Brandt is waiting for.

It is worth noting that an increase in demand could jeopardize the bearish outlook. If Bitcoin is able to close above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $8,500, it could foster FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors. Then, BTC would likely aim for higher highs.

Moving Forward

Different technical analysts saw the move above $8,300 as a definitive sign that Bitcoin had entered a new uptrend. Meanwhile, there are those who interpreted it as a retest of the upper boundary of the descending parallel channel.

According to crypto trader Scott Melker, the different perspectives rely on traders’ bias when they first open the BTC chart. Regardless of personal preferences, Melker argues that neither idea is right or wrong as both of them offer actionable information.

Due to the ambiguity that Bitcoin presents at the moment, the $1,600 range between the 50% and 65% Fibonacci retracement level can be defined as a reasonable no-trade zone. Breaking above or below this area will determine where BTC is heading next.","In the recent development, BUX announced the official acquisition of Blockport, a European social cryptocurrency investment platform.

Bitcoin has pulled back from seven-week highs above $8,400, but the bullish breakout confirmed on Jan. 6 is still valid.

The price drop was backed by low seller volumes and may be reversed.

The bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance under key support at $7,567.

Bitcoin has pulled back from multi-week highs but is still hovering in bullish territory above key support near $7,600.

The number one cryptocurrency is currently trading at $7,910 – down 6.5 percent from the seven-week high of $8,463, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

The

pullback began during the U.S. trading hours on Wednesday with gold and other safe

havens losing ground on easing of geopolitical tensions.

“Bitcoin’s price dropped down to $8,100 (from $8,300-$8,400 range) right as President Trump announced at 11 a.m. ET that the U.S. will not escalate the conflict with Iran,” Hong Kim, co-founder and chief technology officer at Bitwise Asset Management tweeted Wednesday.

Popular analyst Ran NeuNer also put out a tweet, drawing attention to the fact that both bitcoin and gold moved lower following President Trump’s speech.

Bitcoin has moved in tandem with gold since Friday. The cryptocurrency turned higher from lows near $6,850 on Friday after the U.S. attacked Iran and clocked seven-week highs during the Asian trading hours on Wednesday. During the same time frame, the yellow metal rose from $1,530 to 6.5-year highs above $1,611.

So, it appears as though markets are beginning to treat the cryptocurrency as a haven asset, as noted by NeuNer.

That makes bitcoin vulnerable to a deeper pullback in gold, which is currently trading at $1,547 per Oz, representing a 4 percent drop from Wednesday’s high of $1,611.

The

yellow metal could slip further, possibly dragging bitcoin lower, as the

European equities (risk assets) are flashing green and the futures on the

S&P 500 are adding 0.33 percent.

That said, bitcoin’s short-term bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above key support near $7,600.

Daily chart

Bitcoin is flashing red for the second day. However, the former resistance-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders, currently at $7,567, is intact.

So,

the bullish breakout confirmed on Jan. 6 is still valid and the path of least resistance

remains to the higher side.

Healthy pullback?

Markets usually crowd out weak hands (traders with limited ‘HODLing’ power) by revisiting former hurdle-turned-support before building on a major breakout.

Bitcoin

jumped 5 percent on Tuesday, confirming an upside break of the six-month-long

falling channel. The channel breakout signaled a revival of the bull market

from lows near $4,100 seen in April 2019.

Therefore, the 6 percent pullback could be the market’s attempt to shake out weak bulls. Also, trading volumes have dropped over the last 18 hours.

Hourly chart

The price decline is accompanied by a slide in volumes. The red bars, representing selling volumes, have been small compared to the green bars or buying volume witnessed earlier this week.

A low-volume price drop is often short-lived.

The probability of a slide to the crucial daily chart support of $7,567 would increase if prices find acceptance below the 100-hour average at $7,825 on the back of strong volumes.","Philippine 'Crypto Valley of Asia' to Get Own Airport

The Philippines has a “Crypto Valley of Asia,” an initiative of the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority, the government agency responsible for managing the Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport. An airport is now being planned for inside this economic zone to address the needs of its investors and crypto service providers. Many cryptocurrency exchanges have been licensed to operate within the zone.

Airport Planned for Crypto Valley of Asia

The Philippines’ Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA) has confirmed its plans to build an airport inside its “Crypto Valley of Asia.” According to Administrator and CEO Raul Lambino, the airport will cost between $60 million and $80 million. He was quoted by the Manila Times on Thursday as saying:

The construction of a new airport is an important facility in the establishment and realization of the so-called Crypto Valley of Asia concept that we have embarked.

The CEO explained that CEZA is now in talks with the country’s Department of Transportation and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines which are responsible for licensing new airports. “We hope we will be able to realize this in the next three years,” he remarked.

The Crypto Valley of Asia is a joint initiative by CEZA and private developer Northern Star Gaming and Resorts Inc. to provide a stable and safe region for blockchain developers and crypto exchange operators. The initiative is part of the government’s bid to foster a fintech ecosystem to attract international crypto and blockchain companies to set up shop in the country. Lambino believes that it will help the Philippines “become one of the major offshoring destinations for fintech and blockchain-related work.”

Meeting Investors’ Demand

According to Lambino, investors and companies operating within the Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport have expressed concern over the lack of airport facilities since they need to get to the crypto valley as quickly as possible. However, the nearest airport to the economic zone, the Cagayan North International Airport, is 80 kilometers away. The CEO noted that a master plan and a feasibility study are currently being undertaken by an American company in collaboration with some of their local partners, the publication conveyed.

“Unless we construct an expressway, we would not be able to address the concern of investors who would want to come to the ecozone as quick as possible,” Lambino told the news outlet. He elaborated that it would cost at least P10 to P12 billion to build an expressway, concluding that building a new airport is more practical and faster to implement than constructing an expressway. “Right of way acquisition will take more than five years and thus it is more practical and more doable to construct a new airport with less cost and less time than to construct a new expressway that will connect Lal-lo to the ecozone,” he detailed.

CEZA offers two types of “Offshore Virtual Currency Exchange” licenses: the principal license and the regular license. The former allows licensees to conduct offshore fintech and crypto exchange activities, while the latter restricts them to only crypto exchange activities. Earlier this month, the authority confirmed that there are 25 financial technology principal licensees from Asia and Europe. As of September 2019, 40 companies have reportedly been licensed by CEZA overall.

Meanwhile, the Philippines’ central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), has licensed 13 crypto exchanges to operate in the country, according to the central bank’s latest list.

Given the heightened curiosity and concern, it is worth resolving some open questions around quantum supremacy for the crypto community, as there is a tremendous amount of misinformation circulating online.

Will our Bitcoin be stolen?

Many people harbor the fear that Sycamore, Google’s 54-qubit quantum processor, could outsmart the system and steal everyone’s Bitcoin. If there were to be no changes to the current implementation of the Bitcoin network, this would most likely become a reality within five to 10 years. So, while there is currently no need for users to worry, developers are well advised to commence preparations.

What’s truly alarming is that “quantum deniers” refute the reality of the problem and insist that concern should be curbed. Sadly, the exact opposite is true. We must place a collective focus on solving the issue, as complex distributed systems (does blockchain ring a bell?) are anything but easy to upgrade to a whole new crypto stack. Having spent a decade or two maturing, the ecosystem could be massively undermined if quantum computing advances to the expected degree.

Related: Quantum Computing Vs. Blockchain: Impact on Cryptography

Certainty about this stems from the fact that current encryption schemes (including those used by Bitcoin and Ethereum) have already proven vulnerable to signature forgery executable by quantum computers.

Asymmetric cryptography relies on keypairs (namely a private and public key), where the public could be calculated from its private counterpart but not the other way around. This is due to the impossibility of certain mathematical problems like factoring a number that’s a product of large primes or calculating the multiplicand of the generator that resulted in a public key, which most blockchains and cryptographic systems use.

If the calculation could be done the other way around (i.e., calculating a private key from a public key), the whole scheme breaks. All we need is more qubits and stability in these systems for such attacks to become executable.

Will Google mine away all the remaining Bitcoin?

This is another often-asked question but in reality, quantum computers are far less efficient at symmetric crypto-related computations than asymmetric crypto-related ones. As for the numbers, it takes 2^128 operations on a mainstream computer to locate a BTC private key of a given BTC public key, whereas it only takes 128^3 operations on a quantum computer to achieve the same feat.

For hashing, the difference — while still enormous — is a lot less. In essence, we need to worry more about people with quantum computers spending/stealing our money rather than fretting about Google mining the remaining Bitcoin. Even if that were the case, after successfully mining 2016 blocks, it would set the difficulty to “quantum level” — meaning that Bitcoin would only be mineable by quantum computers.

Related: Is Crypto Ready for the New Space Age?

The tricky question here is that the difficulty is hitting such levels already that miners need to wait to be able to readjust the timestamp field of given blocks because they already ran through all possible nonces for a given block without finding a result below the difficulty target. In light of this, I would venture to say that this mining-related problem is more theoretical than practical. We have already noted that time can be the limiting factor in finding a correct solution for a block, not performance, even without quantum computing-based mining.

The one thing that everyone should focus on

Should Bitcoin holders be concerned about the quantum problem in 2020? No, but there is a caveat: Cryptocurrencies (meaning their developer communities) and enterprises should focus on the issue.

What if there are quantum computers already built that are much more capable than Google’s Sycamore and we are just not allowed to know about them?

We should seek and upgrade to a quantum-resistant crypto stack in blockchain implementations and all other systems that depend on asymmetric crypto (e.g., banks, governments, etc.) as soon as possible. Quantum supremacy is inevitable — it’s just a case of when.

The proposal was made as a part of the governor’s “Making Progress Happen” 2020 agenda, where he pointed out the existing discrepancy between companies licensed under the Insurance Law or Bank Law and those licensed under FSL. While the former are required to pay assessments to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) cover regulatory costs, the latter—which include crypto entities—are not.

“The Governor proposes to amend the FSL to place such entities on an even footing with other financial services companies,” Cuomo's 318-page policy guidebook said.

The NYDFS is responsible for issuing BitLicense, a special business license for virtual currency entities operating in the state. In Dec. 2019, the agency published its plan to include two new coin listing options in its BitLicense issuance guideline.

According to an official announcement, the NYDFS has issued two dozen BitLicenses by the end of 2019. If passed, Cuomo’s amendment would increase the operation cost for all cryptocurrency entities within FSL’s jurisdiction.","The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) plans to push for more regulation around cryptocurrencies and related products as part of its 2020 focus.

“The dangers of cyberthreats to the financial system as a whole and a sound legal framework for crypto-assets are increasingly becoming areas of focus for ESMA together with the other ESAs, the ESRB, the ECB and the European Commission,” the document reads.

ESMA has been grappling with the question of how to regulate cryptocurrencies and securities in the space for years, developing rules for initial coin offerings and derivatives around the space.",

I would say the interesting question here is not the price of BTC, but whether BTC (and other main cryptocurrencies, such as ETH) will be more widely adopted on a long-term basis rather than only for a pure speculative aspect. We do not want to see a repeat of 2018, when users jumped hastily into crypto. I would prefer to see a genuine interest in the technology and its application and an overall appreciation of the utility of the tokens that support the different networks, products and services built upon the public ledger technology. And while most of the altcoins have depreciated in value over the last two years, ERC-721/ERC-1155 based nonfungible tokens have gone up, with some great examples such as Gods Unchained cards doing a 3–4x multiple or Axie Infinity Mystic creatures.

The Greatest of All Time (GOAT) Thursday, further bringing the cryptocurrency into public view as episodes this week attract almost 15 million viewers per show.

“What is Bitcoin?”

This week saw the first round of Jeopardy! GOAT, pitting champions James Holzhauer, Ken Jennings, and Brad Rutter against each other in a multi-night battle to declare who’s the GOAT of the quiz show hosted by Alex Trebek.

In Jeopardy!, chosen categories reveal an answer to a query and the contestants must phrase their response in the form of a question.

Thursday’s competition saw the category “Cybersecurity,” and the question:

“A ransomeware attack that encrypted 3,800 City of Atlanta computers demanded 6 of these digital items to unfreeze them.”

The answer, “What is Bitcoin!”

Although this mention doesn’t paint Bitcoin in a particularly favorable light, it does show that the coins are further infiltrating our popular culture and imaginations.

The question was in reference to a ransomware attack and demand for Bitcoin that destabilized municipal operations in The City of Atlanta in 2018. In the end, Atlanta, the capital of Georgia, spent more than $2.6 million on emergency efforts to respond to the pernicious SamSam malware ransom.

The other questions in the “Cybersecurity” category were as follows:

$200: This type of hacker referred to by a colorful bit of headwear helpfully tests computer systems for vulnerability. Answer: “White hat.” $400: A website with a site certificate is one that uses encryption; this letter after HTTP is one sign of it. Answer: “S.” $600: Companies consider cybersecurity when instructing employees with a policy on BYOD, short for this. Answer: “Bring Your Own Device.” $1000: Beware of these types of programs that track every stroke you make while typing in an effort to glean your password. Answer: “Keylogging programs.”

Becoming Pop Culture

This isn’t the first mention of Bitcoin on Jeopardy! In 2018, “cryptocurrency” was a category — and along with it six questions related to the coins — and a 2019 episode featured a question about associated blockchain technology.

Around the same time Bitcoin was officially added as a recognized word in the popular Hasbro board game Scrabble.

Merriam-Webster, who maintains the official Scrabble dictionary, made the addition alongside 300 other words including “emoji” and “twerk.” Placing tiles on the Scrabble board spelling out Bitcoin earns the player 11 points.

As for other TV shows, Bitcoin mentions go further back than one might imagine. The Good Wife mentioned the coin eight long years ago in 2012(!), The Simpsons in 2013, and Family Guy and Silicon Valley in 2014. Finance drama Billions also featured a Ledger Nano S in an episode published over a year ago.

Featured Image from Shutterstock","The IRS recently confirmed individuals making large donations of cryptocurrency must get those amounts appraised—stoking fears that the requirement could discourage charitable giving.

The agency updated its frequently asked questions page on virtual currency transactions in late December to add two new questions on the responsibilities and reporting obligations for charitable organizations that receive digital asset donations. One of the agency’s new answers mentions donations greater than $5,000 and the appraised value of the contributed property—indicating that individuals who make high-value cryptocurrency donations must have those amounts verified by a qualified appraiser just like most other types of donated property.

But the challenge of finding a qualified appraiser in the cryptocurrency space that meets the agency’s criteria and the cost of those valuations will discourage donations, according to crypto advocates and individuals who work with potential donors and nonprofits.

“This requirement adds an unnecessary level of complexity and will deter people from making these donations, ultimately hurting the non-profits that would otherwise benefit,” said Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, an advocacy group for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.

Some tax practitioners said the agency’s guidance shouldn’t come as a surprise because the IRS since 2014 has said cryptocurrency is property for tax purposes. But the absence of specific language requiring qualified appraisals led to speculation that donations might be exempt because the value of digital assets—at least the most prominent types like Bitcoin and Ethereum—are readily available on the exchanges they’re traded on.

“It’s way more similar to stock than it would be to a painting when you talk about appraisals,” said Pat Duffy, co-founder of The Giving Block, an organization that equips nonprofits to accept cryptocurrency donations. “They just threw up a huge roadblock that seems objectively ridiculous.”



Old Concerns Resurface

David A. Lawson, an associate at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP who advises nonprofit and for-profit clients on tax exemption and charitable initiatives, said his firm wrote to the IRS shortly after it released 2014 guidance (Notice 2014-21) about exempting crypto donations from the appraisal requirement.

Stocks and other publicly traded securities are excluded from the qualified appraisal rule. Davis Wright asked the agency to treat cryptocurrencies traded on a “major exchange""—a term the IRS would need to define—the same as publicly traded securities.

But unlike stock, which trades on one exchange open for a finite period of time, cryptocurrencies trade 24 hours a day on multiple exchanges. Without the appraisal requirement, it would be easier for people to inflate the value of their donations by using foreign exchanges, particularly those in Asia, said Bryan Clontz, the founder and president of Charitable Solutions LLC.

If the IRS did exempt cryptocurrency donations from the appraisal rule, it would need to create a standard valuation method for taxpayers to follow to reduce the potential for gaming the system, Clontz said.



Who’s Qualified?

Clontz provides appraisals for crypto donations, but he said the IRS definition of a “qualified appraiser” is an impossible one to meet for crypotcurrency. He even acknowledges the fact that he might fall short in a document provided to clients.

A qualified appraiser must earn a recognized appraiser designation, or meet certain minimum educational requirements and have two or more years experience valuing the type of property being appraised. The individual must also regularly prepare appraisals for which they are paid.

Based on a strict reading of that definition, “it is highly likely that no one would be clearly qualified as part of the IRS rule, and that’s definitely a concern,” Clontz said.

Some of the education criteria are impossible to meet because there isn’t a degree or appraisal designation that specifically applies to cryptocurrency, a problem that exists in other niche areas, such as life insurance donations, according to Clontz.

Lawson said the experience requirement can be difficult to meet because cryptocurrency is so new. That was especially true in the very early days of the technology.

“At the time, it was difficult to advise anybody that their choice of appraiser met that requirement for industry-specific experience,” he said. “Now that’s getting a little bit easier.”

The IRS didn’t return requests for comment about these issues.



Cost Complaints

Some donors, even if they find someone to do the appraisal, are deterred by what they see as high fees for the service: Most appraisers will charge hundreds of dollars for assessing cryptocurrency donations.

Essentially those individuals just have to check the price of the digital asset listed on a cryptocurrency exchange, said Alex Wilson, the other co-founder of The Giving Block.

“So they might be charging $500 to $600 for something that takes about 30 seconds and really anyone can do,” he said.

But Clontz, who charges $600 for a basic cryptocurrency appraisal, said it is not as straightforward as it might appear at first blush.

“This isn’t putting the man on the moon,” Clontz said. “I’m not suggesting that.”

But to account for around-the-clock trades on multiple exchanges, he uses the top three exchanges by volume that settle in U.S. dollars, valuing a contribution based on the 24-hour day that conforms to the time zone of the donor. He calculates the average value on each exchange, using the high and low for that day, and then takes the average of those averages. The entire process takes between two and two-and-a-half hours.","UPDATE (Jan. 10, 16:45 UTC): A previous version of this article contained incomplete information. A statement from Bitfinex general counsel Stuart Hoegner has also been added.

A class-action lawsuit alleging Tether and Bitfinex manipulated the bitcoin market has been withdrawn by the plaintiffs and re-filed with a new plaintiff in a different jurisdiction.

A document filed Jan. 7 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington shows plaintiffs Eric Young and Adam Kurtz opted for voluntary dismissal of their case against Tether and Bitfinex’s parent firm iFinex. The case was originally filed on Nov. 22, 2019.

The following day, it was re-filed in the Southern District of New York with the addition of plaintiff David Crystal.

The plaintiffs, who both claimed to be bitcoin traders, alleged Bitfinex and Tether issued inaccurate information and “monopolized and conspired to monopolize the bitcoin market.” Drawing heavily on the case brought by New York’s attorney general last April, they also accused the defendants of manipulating the market by printing unbacked tethers.

“When bitcoin prices were falling, Defendants and their co-conspirators printed USD₮s and artificially increased the price of bitcoin,” reads the original filing. “Once Defendants and their co-conspirators artificially inflated the price of bitcoin, Defendants and their co-conspirators then converted the bitcoin back into USD₮s to replenish Tether’s reserves.”

Bitfinex has previously denied the accusations, describing the case as “mercenary and baseless,” stating it would contest any “nuisance settlements”.

In a statement Friday, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel to Bitfinex, said: “Apparently the plaintiffs have determined that their action should be filed in the Southern District of New York, which raises the question of why it was filed in Washington State in the first place. Whether this complaint is filed in Washington State or the Southern District of New York, it remains entirely meritless and will be disposed of in due course.”

It isn’t yet known why the plaintiffs decided to re-file the case. According to U.S. law, cases that have already been voluntarily dismissed can never be brought before the court again if dismissed for a second time.

In November, Tether published a letter of intent to file a motion to dismiss another separate class action that seeks retribution for manipulating the bitcoin price, claiming damages of more than $1 trillion. The letter, released more than a month after the lawsuit was originally filed, claimed plaintiffs were unable to prove Tether or Bitfinex’s involvement.

While the dismissal document is not signed by the judge, the case has now been marked as terminated on Pacer, the U.S. court filings portal.

Summary:

The rapid growth of crypto assets has raised questions about the appropriate regulatory perimeter and the ability of the existing regulatory architecture to adapt to changing conditions. Effective regulation of financial services promotes long- term economic stability and minimizes the social costs and negative externalities from financial instability. The same underlying principles for regulation should apply to nascent products and services based on innovative technologies, notwithstanding design challenges.","Bitcoin's Threat to the Global Financial System is Probably at an End

Will 2020 be the year that the new threat to fiat currencies reaches maturity?

Photo by Shutterstock.

Two thousand and twenty could well be the year that the cryptocurrency dream dies. This is not to say that cryptocurrencies will die altogether—far from it. But to all the financial romantics who have cheered the rise of bitcoin and other digital currencies over the past decade, there is a reckoning coming. Like it or not, the vision of a world in which these currencies liberate money from the clutches of central banks and other corporate giants is fading rapidly.

It is not that these currencies have no place in the future of money. The encrypted blockchain technology that underpins them is extremely difficult for governments to control, so it is unlikely that they will ever be eliminated. In any case, they have a valid role to play as a geopolitical hedge—witness the surge in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies after the latest escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Iran, for instance.

Related More Than 1,000 Cryptocurrencies Have Already Failed—Here's What Will Affect Successes in the Future

But 11 years on from bitcoin’s remarkable beginnings, cryptocurrencies are a long way from supplanting the financial system. At the time of writing, the total value of all the bitcoin in circulation is $133 billion; in comparison, the market value of all the world’s gold is around $8 trillion, while the total worth of mainstream currencies worldwide is roughly the same again.

No New Hope

The so-called bitcoin maximalists foresee a day when their currency of choice rises into the top league. They point to the bitcoin “halvening” expected in May—the moment every four years when the number of new coins being added to the network is halved—as the next event that will drive prices up.

Yet the long-term prospect for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is stasis on the peripheries of the financial system. The chances of a new bitcoin look increasingly slim: It’s several years since Ethereum rose to become the prime challenger, before falling back to a fraction of the bitcoin price.

Bitcoin v. Altcoins

More important, a much bigger threat to the current system is afoot—as evidenced by Facebook’s attempts to get its Libra digital currency off the ground. JP Morgan has already launched a JPM coin for major institutional clients, while numerous other major banks are set to follow suit. Other tech giants like Amazon, Google and Apple are rumored to be looking at launching rival currencies as well.

Their model is what are known as stablecoins—a sort of crypto hybrid that lives on blockchains but is pegged to mainstream currencies. But aside from this connection to the status quo, these multinationals would be challenging sovereign money. They want to opt out of the clunky system that they have been forced to operate in, with its transaction fees and international payment delays, to present customers with an alluring alternative instead.

The reason these companies are not throwing their weight behind bitcoin et al is because today’s cryptocurrencies have at least as many drawbacks as the mainstream system. Their prices are too volatile to act as a serious store of value, for instance, while their ability to process financial transactions is not yet particularly impressive.

It has dawned on the corporate giants that as per their products or services, they can make money part of their brand—part of the customer experience. Sell people goods and services, yes, but also offer them a new monetary system to take care of the purchases. It begins to look like almost total control.

The Empire Strikes Back

The state has been late to wake up to this challenge, but has now done so in a powerful and surprising way. The traditional global infrastructure has proved strong enough to derail the corporates at least temporarily with red tape. Yet make no mistake—the goalposts have completely changed, and it will be difficult to present a united regulatory front around the world. Ironically, it is the same lack of global uniform regulatory approval for the existing cryptocurrencies that has hindered their meaningful adoption.

The other response under examination is to launch state cryptocurrencies. The likes of China and Russia are in pole position to launch the first within a couple of years. Deutsche Bank recently published a report suggesting that cryptocurrencies could overtake national fiat currencies within 10 years, envisaging that these state-backed versions will lead the charge.

In short, the future of cryptocurrency lies in either corporate or sovereign digital coins—or more likely, an uneasy cohabitation of the two. The system supposedly under threat from bitcoin and the other so-called bank killers is instead assimilating them. The coins that emerge maybe won’t even use blockchains, acting more akin to Paypal or WeChat Pay than as cryptocurrencies as we know them.

Related What to Expect as Cash Moves Out and Digital Currency Moves In

Where the previous half century saw the rise of corporates to a size and influence comparable to nation states, the next half century could produce a new paradigm in which they increasingly behave like nation states. When we reflect on the way these companies already manage our data, the way they exert lobbying influence on our governments, the trend is clearly well underway. Call it the next phase of globalization.

Money in 2030 will probably therefore be almost unrecognizable compared to what we use today. The dream of universal people-powered monetary substitutes is being crushed by this unanticipated but in hindsight inevitable institutionalization. It is from within the multinational world that the “next bitcoin” will emerge—wrapped in the liveries of a corporate brand, if not a sovereign flag. As for the great dream of bitcoin liberation, may it rest in peace.

Friday marks the deadline for the European Union’s 28 member nation-states to adopt the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive or AMLD5. The new rules require crypto exchanges and custodial service providers to register with their local regulator and demonstrate compliance with thoroughgoing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering AML procedures.

In addition to the enhanced KYC and reporting obligations, the regime gives greater power and reach to financial intelligence units and law enforcement.

These regulations represent a double-edged sword for the industry. On the one hand, the added costs of compliance may burden smaller firms in the field, and possibly force some to fold or merge.

“This will result in some closures and there are some early indications of that already, and in consolidation, where the industry starts to see M&A to scale up and meet increased costs,” said Siân Jones, director, xReg Consulting.

Already, Deribit, a Netherlands-based crypto derivatives exchange, is planning to relocate to Panama because its home country’s version of AMLD5 “would put too-high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise,” the company said Thursday.

A good deal of complexity also remains over how AMLD5 will be implemented and operated from one European country to the next.

On the plus side, the long-term effect should be greater trust in crypto from financial institutions in Europe. In particular, it should make banks more open to providing their services to crypto companies and attract more institutional capital.

“It’s part of a global trend to bring crypto in line with traditional finance; crypto is part of the global financial system, even if it doesn’t realize it yet,” Jones said.

Crypto complexity

Dispensing legislation over the EU’s 28 member states can be a lengthy and protracted business. As it stands, the accepted norms of traditional finance don’t map on to the crypto world.

While something like an emoney license in one European country can be passported into another, the AML authorization schemes regarding crypto vary across Europe; France has one approach, Germany another, the Netherlands is different again and so on.

This adds a layer of complexity when it comes to registration or authorization under AMLD5, said Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at the trade group Global Digital Finance. And if you happen to be in the U.K., Brexit throws yet another spanner in the works.

Firms may need to just do authorization or may need to do a full license or may not need to do anything, said Wright, who is also chief compliance officer at Diginex, a Hong Kong-based firm offering institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets.

“There almost needs to be a more coordinated approach to make sure it allows the industry to still flourish and offer services to residents in the EU who want to invest in virtual assets products,” he said.

In the U.K., crypto firms will need to register with the local regulator, which is the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The consultation on the proposed cost of the registration pitched fees at £5,000 (about $6,500), with an annual fee yet to be decided upon. Firms will have until Oct. 20 to carry out the registration process.

FATF effect

AMLD5 has been on the cards for a couple of years now and to some extent has been superseded by recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), first made in October 2018 and then updated in June 2019.

Where AMLD5 covers only cash to crypto transactions and vice-versa, the guidance from FATF, an international body with 39 member countries, also includes crypto-to-crypto exchanges.

Most significantly, it recommends applying payment data-sharing requirements from the traditional world to crypto, the so-called “travel rule.”

“We are seeing some member states going beyond AMLD5 and now including these wider FATF requirements, and I think that is an example, if you like, of where other events overtake some of the slow processes of bringing in EU legislation,” said Jones, citing the U.K. as an example.

“I think these FATF requirements will have a much more significant impact on crypto businesses. What might have been, to begin with, the EU taking the lead, the FATF requirements go beyond and apply globally,” she said.

Non-custodial wallets

One area of concern is the way in which an extra-restrictive implementation of AMLD5 might catch firms that provide non-custodial wallets on a completely decentralized basis.

This is something the U.K. and Germany were threatening to do, said Jacqui Hatfield, partner and head of Fintech Regulatory in the London offices of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP.

This would inappropriately include firms like ethereum-based finance platform TokenCard (which recently rebranded as Monolith) and crypto payment card provider Wirex, said Hatfield.

“Basically, they are not a custodian; they are providing the wallet facility but it’s on an open basis so they are not responsible for it. It’s actually very difficult for them to comply with this if they are not the ones who are in control of those wallets,” she said.

The FCA did not return requests for comment by press time.

“I have clients who think that the FCA is not going to go ahead with it, but no one at the FCA has actually confirmed that that is going to be the case,” said Hatfield. “I think it’s partly about being happy to gold-plate the regs and also just that they don’t really understand the tech.”

Dutch deadline

A disagreement has broken out over the definition of the term “license” in the Netherlands, where critics of the Dutch Ministry of Finance and central bank believe a disproportionately onerous version of AMLD5 is being handed down to crypto players.

Banking compliance consultant Simon Lelieveldt said the legislation is delayed because of a “serious disagreement between legislators and industry,” and that the Jan. 10 deadline will be missed in Holland.

The law is now in the Senate for discussion and this could take until the end of February or even later, he said.

“The Dutch Ministry of Finance and central bank have topped up the regular AMLD5 rules with two provisions from the financial supervision law book, which are generic umbrella clauses, allowing all kinds of investigations and measures,” said Lelieveldt.

“This [goes] against the explicit advice of the Council of State and against the text and spirit of the AMLD5 itself,” he said. “The Ministry misinformed the House of Representatives on the true nature of the law and played a word trick: by replacing the previous word ‘license’ for ‘registration’ they claim it is no longer a licensing regime.”","6 High Interest-Paying Options for Crypto Lenders

As anyone who has ever sought to lend crypto will attest, significant variance exists in the APR offered to lenders. Indeed, the spectrum can swing from 1% to 8% – even when it’s the same asset being loaned across platforms such as Coinbase, Poloniex, Compound and Dharma. As a consequence, would-be lenders seeking passive income must shop around for the best offer. Here are six high-interest options for lenders.

It Pays to Shop Around

There’s a lot of options to factor in with crypto lending over and above the quoted APR. You can choose between custodial and noncustodial, monthly, quarterly, and annual interest, and various cryptos from BTC to stablecoins. Platforms such as Loan Scan mercifully make the task easier by enabling a side-by-side comparison of the best options for lenders. There’s also information for borrowers seeking the most attractive terms. Below are some of the best high-yield options presently available to lenders.

Nexo

While the majority of lenders offer varying rates depending on the currency, Nexo is different – its 8% guarantee holds true across fiat currencies like USD, EUR and GBP as well as popular stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, SAI, TUSD, and PAX. The platform has just added EOS to the list of available collateral for its Instant Crypto Credit Lines, enabling holders to spend the dollar value of their EOS without selling it.

With Nexo, you can withdraw your funds whenever you want without penalty, just like a regular bank account. Given that 8% is the highest rate quoted by Loan Scan, Nexo’s custodial lending platform is worth your attention. All the more so if you own Terra: thanks to last year’s partnership between the two companies, Terra is offering to augment Nexo’s 8% interest rate with additional returns funded by its seigniorage model, enabling Terra holders to enjoy double-digit yearly returns on Nexo.

Celsius

Celsius almost manages to emulate Nexo by offering a fixed rate across most stablecoins: 7% for TUSD, GUSD, PAX, and USDC. The rate is well below that for SAI though, standing at 3.1%. Of course, you can collateralize non-stablecoins too, with Celsius offering 2.8% interest for ETH, 3.05% for BTC, 2.9% for XRP, and 3.15% for ZRX. A custodial system, Celsius recently hit the headlines by confirming it had handed out more than $4.25B in crypto loans last year, including over $2B in the course of 90 days. It also paid out over $5M in interest income.

Crypto.com

Acquired by Monaco in 2018, Crypto.com offers an impressive interest rate of 6% on three stablecoins (USDC, TUSD and PAX) and three of the most popular digital currencies (ETH, BTC and XRP), making it an appealing option for a broad spectrum of investors and hodlers. You can avail yourself of even better rates when you stake MCO tokens.

Blockfi specializes in providing clients with access to high-interest crypto accounts and low-cost credit products. Until recently, Blockfi only supported two currencies, namely ETH, for which the rate is 4.1% for deposits below 1,000 ETH (and 0.5% for everything above), and BTC, which stands at 6.2% for holdings less than 10 BTC, with everything above that earning 2.2%. However, in 2020 the company aims to add five to ten new assets including USDC (8.6%) and litecoin (3.78%). Be advised, Blockfi has had to cut rates more than once due to depositor demand outstripping borrower supply.

Coinlist

Founded in San Francisco in 2017, originally as a capital-raising platform, Coinlist is now all over the stablecoin market, offering the same rate of 5.84% interest on USDC, SAI, TUSD, GUSD, and PAX. It also furnishes users with 2.92% on ETH and BTC, 5.11% on ZRX, XRP and REP, and 3.65% on Brave’s BAT. It’s worth having a look at their website too, as they seem to be adding tokens all the time.

DAI Savings Rate now 6% That’s the highest it’s ever been That means you can lock up your DAI in a savings contract & earn 6% per year with no additional risk Maybe better yet… Wrap it in cDAI & earn the 6% without locking it up. cDAI can be transferred & spent!#bankless — Ryan Sean Adams – rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) January 8, 2020

It’s little wonder crypto owners are seeking to generate a passive income by putting their crypto to work via high-interest paying loans. Of course, that isn’t the only thing driving the crypto lending market: traders are also borrowing crypto to overcome capital inefficiencies. The crypto space currently offers significantly higher interest rates than the fiat world, with platforms like Cred allowing people to earn up to 10% on their BTC and BCH holdings.

Aspiring lenders seeking to profitably deploy their crypto holdings should keep an eye on interest rates, which are subject to change, and be sure to read the small print.

2020-01-11,"EU Countries Commence Crypto Regulations as Mandated by New Directive

The European Union’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive mandates that member states start regulating crypto assets by Jan. 10. Crypto exchanges and custodial wallet providers are now covered by the same regulatory requirements as banks and other financial institutions.

EU’s Regulatory Deadline: Jan. 10

The 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which amends the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, extends the EU’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financial rules to virtual currencies. The amendment was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on June 19, 2018, and mandates member states to transpose this directive by Jan. 10, 2020. The EU currently has 28 member countries.

The European Commission explained that “In the EU, credit institutions and other financial institutions are subject to obligations to apply CDD [customer due diligence] measures in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD4),” elaborating:

Directive (EU) 2018/843 (AMLD5), once transposed into member state legislation, will extend the list of obliged entities to virtual currency exchanges and custodian wallet providers.

As “obliged entities,” crypto service providers are now covered by the same regulatory requirements as banks and other financial institutions, including registering with financial authorities. “The rules will now apply to entities which provide services that are in charge of holding, storing and transferring virtual currencies,” the European Commission clarified. “These new actors will have to identify their customers and report any suspicious activity to the Financial Intelligence Units.”

The amendment also proposes that member states create central databases comprised of crypto users’ identities and wallet addresses and authorize national FIUs to access the information stored in them. “To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to obtain information allowing them to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currency,” the directive states.

EU Member States Complying

A number of EU member states have been preparing for this deadline for some time, transposing the AMLD5 into national laws. Some countries wait until the last minute to make announcements. As Brexit talks continue, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced Friday that it has become the AML and CFT supervisor of the country’s crypto-asset activities, stating:

From 10 January 2020, we are the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) supervisor of UK cryptoasset businesses.

The FCA detailed that crypto exchanges, ATMs, peer-to-peer platforms, custodian wallet providers and token issuers, including initial coin offerings (ICOs) and initial exchange offerings (IEOs), must comply with its rules starting from Jan. 10.

The Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) announced Thursday that it is now the regulator of virtual currencies in Austria. Effective Jan. 10, companies that issue, sell, transfer, trade, and exchange cryptocurrencies must register with the FMA. They include in-kind crypto service and custodian wallet providers. Registrants will comply with the due diligence and reporting obligations for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. Noting that it began accepting registration applications from Oct. 1, 2019, the regulator elaborated:

Unregistered providers may no longer offer their service in Austria from this date onwards … A fine of up to €200,000 is prescribed in the event that a provider fails to make the registration.

France is ahead of many other countries, as it adopted a regulatory framework for crypto assets in April last year. The French financial markets regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), published its new rules for digital asset service providers on Dec. 20. The AMF also recently approved the country’s first initial coin offering.

Finland started regulating the country’s crypto industry in May, and the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fin-FSA) approved the country’s first five crypto service providers, including Localbitcoins, in November.

In the Netherlands, the Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank, has been preparing to regulate crypto businesses, requesting their information in September last year. “Firms offering services for the exchange between cryptos and regular money, and crypto wallet providers must register with De Nederlandsche Bank,” the bank noted. However, the regulator said on Jan. 10 that the legislation has not entered into force.

Germany is another country that has been active in transposing the AMLD5 into its laws, which allow financial institutions to sell and store cryptocurrencies for customers alongside traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. Authorization from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) is required.

Strict Regulations Crowding Out Crypto Companies

As EU member states start transposing the new EU directive into their national laws, a number of crypto service providers have been feeling the effect of increased oversight. Some have chosen to relocate their businesses. Some EU member countries are adopting even tougher crypto rules than the new AML directive requires, such as Lithuania.

Crypto derivatives trading platform Deribit, for example, announced on Thursday that from Feb. 10 its platform will no longer be operated by Dutch company Deribit B.V. due to increased oversight. Instead, it will be operated by DRB Panama Inc., a 100% subsidiary of the Dutch entity. The company explained that complying with the new regulations would be costly and it will also have to “demand an extensive amount of information from our current and future customers.” Noting that “crypto markets should be freely available to most,” the company concluded:

The implementation of these changes would greatly affect the exchange and its customers. Therefore, we have decided to operate the platform from Panama.

Several other crypto service providers have already shut down in anticipation of the AMLD5 implementation in their countries. U.K.-based custodial bitcoin wallet provider Bottle Pay shut down on Dec. 31. The company explained that it would have to comply with the AMLD5 to remain in operation, emphasizing that “The amount and type of extra personal information we would be required to collect from our users would alter the current user experience so radically, and so negatively, that we are not willing to force this onto our community.” Crypto mining pool Simplecoin and bitcoin gaming platform Chopcoin also shut down ahead of the AMLD5 coming into effect.

While more altcoins are expected to be integrated by mining pools, the ousted co-founder of Bitmain made a legal move to dethrone Jihan Wu. Telegram confirmed that its TON Wallet won't be integrated with their messenger service, the head of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology at the WEF said that the collaboration in the blockchain industry will intensify, Japan’s Finance Minister warned the country's bankers of potential problems caused by China’s forthcoming digital yuan, Russian Prime Minister said that digital asset token regulation at a legislative level must be introduced, and a US strike on Iran test the BTC as a safe have narrative. WisdomTree Investments with Abu Dhabi Investment Office and other investors invested in Securrency, aiming to integrate blockchain into the ETF ecosystem, and BTC ETF may be approved in the US in 2021, bringing many benefits.

Meanwhile, the ICO project that closed its blockchain finalized its token buyback, COSS locked the funds of 200,000 customers during 3-4 week of ‘maintenance’, Kraken said it was hit with 710 information requests from global law enforcement agencies in 2019, Huobi Japan struck a partnership with Japan Net Bank, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared his 11 predictions for the decade. We discussed the role that Bitcoin will play in the ""retail apocalypse"" and how well Bitcoin performed as a PR project. Meanwhile, John McAfee broke up with BTC, saying his USD 1 million-per-BTC was just a ruse. There were interesting wallet solutions and many companies hoping to shine at blockchain-focused CES; we looked into how much South Korean crypto exchanges pay their employees and into how many coins died in 2019, while vintage sardines became the talk of the Cryptoverse.

Cobinhood, one of the most controversial crypto exchanges, has announced that it is closing its doors after widespread rumors of bankruptcy.

“It is with the utmost regret that we make the difficult decision to shut down the COBINHOOD Exchange,” the company posted to its Medium account on Jan. 10.

Cobinhood also posted a similar message on Twitter:

COBINHOOD Exchange is shutting down and auditing all accounts' balances from Jan 10 to Feb 9 in 2020. It will be re-opened on Feb 10, 2020. All COBINHOOD users can then retrieve their funds accordingly. Please DO NOT make any deposits; it may result in permanent loss. — COBINHOOD (@COBINHOOD) January 10, 2020

Cobinhood went live in November 2017 with the goal of serving as a high-capacity, zero-fee cryptocurrency exchange. It also branched into ICO underwriting and margin trading in the months that followed. However, it has been plagued by controversy over its short life, beginning in mid-2019 when rumors of bankruptcy surfaced.

Cobinhood’s Slow Decline

In May 2019, news sources began to report that Cobinhood and its sister company DEXON were facing bankruptcy and liquidation, seemingly based on insider information. Others accused DEXON of dumping its crypto tokens — that is, DEXON had supposedly unlocked and sold a large number of tokens just after its ICO ended.

Popo Chen, the CEO of Cobinhood, quickly denied these rumors and insisted that the company was undergoing restructuring due to disputes around financial misconduct. Though the exchange was not explicitly shut down, users reported unsuccessful withdrawals during the summer, which the company attributed to technical difficulties.

Is It an Exit Scam?

Most sources have accused Cobinhood of carrying out an exit scam, though the truth will not become clear until next month. It remains to be seen whether users will actually be compensated in February. It is possible that the relevant information will never reach the public, apart from self-reports from users who have attempted withdrawals.

However, exit scams are common: Ciphertrace reports that approximately $4 billion of funds were stolen through exit scams and misappropriation in 2019, citing Quadriga CX, Bitfinex, and Plus Token as high-profile incidents. However, Ciphertrace also noted that exit scams are on the decline — perhaps due to stronger law enforcement.","Ethereum Classic successfully completed the “Agharta” hard fork at block number 9,573,000 at 06:26 UTC on Sunday, according to etcnodes.org.

Similar to the network’s last backwards-incompatible upgrade in September, Atlantis, Agharta makes ethereum classic more interoperable with sister-chain ethereum. As part of the hard fork, the Constantinople and St. Petersburg upgrades deployed in tandem on the ethereum network last February will be enabled under Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal (ECIP) 1056.

The 20th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ethereum classic and ethereum engaged in a messy divorce following the 2016 DAO hack. Ethereum classic community members opted to not roll back the transactions enabling the DAO hacker to steal the funds; meanwhile, ethereum hard forked, partially reclaiming the hacked funds.

Three years after the split, ethereum classic has engaged in efforts to rebuild community and technical ties between the two chains, Atlantis and Agharta being two measures towards that effort.

As reported by CoinDesk, Constantinople included four ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs). Most code changes revolved around optimizations for developers, code edits for further scaling solutions and ethereum’s economic policy.

Although different chains with different visions, ethereum classic is facing similar difficulties to ethereum, however.

ETC clients evolving

According to ETC Cooperative executive director Bob Summerwill, ethereum classic is showing signs of consolidation around select clients – the full servers which process network requests – similarly to ethereum.

Parity Technologies, which recently announced its intention to step back from maintaining its code base individually, is expected to host 75 percent of the ethereum classic network as another major client, Geth Classic, is deprecated after the Agharta hard fork.

“The client diversity problem on ETC is in the opposite direction [of ETH], with Parity-Ethereum dominating,” Summerwill said in the ethereum AllCoreDevs Gitter channel. “Geth Classic is being deprecated and won’t be supported after this pending fork, and it looks like most node operators are taking the advice and migrating off.”

At time of writing, ethereum classic has 252 Parity Ethereum clients, 167 Geth Classic, 80 Multi-Geth and 1 Besu for a total of 500 clients. Ethereum classic developers, including Summerwill, expect the Multi-Geth and Besu clients to fill the gap.

Afri Schoedon, release manager at Parity Technologies and ethereum classic hard fork coordinator, told CoinDesk that client centralization is a small concern given the state of Geth Classic and available alternatives. Schoeden said Geth Classic has hardly been updated since its launch in 2016, leading to the deprecation.","2020 has gotten off to a busy start in the cryptocurrency space, with a lot of activity seen across the globe. With the first full week of the year now almost over, everyone is settling into their routines and looking for new steps in the continued advancement of crypto and blockchain. As usual, this week has seen both positive and negative events, but they are all helping to shape Bitcoin’s future.

Fintech company Longfin became one of the first companies of the new year to fall under the guillotine of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm had already been targeted by the commission for its shady practices, but its CEO, Venkata S. Meenavalli, will now have to pay fines worth $400,000 as he continues to be investigated for his prior misguided business management skills. He is also permanently forbidden from holding a position with any public company.

Crypto hardware wallet Ledger found itself defending against malware using its name when a crypto enthusiast suddenly lost around $19,500 in Zcash. The user had inadvertently downloaded from Google Play a Chrome browser extension reportedly published by Ledger, but which was actually a crypto-stealing app. There hasn’t been any word on whether or not he was able to recuperate his losses, but it’s a reminder that due diligence is paramount when it comes to protecting financial data.

In its annual report on transparency and company activity, crypto exchange Kraken revealed that law enforcement departments from across the globe are contacting the company in record numbers while looking for it to reveal personal details on specific platform users. In 2018, the exchange received 475 requests and 710 were submitted last year. Most—61%—came from U.S. law enforcement, although this was lower than the 66% seen a year earlier.

The U.S. SEC is planning on continuing its scrutiny of crypto activity this year, but it may be ready to do so in a more amicable manner. The commission’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations revealed that it is going to be looking at the space, but in ways more aligned with it being a legitimate financial sector and less as only a haven for black markets, drug deals and scams.

That revelation came just after the SEC was denied a request seeking bank records from Telegram. As it continues to fight the social media platform for allegedly selling securities illegally in conjunction with the GRAM cryptocurrency and the Telegram Open Network, the SEC wanted the company to hand over its financials; however, a New York district court judge denied the request, but only temporarily. Telegram is still required to show certain financial details, as long as the release of the data complies with foreign data privacy laws.

An exchange out of Singapore is causing a lot of grief for its users. COSS has suspended trading, explaining that the platform has to undergo maintenance. However, as has been seen in the past, the “maintenance” excuse has been used to cover up everything from hacks to exit scams. Perhaps COSS will be the exception, not the rule.

The crackdown on illegal crypto operations continues. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) shut down a crypto scheme led by Benjamin Reynolds. Reynolds was behind Control-Finance before it suddenly disappeared along with its founder and the CFTC is now trying to locate him. It has put a call out to international sources to help in the hunt, but nothing has yet turned up.

Another fraudulent operation has been broken up, as well. Dunamiscoins is found in Uganda and the company’s executives are now on trial for running a complete scam. After operating for almost two years, the firm shut down last December, and prosecutors are looking to hold the individuals accountable for their illegal activity.

The co-founder of FlashFX, an international money transfer company, says Ripple’s cryptocurrency-based remittance product is the real deal.

FlashFX is a longtime Ripple partner and was one of the first companies to begin using Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), which uses XRP to move money across borders. In a new interview with Crypto Eri, Nicolas Steiger responds to Ripple detractors who question the company’s business model.

When asked if Ripple pays FlashFX to be a client and if ODL is a scam, Steiger said his company made a strategic decision to use Ripple early on.

“For us, we’ve wanted to use Ripple for a long time. And we see the value. We still use Swift. We now use ODL. We have our own integration that we had from day one on ledger where we’re using XRP…

It’s not a scam. It solves a real-world problem. It solves a real use case. A use case that I’ve been believing in for a long time.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Steiger says regulatory red tape is one of the biggest hurdles to wider use of digital assets among banks and fintech companies.

“When a bank or organization has more certainty around the regulatory aspects and is more positive around the risk at the time of using XRP as a digital asset, then they can turn it on without anyone even knowing. It just happens. It becomes a smoother process of integrating and enabling participants using ODL.”

Ripple launched ODL in October of 2018 and says the payment solution has the potential to give financial institutions and companies a new way to move money without having to hold pools of capital in banks around the world.

To date, Ripple has opened payment corridors between the US, Mexico and the Philippines. Steiger says he’s hoping Australia, where FlashFX is based, will be next. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has teased a number of new corridors that may be in the works, but the company has yet to release an official announcement.

2020-01-12,"The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies has led to a lot of heated debates about how they should be defined and regulated.

The argument centres on whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities – and the answer could have major ramifications for the way the world of digital assets operates going forward.

This is because anything classed as a security is regulated – in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Many people argue this goes against the very nature of cryptocurrencies, which are anonymous by design, are not governed by any single authority, and aim to be free of centralised regulation.

What is a security?

To understand whether cryptocurrency is a security, it’s important to understand what a security actually is.

A security is a tradable financial asset that has monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (via owning shares), a creditor relationship with a government body or a corporation (via owning bonds), or rights to ownership as represented by an option.

The legal definition of a security varies by jurisdiction. In the US, a security is a tradable financial asset of any kind.

In the UK, the FCA’s definition of a security applies only to equities, debentures, alternative debentures, government and public securities, warrants, certificates representing certain securities, units, stakeholder pension schemes, personal pension schemes, and rights to or interests in investments.

The crypto security debate

The SEC has been fairly open in its ponderings about whether cryptocurrency is a security.

Under US law, a security includes an “investment contract” – which is defined as an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.

This is known as the Howey Test, and it essentially asks whether the value of a transaction for one of its participants is dependent upon the other’s work.

SEC chairman Jay Clayton has clarified that Bitcoin is not a security. In an interview with CNBC in June, he stated: “Cryptocurrencies are replacements for sovereign currencies… [they] replace the yen, the dollar, the euro with Bitcoin. That type of currency is not a security.”

Former CFTC chairman Gary Gensler has also stated that Bitcoin cannot be classified as a security. He pointed out that Bitcoin came into existence as mining began as an incentive in validating a distributed platform, with no initial token offering, no pre-mined coins, and no kind of common enterprise.

Bitcoin has never sought public funds to develop its technology and it does not pass the Howey Test.

Ethereum and Ripple

The position is less clear when it comes to other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP).

Jay Clayton has endorsed remarks made by his colleague William Hinman that Ethereum is not a security.

However, Gensler has warned that more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies are probably operating outside of US law and will have to come into regulatory compliance. He said that although Bitcoin is not a security, Ripple “sure seems like a common enterprise”.

A council created by some of the major cryptocurrency exchanges – Crypto Ratings Council – seems to agree as it awarded XRP a four out of five in matching the criteria considered to be a security. It pointed out that Ripple sold XRP before the token had any utility and used a securities-like language when promoting XRP.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has since hit back at critics who have been “spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt” about XRP, stating that the company’s token “is not a security”.

Speaking at the MIT Business of Blockchain conference last year, Gensler highlighted the key distinctions that could determine whether tokens are securities. In a nutshell, if a coin offering is designed to give investors an ownership stake, the token should be treated like a security and subject to regulation.

The FCA, on the other hand, recently suggested XRP is not a security because, like Ethereum, it can be used as a means of payment (exchange token) and to run applications (utility token).

Conclusion

Currently, the answer to the question “is cryptocurrency a security?” seems to be “it depends” or “sometimes”.

Certain crypto tokens do appear to pass the Howey Test. However, their fundamental goal of being autonomous and distributed networks that are designed to be decentralised is at odds with the regulated nature of securities.

What the regulators eventually decide will have a huge impact on the crypto world and its investors.","China Saw $11.4 Billion in Crypto-Based Capital Flight Last Year

On January 8, China-based blockchain security firm Peckshield published its “2019 Global Digital Asset AML Research Report” noting a variety of crypto trends throughout the year. According to the study, cryptocurrency-based capital flight stemming from China was around $11.4 billion in 2019. Peckshield’s research recorded a number of illegal or otherwise unregulated transactions over the last few years.

International Unregulated Capital Flow Using Cryptocurrencies Surges in 2019, While China Saw $11.4 Billion in Capital Flight Crypto Transactions

In January 2017, the Chinese government and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) banned domestic cryptocurrency exchange operations. However, despite the ban, Chinese citizens have been able to access digital assets via over-the-counter platforms and offshore exchanges. Peckshield, a blockchain research firm from China, published a report which shows Chinese residents are still leveraging cryptos on a regular basis.

According to the study, roughly $11.4 billion in capital flight crypto transactions derived from China. The number is less than 2018’s $17.9 billion but more than 2017’s $10.1 billion. 2019’s unregulated capital flows from China represent more than 1% of the country’s foreign exchange reserves. Peckshield’s study notes:

International unregulated capital flows: The flow of funds using digital assets as a carrier has been huge internationally, but the legal definition of digital assets such as bitcoin in different countries is still very vague, meaning that these liquid funds have not been reasonably regulatory compliance.

MLM Crypto Scams and Darknet Market Bitcoins

Peckshield’s research utilized full nodes from a variety of blockchains and parsed the public data storage files deriving from chains like BTC, ETH, EOS, and TRX in real-time. The study also highlighted the major multi-level-marketing crypto scams that plagued China and many other regions worldwide. Peckshield mentioned how the Ponzi Onecoin managed to siphon $4 billion before the scam ended. The study also emphasized the Plustoken project which managed to defraud Chinese and international investors by running away with more than 200,000 BTC, 780,000 ETH, and 26 million EOS. Peckshield’s research notes that 3 million people were scammed by Plustoken and “the impact is very wide and the damage is huge.”

In addition to detailing the capital flow from Chinese citizens using cryptocurrencies, Peckshield’s report discusses darknet market (DNM) bitcoin growth. Peckshield claims there are about 60,000 darknet websites running on the invisible web and DNM transactions spiked considerably in 2019. In 2018, Peckshield data shows that 334,329 BTC flowed into DNMs but the following year the number jumped to 546,825 BTC.

Peckshield’s deep web research stressed the firm analyzed DNM page structures, content, and discovered a large number of digital asset addresses used within the invisible web. Out of the 546,000 BTC, Peckshield discovered that the total number of BTC flowing directly from DNMs into major exchanges was 29,471 BTC. The study emphasizes that only a small fraction of DNM funds flows into major trading platforms but small amounts of DNM funds are sent to exchanges every single day.

Peckshield’s report has five separate chapters of comprehensive crypto data in regard to DNM money flow and capital flight from an array of countries like China. The researchers note that overall BTC circulation on the invisible web is growing but it’s a “relatively stable amount determined by market demand.” On the other hand, “the current unregulated asset flow has occupied a considerable market share.” In Peckshield’s opinion, “accelerating compliance has become an urgent matter” as far as the global digital asset environment is concerned.

What do you think about the capital flight leveraging cryptocurrencies in China? What do you think about Peckshield’s data in regard to DNM funds in 2019? Let us know what you think about these topics in the comments section below.

On an old building near North High School, a banner sign reads “Crypto Currency Training Center of Akron.” Small business owner Todd Brenn of Tallmadge is developing the place. He wants to demystify Bitcoin. He began researching digital currency in 2016, after using it on an online poker site that only accepted Bitcoin. He says that since cryptocurrency is not backed by a specific country, and lives only online, it can help people to participate in the economy who might otherwise not have access to traditional banking services. And he says that holds true whether discussing economically depressed cities like Akron, or third-world countries.

“They’re building the infrastructure right now to digitalize identity systems [and] put property rights and put things in place to where they can contribute to the economy. Once these infrastructures are built, our economy is going to have a big boost.”

Brenn prefers to call the training center a “community” instead of a “school,” since he wants it to be an open exchange of ideas.

“I can’t even keep up with all the things that are going on in the industry. There’s so many projects coming online and so many good ideas. If we, together, learn this industry, people can come to me and start saying, ‘hey look at this project’ or ‘look at that project.’ And we can find opportunities and learn the industry together.”

Brenn says he’ll offer classes, a newsletter, online videos, and public events for people to learn and share information about digital currency. An official opening is slated for March.","The cryptocurrency market has been heating up for the past few years. As such, 2020 could well be the year when the crypto industry goes into overdrive.

According to DappRadar’s 2019 Industry Review, Ethereum’s most popular applications all came from the world of gaming. At the same time, so-called “Ethereum Killers,” like Tron and EOS, struggled to compete.

Leader in the Ecosystem

Etheruem’s DeFi break out has been one of the hottest trends in crypto. But as more data from 2019 begins to roll in, the evidence suggests users may be more active elsewhere.

Compared to competing smart contract platforms, DappRader reported broad user activity within the DeFi, Exchanges, Gambling, and Gaming sectors on the Ethereum blockchain. This activity was measured along two metrics: daily active unique (DAU) wallets and daily value.

Based on the above, one can see that while DeFi and Exchanges produced the most value, user activity was much higher in the Gaming and Gambling sectors. Gaming in this context refers to developers adding features that interact with Ethereum rather than entire games.

The popularity of in-game purchases and digital trading cards is the best example of this. As mentioned, however, the meteoric rise of games like CryptoKitties, Gods Unchained, and My Crypto Heroes generated minimal value in US Dollar terms.

HyperSnakes enjoys the second highest volume traded at ~$5,900, while the other two games are not listed within the top 10.

At the time of press, the top three Ethereum games include My Crypto Heroes, Knight Story, and HyperSnakes. Each platform reports ~3,000, ~790, and ~580 active users within the last 24 hours respectively.

The comparatively high user activity may also mean that gaming is still the easiest medium for users to understand and thus interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

The DappRadar report reads:

“Despite all the press coverage [Gods Unchained] gained for selling out its Genesis card packs over a 12 month period, the $6 million raised in the process is a great success, but looks not substantial compared to the value created by other dapp categories.”

In the DeFi space, for instance, total user count is perhaps the lowest of the four categories, but the amount of money locked up is magnitudes greater than the gaming space. Indeed, the biggest news is DeFi, which reported a jump of almost 1,990% in growth last year.

Compound, a breakout application in this sector, enjoys a volume of $2.1 million within the last 24-hour window. The number of daily unique wallets, however, is under 200. This data means that only a small number of Ethereum wallets are enjoying the benefits of this wave of blockchain-based finance.

Although, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) reported continued user growth, DappRadar excluded them from the DeFi category. For reference, Kyber concluded the year with over 600 daily unique wallets, thus earning the title of most popular exchange. This isn’t much compared to centralized exchanges, but it’s indicative of growing attention.

Across all four categories, DappRadar reported an overall increase of 118% in the dApp ecosystem and an increase of 166% in terms of US dollars. Neither EOS nor Tron boast the same figures.

For its part, Tron is almost exclusively used for gambling dApps with the report indicating both high value accrued and high daily usage. It should also be noted that “gambling dApps typically generate a lot of bot traffic,” according to DappRadar.

This activity is made even easier on platforms like Tron and EOS due to the consensus algorithm they use. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPos) is very cheap to interact with once wallets are made. This creates a much lower barrier to create multiple wallets and record activity.

Even DappRadar reported that “much work has been done by DappRadar and other companies to discover and filter out such traffic, but it’s impossible to entirely remove it.”

The above data shows that EOS accrues most of its value via exchange activity. It is also striking to see that this value is generated by only a few active wallets.

Gambling is also popular on EOS, but the Other category is still the most popular. In this context, Other refers to dApps that leverage airdrops to attract users and makes up “around half the daily activity on EOS [dApps].” This marketing technique is still widely used on the EOS blockchain to attract users.

Concluding, Ethereum is still dominating the dApp market despite uncertainty surrounding the launch of the Ethereum 2.0. It is still possible that they lose their foothold, but the brand is well established. The blockchain continues to report the highest amount of developer activity, and the DeFi narrative will likely continue this trend.","White House Market Wants to Become the Darknet’s Toughest DNM

White House Market (WHM) is an ultra-secure darknet market (DNM). It disallows Javascript, enforces PGP throughout, admins key sign every 72 hours, and only accepts monero (XMR). It might be the darknet’s most private market. But do its vendors deliver? News.Bitcoin.com dusted down some XMR and decided to find out.

Also read: How to Encrypt Messages With PGP When Using Darknet Markets

A Fortress in the War on Privacy

“All transactions on the blockchain can be traced due to blockchain’s immutability,” begins surveillance firm Bitfury in its December report on darknet interactions. That’s not quite true, for while public chains like bitcoin can be inspected by anyone with a block explorer or forensic analysis tool, monero provides no such luxury. That’s why its usage is enforced on White House, one of the several dozen DNMs competing for market share.

Empire, the darknet’s most popular market, has been struggling under heavy DDoS attacks for weeks, believed to be the work of a slighted ex-vendor, “Stackz420,” who’s gone so far as to publish a script so that anyone can join in the assault on its servers. Just to add to their woes, Stackz420 has attempted to dox Empire’s operators and exposed security holes in the site. Empire survives for now, but given its extended periods of downtime, it seemed opportune to give a different DNM a try.

White House is locked down like a fortress, with enough security measures to keep amateurs at bay, but enough tutorials to ensure the determined can get inside and ply their trade. It’s an opsec obsessive’s paradise.

What’s Inside the White House?

The homepage for WHM lays down the house rules from the get-go. For starters, you need to upload your PGP key just to be able to browse. You also need to add the site’s public key to your keychain to verify the signed messages from its operators attesting that they are still alive and supplying mirror links for the market.

Exit scams occur almost monthly on the darknet, with Grey Market the latest site to disappear. Even with frequent message signing, there is no way of verifying the integrity of White House’s operators, and thus it too could fall by the wayside. The use of mandatory encryption throughout, however, coupled with direct payments between vendors and buyers, limits the possible fallout.

After logging into the site, you must decrypt a PGP message using the private key you associated with your WHM account. It contains a code that you enter to verify your pseudonymous identity.

A Darknet Safety Charter

On its About page, White House Market lays out the security measures it has in place, which functions are encrypted, and what information is retained in plaintext. It explains: “We assume that any server can be hacked or seized eventually, so we don’t want to keep more data our servers then we need to.” PGP and monero private keys are reportedly not kept on the servers.

Under “Security Considerations,” detailed advice on maintaining good opsec, both online and offline, is provided. This includes the invocation not to reuse usernames/passwords/PGP keys over multiple darknet markets, finishing: “Under any circumstances do not use on darknet any username / nickname / moniker / password / PGP key that you may use or may have used on the clearnet or in real life, not even something similar. It’s the fastest way to get caught.”

Although PGP can seem complex at first, once you’re accustomed, it adds mere seconds onto DNM purchases, and the peace of mind it buys is well worth it. While other DNMs employ optional PGP, White House enforces it, preventing users from getting lazy.

Buying Monero to Buy Darknet Goods

In reviewing WHM, I had no monero to hand but did have some BTC in a noncustodial Bitcoin.com Wallet. I sent it over to accountless crypto changer Flyp.me and within half an hour had its XMR equivalent in a noncustodial Monerujo Android wallet. For similar privacy guarantees and a slightly better exchange rate I could have alternatively traded BTC for XMR on exchange.Bitcoin.com.

As a newer darknet market and one with a stricter door policy, WHM has fewer listings than the market leaders; a little over 4,000 products in its drugs category, and around 6,000 across all categories. This will grow, though, if the site sticks around and builds up trust. In the meantime, there’s enough listings to cover most bases, territories, and tastes. Many vendors have yet to accrue much feedback, but some have ported their PGP key and with it their rep over from other DNMs.

I order something fragrant for testing purposes, from two different sellers, and receive a PGP encrypted message containing the seller’s XMR address. I must decrypt it with my own key, or I can scan in the wallet QR code. A BTC option is available at checkout, but WHM discourages its usage. I send the XMR from my Monerujo wallet and within 10 minutes my transaction has cleared and within 48 hours the package is on my doorstep. Financial freedom and the free exchange of goods and services is a beautiful thing.

Bitfury estimates that $920M of BTC poured into darknet markets last year, with other cryptos likely taking that total past the $1 billion mark. “Unfortunately, we see that the annual flow of funds to darknet entities is increasing,” finishes Bitfury’s darknet report. Fortunately, we have private cryptocurrency and there’s nothing Bitfury and their surveillance sisters can do to stop it.

Do you think darknet market sales will increase this year? Let us know in the comments section below.

Researchers at Princeton University have demonstrated that five major phone carriers are highly vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks.

The team revealed the results of their experiment in a draft paper published Jan. 10. They also surveyed over 150 websites and determined whether user accounts could be accessed through such an attack.

Phone Carriers Are Not Secure

SIM swapping is “low-tech but devastating,” according to Arvind Narayana, an author on the paper.

As Narayana explains, attackers can contact a phone carrier, impersonate their victim, and transfer the victim’s service to their own SIM card. This allows the attacker to intercept verification codes through SMS and access the victims’ website accounts.

Princeton researchers attempted 50 SIM swaps by creating simulated identities and persuading carriers to reassign each account to a new SIM card. All 10 swaps involving AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon accounts were successful. Six Tracfone swaps were successful, and three US Mobile swaps succeeded. 39 of 50 attempts were successful overall.

The team additionally noted that AT&T, Tracfone, and US Mobile revealed personal data without authenticating the caller—including billing addresses, activation dates, and payment dates. Though that information alone does not guarantee a successful SIM swap, it could help attackers correctly guess the answers to security questions.

Researchers stated that they followed responsible disclosure procedures and submitted their findings to all five phone carriers. They also notified CTIA, a wireless communications trade agency.

So far, only T-Mobile has explicitly updated its security practices, but it is possible that other carriers have done so as well.

Crypto Exchanges Have Mixed Security

SIM swaps do not necessarily give attackers access to victims’ online accounts. As such, researchers assessed 156 websites to determine whether they were secure. They found that 83 sites were “insecure,” or accessible with a password and SMS verification. 17 sites were “doubly insecure,” or accessible with SMS verification alone.

The researchers included several cryptocurrency exchanges, online wallets, and crypto-related websites in their survey too.

Most of these sites offer secure two-factor authentication setups that do not rely on SMS verification. However, many crypto websites offer insecure account configurations, as seen below:

Why Crypto Accounts Are Targeted

SIM swapping and SMS verification can be used to target any sort of account, including bank accounts and social media accounts.

However, crypto exchange accounts are also quite profitable. Over ten cases of crypto theft related to SIM swapping have been reported in the past year, cumulating in tens of millions of dollars in stolen funds.

Sometimes, attackers operate serially. One particularly high-profile attacker, Joel Ortiz, stole more than $5 million of cryptocurrency in 2018. There are also plenty of big targets: Sean Coonce, the engineering manager of BitGo, lost $100,000 in a SIM swap attack that targeted his personal Coinbase account in May 2019.

Change might be on the way, however. Victims of SIM swapping have highlighted the issue by suing AT&T over negligent security practices.

Lawmakers are taking an interest as well: U.S. Congress asked the FCC to introduce protections against SIM swapping this week. But for now, individual security practices are the only true preventative measure.",
2020-01-13,"Opportunist traders admit they want tensions between Iran and the USA to escalate in order to cash in on cryptocurrency price spikes that occur during military conflict.

The price of oil and gold rose dramatically within hours of the US airstrike which killed Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad on January 3. The drone attack also appeared to push the value of BTC upwards from what had been a drawn-out slump to below $7,000.

By the time news of the attack fully emerged, Bitcoin had shaken off its post-Christmas hangover and looked set to be building for a challenge on the $8,000 mark.

During the following days of military posturing, according to a Coin Rivet exclusive for the Daily Express, the trading volume escalated as investors across the globe began piling savings into cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin’s price – at great odds with the trend it had established in the lead up to Christmas – continued to build before another lurch skywards in the moments after news broke of Tehran’s retaliation in the early hours of January 8.

In an instant, BTC was surging to a high of $8,400 – a figure many would have seen as impossible only a week earlier.

Despite the threat of war and bloodshed, several crypto traders have admitted to cashing in on the conflict with little care for the potential wider consequences of international unrest.

Threat of war

One such trader – known as ‘BT_C_gal’ on crypto platform BitMEX – explained she had no qualms about making money on the back of the threat of war.

“I’m not responsible for the air strikes, I’m not launching any missiles, and I’m not killing anyone, so I don’t see what possible harm I’m doing by making a profit out of my positions,” said the trader, who purportedly hails from Scotland.

“I’ve been trading in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin since 2016 and have a good sense of when and how something’s going to go up or down.

“That’s just a skill I’ve developed and has no bearing on the rights or wrongs of war. It’s not as if I’m profiteering from conflict, because that’s a question you should be asking of arms manufacturers and the interests they hold.”

Another trader – ‘Vitza5032’ – wasn’t quite so thoughtful on the matter. Instead, the ‘London-based’ user was keen to express his desire for further conflict.

“If it’s making me money I don’t care,” he said.

“More bombs, more missiles, more international disruption – it all helps me to decide when and where I place my trades and I have no problem with it.

“The more anarchy and disruption we have, then the more people invest into crypto and that just suits me fine. If Trump and Boris want to start a world war then bring it on.”

True to form, since last Wednesday’s peak, the cryptocurrency markets have mirrored the international narrative.

Olive branch

As both the US and Tehran offered the glimmer of a veiled olive branch by the weekend, Bitcoin’s price began to fall. An apparent ‘stepping back from the brink’ on both sides was matched by a steady decline from $8,300 to below $8,000 before rising and falling again over the last two days during political unrest and civilian protest.

Following a weekend of discontent after Iranian officials admitted launching missiles at a Ukraine International Airlines plane that crashed, killing all 176 on board, protestors took to Tehran’s Azadi Square.

Iranian police have been accused of using live ammunition against the protestors who were appealing for international peace.

The protests seemed to see the markets form a steady decline before US President Donald Trump waded in with a tweet to Iran.

Within the tweet, he wrote “…the world is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching” in an apparent veiled threat that further military action was not off the table.

Bitcoin’s value rose almost instantly, touching $8,200 before settling again to where it currently stands at around $8,100.","The price of bitcoin (BTC) has risen once again after a successful launch of CME’s bitcoin options surpassed rival Bakkt on its BTC futures contracts in the first day of trade volume.

On Jan. 14 at around 00:30 UTC, the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value rose above an area of resistance that had stifled previous rallies near $8,200 for over a week beginning Jan. 7.

This comes several hours after the successful launch of Chicago-based derivatives exchange CME’s futures contracts for BTC, which surpassed rival Bakkt in reported volume within its first day of trading.

Global Head of crypto trading giant Cumberland, Chris Zuehlke said institutional investors are seeking traditional risk management tools to support greater entry into crypto.

“As with any new financial product, we expect volume will grow organically as investors get more comfortable trading it,” Zuehlke said.

An option on a futures contract gives a holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific futures contract at a strike price on or before the option’s expiration date.

Joshua Green, head of trading at cryptocurrency trading firm Digital Asset Capital Management, said the rise in BTC’s value was “nothing obvious” citing a potential short-squeeze.

“Maybe some negative gamma from spot moving through that strike (of $8,250) or people covering shorts that were put on in a notification of Chinese New Year sell-off,” Green said.

Justin Chow, global head of business development at Cumberland said BTC’s recent rally was being led by altcoins, specifically BTC forks such as Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash.

“While the CME BTC Options launch corresponded to the move, BTC forked coins and other altcoins that have upcoming halvings are the strongest performers,” Chow said.

Cryptocurrency futures trading volumes have now outpaced spot markets on Binance, according to a report issued by the company.

Users Turn to Futures on Binance

The report, titled “Leverage and Derivatives: Overview of Binance Futures in 2019,” details the success of the Binance Futures offering since it was launched in September last year. Futures now account for around 75% of the total Bitcoin (BTC) market volume traded on the exchange.

Binance was a relatively late entrant to the crypto-derivatives markets, at least compared to rival exchanges such as OKEx and Huobi, which started offering futures contracts from 2017 and 2018, respectively. By the time Binance entered, these two exchanges already accounted for 76 percent of all crypto-derivatives trading.

Nevertheless, in the four months since launching Binance futures, the trading giant has made significant headway in the crypto-derivatives space. The report claims that market share has grown from 2.5 percent in September to 13.7 percent in November.

However, the fact that derivatives trading now outperforms the spot markets by threefold is perhaps the most intriguing data presented in the report.

Charts show BTC futures dominate 75 percent of overall trading, while Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash futures account for around 50 percent and 67 percent of their markets, respectively.

Not a Global Trend

In the broader cryptocurrency markets, trading volumes of crypto-derivatives have also increased rapidly over the past year or so, but not yet to the extent of outperforming the spot markets.

According to data aggregated by Skew, Jan. 8 was the highest-volume trading day for BTC futures in the past month, with trading volumes exceeding $22bn across all exchanges. On the same day in the spot markets, BTC trading volume didn’t fall below $28bn, according to CoinMarketCap.

So why is futures trading on Binance apparently proving more attractive than spot trading?

One reason could be that Binance offers higher leverage than many other platforms. In October, Binance upped the ante against its rivals by introducing 125x leverage on its BTC contracts. At that time, BTC futures saw a steep increase from 50 percent to 70 percent of total volume traded.

A tweet shared by Skew earlier today appears to back this theory, indicating a steep drop in trading volumes on Bitflyer after the exchange reduced limits on leveraged trading in May last year. The move came as a result of pressure from Japan’s FSA.

Volumes are mostly a function of leverage – see what Bitflyer's did last year when the FSA reduced max leverage from 15x to 4x on the 28th of May pic.twitter.com/eGa9VCFiKx — skew (@skewdotcom) January 13, 2020

British regulators have also expressed concerns about the risk created via high leveraged trading. This resulted in Kraken Futures imposing a 2x leverage limit on retail traders located in the U.K.","They're finally here. Exchange-traded bitcoin options launched Monday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Traders of all stripes have been desperate for exchange-traded options on bitcoin because options can be used to define risk while expressing nearly any market thesis and it is that ability to limit losses that is so important in bitcoin, which saw a 1,900% rally in 2017 followed by an 82% break before bottoming late in 2018.

Traditional options allow the buyer of the option to purchase the underlying asset in the case of a call option or sell the underlying in the case of a put option. Options on futures are just a bit different in that the owner of a call option has the right at option expiration to take a long position in the bitcoin futures contract traded at the CME, while the owner of a put option has the right to take a short position in those bitcoin futures.

Regardless of the underlying instrument, the ability to define risk comes at a cost. Options on bitcoin futures are incredibly expensive as you would expect from anything with this sort of volatility. Traders usually refer to the cost of an option in terms of ""implied volatility,"" or the amount of volatility implied by that current price of the option.

Options on bitcoin futures are implying an extreme amount of volatility. Just after midday on Monday, the $8,000-strike put options expiring in April were trading at 72% implied volatility, suggesting that traders believe bitcoin is likely to be between $6,965 and $9,940 when those April options expire. That's a range of 37% with bitcoin futures at $8,130. In comparison, the at-the-money April options for the S&P 500 are trading below 12% implied volatility.

The buyer of a $9,000-strike call option expiring in April would have to pay about $1,075 for the call, meaning bitcoin futures would have to be above $10,075 for that call purchase to be profitable at expiration. The buyer of an $8,000-strike put option expiring in April would have to pay about $1,165, meaning bitcoin futures would have to be below $6,835 at expiration for the put purchase to be profitable. That would really require some movement.

Until options on bitcoin futures gain a deeper following, any trader will face a market — meaning the bid for any option and the offer price for that option — that is very wide. For example, the market for those April $8,000 put options is about 250 points wide.

That doesn't mean option sellers will have it any better off. The seller of a naked call option would face unlimited losses if bitcoin were to resume the rally it enjoyed in 2017.

Options on bitcoin futures will likely be a great tool for speculators in the cryptocurrency space. Speculators in other asset classes have known for a long time that options offer the ability to limit losses and create unique payoff profiles. And it's always good for investors and speculators to have more options.

Disclaimer","In early 2009, an anonymous developer (or group) launched the cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin.

This developer went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In the years since, the technology that makes Bitcoin possible has taken on a life of its own, and numerous other cryptocurrencies have sprung up to compete with it. To an outside observer, today's cryptocurrency market might appear to be little more than a group of similar offerings all competing for the attention of investors.

Major types of cryptocurrency

There's quite a bit of variance between today's cryptocurrencies. They rely on different versions of the original blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin, and not all of them are designed to function like fiat currencies. Making sense of it all requires careful study and a fairly extensive understanding of how cryptocurrencies work under the hood.

As a guide for those not immersed in the intricacies of crypto-technology, here's a look at the four major types of cryptocurrency, and what they're good for.

4 types of cryptocurrency Proof of Work (PoW) Proof of Stake (PoS) Tokens Stablecoins

1. Proof of Work (PoW)

To get started, the first type of cryptocurrency is the one that began with Bitcoin, which relies on blockchain technology that uses a concept known as proof of work (PoW) to process transactions. To understand what that means, though, you first have to understand what blockchain is.

Put simply, blockchain is a distributed ledger system. On a blockchain network, every participating computer (called nodes) maintains a complete copy of the system's ledger. It's a bit like sharing a copy of a check register with multiple people – except that no individual member can add something to that register alone.

To add a transaction, nodes compete to solve a complex cryptographic problem that represents the data to be added. The first to solve the problem then broadcasts the answer to the rest of the network for verification. This process is what has commonly become known as mining because the node that gets the right answer first gets a reward from the network. It's a secure and self-policing way of keeping airtight records.

The security of blockchain technology, besides making cryptocurrencies possible, is also making its way into other industries of all kinds. Walmart is using it to manage its produce supply chain, Maersk is using it to track shipping containers as they travel the globe, and even the diamond industry has adapted it to track precious stones as they move through the value chain.

The upside of PoW

That process is the work referred to in proof of work. The proof part is the follow-up process of verification by the rest of the network. That's what keeps the complete ledger both valid and agreed upon by all parties. It's a system that's inherently secure and robust because the only known way to compromise it would be for a single actor to control more than half of all nodes (making it possible for them to make changes at will).

The downside of PoW

The major downside to a PoW blockchain system is the sheer computing power it takes to function. Since every node has to work on every transaction, simply adding nodes has no effect on the total speed or throughput of the network. For that reason, PoW systems don't scale well and are somewhat inefficient. One study even found that the blockchain network alone consumes the same amount of electricity as the city of Las Vegas, which may present an obstacle to its continued dominance in the crypto market.

Cryptocurrencies using PoW

Right now, the two major cryptocurrencies that rely on proof of work also happen to be the biggest, in terms of market value: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Together, they have a market capitalization of around $150 billion, a figure that dwarfs all other competition. As the legacy technology of the cryptocurrency world, PoW has proven stable and resilient, powering the two aforementioned currencies to unheard-of values in the past few years.

2. Proof of Stake (PoS)

The major problem with PoW systems is the fact that they don't scale well. To overcome that problem, a different consensus model for blockchain was developed that allows smaller pools of nodes to validate transactions. It's known as proof of stake (PoS), and it ensures security in a fundamentally different way than PoW.

In a PoS system, not every node must validate every transaction. Instead, participating nodes have to use their own cryptocurrency holdings as a deposit to join a transaction validation group. That deposit is where the concept of proof of stake gets its name. Any node that tries to cheat or pass bad data into the ledger automatically forfeits their stake as a penalty. Those that play by the rules receive interest on their deposits as a reward for their work. In a PoS blockchain, that's the incentive system that keeps things secure and operating fairly.

The upside of PoS

As you may have guessed, the main upside of a PoS blockchain is processing speed. Since participating nodes can split up into smaller groups to work on individual transactions, cryptocurrencies that use it gain the ability to operate using parallel transactions which mean lower processing costs. The importance of that can't be overstated.

Even Ethereum, one of the main pillars of the PoW crowd, is already in the middle of shifting to a PoS blockchain. They see it as the only way to avoid the eventual bottlenecks that will bring ever-expanding PoW systems to a virtual standstill.

The downside of PoS

The major downsides of PoS blockchains are that they're theoretically less secure than PoW systems, and they run the risk of becoming far less decentralized over time. On the security front, the threat of a participant forfeiting their stake only works as a deterrent if their stake is greater than what they would gain by breaking the rules. If, for instance, a node succeeded in adding a fraudulent transaction to the blockchain in an amount greater than their stake, the incentive to do the right thing would disappear.

The other problem relates to how much of a PoS cryptocurrency each node controls. The larger their holdings, the more transactions they can become involved with, and the more interest they collect. That could create a snowball effect where the most powerful nodes become even more powerful over time, eventually coming to dominate the network itself. Since one of the key draws of cryptocurrencies is that they're not under any centralized control, that could prove to be the Achilles heel of the PoS cryptocurrencies at some point in the future.

Cryptocurrencies using PoS

Right now, there are several cryptocurrencies that rely on PoS blockchains. The most notable among them are Eos, Dash, and Tron. Although they are tiny when compared to the PoW behemoths, that's about to change in a big way. That's because as mentioned earlier, Ethereum's about to join their ranks within the coming year. It's also worth noting that the vast majority of new and planned cryptocurrencies rely on PoS, as it's seen as the future of scalable blockchain technology.

3. Tokens

The two cryptocurrency types we've covered so far have been distinguished from one another by the technology that powers them. That's not the only kind of difference you'll find in the market, though. There are also differences in the purposes of the various offerings on the market. That brings us to the next major cryptocurrency type: tokens.

Tokens are distinct from traditional cryptocurrencies in that they're not intended to be used as general-purpose currency. They're also created on top of existing blockchains, such as Ethereum, and do not exist as stand-alone systems. In a way, the simplest way to understand the concept is to think about the chips you use to place bets in a casino. While they represent cash or other assets of value, they may only be used in the specific casino who issued them.

For example, online music streaming service Musicoin facilitates direct payment from listeners to artists using a token called Music. The token itself is built using the Ethereum blockchain (which is home to the majority of tokens), and cannot be converted directly into fiat currency. Instead, artists paid in this way must convert their tokens into standard cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum before cashing out their earnings.

The upside of Tokens

As you might imagine, there are a wide variety of use cases for crypto tokens. Since they can be used to represent assets or units of value, they're perfect for single-purpose applications built atop existing blockchains to provide liquidity in illiquid markets. Real estate is a classic example of that idea. By representing real estate holdings as tokens, owners can swap property shares as they might trade stocks or bonds. Tokens are also being put to use in commodity markets, such as energy trading and the like.

The downside of Tokens

When used as a simple medium for exchange, crypto tokens work quite well. The problem, however, tends to happen when trying to extract value from whatever ecosystem the token belongs to. As mentioned earlier, tokens can't be exchanged directly for fiat currency, so it's difficult to pin down their exact value at any given time. In addition, they're also at the mercy of whatever happens to the underlying blockchain they're built on.

If that blockchain suffers an attack, it would affect all associated tokens. Also, if the underlying blockchain makes a technical change (like the aforementioned Ethereum switch to PoS), it can have wide-ranging implications for all associated tokens.

Major Tokens

Oddly enough, there are so many tokens currently in existence that it would be impractical to list them all. To the general public, however, there are two worth mentioning – BAT and Tether. BAT, which stands for Basic Attention Token, is used as a payment system within the recently-released Brave web browser. The idea is to compensate users for viewing online advertising as a means of changing the current equation which has led to rampant use of ad blocking technology.

Tether, on the other hand, is a token whose sole purpose is to remain at a value that's on par with the US dollar at all times. It's also a member of the next group of cryptocurrencies we're about to discuss: stablecoins.

4. Stablecoins

As the name suggests, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies created for the sole purpose of providing reliable value storage. They came about because standard cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether (the Ethereum coin) can fluctuate wildly in value over a short span, making them difficult to manage. That's the reason that some crypto-investors have become multi-billionaires overnight, only to see their net worth evaporate almost as quickly.

Stablecoins represent something of a hybrid between tokens and standard cryptocurrencies, in that they are built on existing blockchains but may be exchanged for fiat currency. Within the market, they play a vital role in allowing day-to-day, repetitive transactions that are free from value swings. Most stablecoins achieve this feat by pegging their value to one or more fiat currencies, and keeping reserves of those currencies as a guarantee of the token's value.

The upside of Stablecoins

One of the major roadblocks to the integration of cryptocurrencies into the wider world economy is the volatility that is their hallmark. That has made it difficult for banks to work with cryptocurrencies, for retailers to accept them as payment for goods and services, and for individuals to use them as a savings vehicle.

Stablecoins like Tether (which is pegged to the US Dollar) are now used by crypto exchanges as their default storage medium for investors – kind of like a tokenized fiat currency. Without them, it would be very difficult for investors to buy and sell crypto-assets because of the need to pull out holdings to avoid losses.

The downside of Stablecoins

The major downside of stablecoins is the fact that holders of the coins must rely on the companies that manage them to keep real cash reserves to guarantee their value. There's been some question, in particular, about Tether's practices with regard to its currency reserves. Since stablecoins aren't government-backed, there's nothing to stop one from blinking out of existence due to poor management.

Major Stablecoins

Besides Tether, which represents almost 90% of stablecoin trading volume, there are a few more examples in the market today. The most well-known among them include Paxos, Gemini, and TrueUSD.

There is, however, another stablecoin on the way that has grabbed the spotlight in recent months. It's Libra, the Facebook-backed cryptocurrency that sparked controversy when plans for its debut became the subject of a Congressional hearing this past year. Still, if Libra can clear the regulatory hurdles, it might become the dominant stablecoin almost overnight – changing the face of the cryptocurrency market in the process.

The crypto bottom line

By now, it should be obvious that there's more to cryptocurrencies than meets the eye. It's a diverse market that is made up of the four distinct groupings covered here, as well as some types of coins and tokens that blur the lines between them. It's also worth mentioning that it's a market that's in near-constant flux. As proof, consider the fact that nothing you've read about in this article existed prior to 2009 – and most of the developments like stablecoins and proof of stake are much more recent than that.

For that reason, it's easy to forecast that the four cryptocurrency types detailed here won't be the last. In fact, there's a good chance that they'll be replaced by newer variations in the years ahead. Still, it's worth understanding things as they stand today. It'll form the basis of an understanding that will help you grasp the changes that are sure to take place in the near future and leave you well prepared to embrace the crypto future that's unfolding in front of our eyes.

If the plan goes through, the new leverage limit would be 2x from the current self-imposed cap of 4x, Japan Times reported Saturday, citing “informed sources.”

The FSA has reportedly proposed the move due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency markets and regulations in Europe and the U.S. The plan also follows discussions with the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, the country's self-regulatory authority.

Margin trading allows trading instruments using borrowed funds. It can help multiply profits, but can also lead to multiplied losses. Some exchanges, such as Binance, offer leverage of up to 125x.

Japan’s proposed rule, if passed, will be included in a Cabinet Office order linked to the revised Financial Instruments and Exchange Act expected in spring, per the report. Accordingly, cryptocurrency exchanges will have to revise their offerings.","SANTA BARBARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CipherTrace, the leader in cryptocurrency intelligence, announced that, in partnership with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Middlesex University London, and the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation (BAF), it will launch the CipherTrace Defenders League. Together, the collaborating entities will empower students with training and tools to investigate crypto-related scam and fraud cases, helping to make the crypto economy safer.

The Defenders League will initially consist of graduate students from Middlebury and Middlesex and BAF students at nine universities in California. CipherTrace will train and certify students to use its powerful financial investigation software. With access to the full suite of CipherTrace tools, certified students will be able to trace funds lost in cryptocurrency fraud and theft. In exchange for class credit, students will provide services to help recover “small” losses that are typically too small for law enforcement to investigate.

CipherTrace also announced an upcoming series of CipherTrace Certified Examiner (CTCE) training events globally with boot camps also taking place in Monterey, London, Frankfurt, Singapore, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. By participating in these one-day training events, attendees will gain the skills required to become expert cryptocurrency financial investigators. Remote training events will also be available each month.

“We've experienced a significant increase in requests for investigative and analytic support for fraud and theft cases,” said Pam Clegg, the director of investigations and education for CipherTrace. “The CipherTrace Defenders League will be an elite corps of blockchain knowledgeable students who can conduct smaller-scale investigations. Their objective will be to produce actionable intelligence and evidence that can be used to recover stolen funds and ultimately prosecute those criminal actors responsible for the losses.”

In addition to free CTCE training, CipherTrace is providing a $4.3 million software grant to the Defenders League to help these students visualize blockchain interactions and follow the money. CipherTrace Cryptocurrency Intelligence analyzes blockchains to trace over 800 currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin and Litecoin.

“The partnership between Middlesex University, London and CipherTrace has enabled Digital Forensic students to develop cryptocurrency investigation skills using the full CipherTrace commercial tool,” said Sukhvinder Hara, senior lecturer in digital forensics at Middlesex University London. “Being the only UK university with commercial crypto investigation software enhances our students’ employability, particularly as they can certify as CipherTrace Certified Examiners.”

“The Middlebury Institute’s Financial Crime Management program aims to equip the next generation of compliance and intelligence professionals with the most state-of-the-art skill set,” according to Professor Moyara Ruehsen at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California. “The CipherTrace Defenders League provides our students with hands on experience researching and solving live financial crime cases using cutting-edge tools, allowing them to hone their skills while also performing a valuable service.”

“The students of the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation are passionate, educated and motivated to help grow the crypto economy,” said Cameron Dennis, president and founder of the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation. “This will provide students valuable real-world blockchain analytics experience using industry leading cryptocurrency tools to help victims recover stolen and scammed funds.”

As reported by CipherTrace, thefts, scams, and fraud had already topped $4 billion by the end of Q3 2019, emphasizing the urgent need for solutions to fight crypto crime and protect individual investors. The establishment of the CipherTrace Defenders League marks a significant step forward toward CipherTrace's goal of making crypto a safe, trusted and broadly adopted asset class.

About the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation

Probably you are aware already of the concept of Bitcoin mining. The name fits, because the process is similar to mining for other commodities, like gold, for instance, which is mined from the earth, and eventually makes new currency available. Mining is used to introduce Bitcoins into the system.

Bitcoin stands out. It has many advantages and cannot be compared to any other digital currency. There are, however, some flaws to this form of currency and it is important to discover what these are. If you were going to become actively involved in playing casino games, it pays to become better informed first. So let’s start with Bitcoin.

Advantages of Bitcoin

Payment Ease:

Using Bitcoin it is possible to send or receive money anywhere on the planet any time, night or day. That is a huge advantage.

The usual limitations don’t exist when transferring money across the world. Having to take into account festivals and holidays, for instance, is not part of the equation.

You are the only one in charge of your money. There is no controlling authority in the Bitcoin system.

Security/Control Issues:

Bitcoin is a safe network as users are in control of their transactions.

It is not possible for traders to charge the consumer extra fees and have it go unnoticed. Any extra fees need to be discussed with the consumer first.

It is not necessary to supply personal information when making payments in Bitcoin. The transaction can be finalized without this information.

It is not possible for people to see your personal information which makes Bitcoin safe from identity theft.

Your money is safe with Bitcoin owing to Bitcoin’s back up procedure.

Transparency:

All completed transactions are accessible to everyone but personal information is not available.

Your public address is what is viewable. Your personal information is not.

Because of the Bitcoin blockchain, anyone can verify transactions at any time.

The system cannot be tampered with by anyone or any organization because Bitcoin is cryptographically secured.

Fees and Charges:

At the present time there are no, or very limited, fees connected with Bitcoin payments.

In order to get the transaction processed quicker, users might introduce fees. The higher the fee, the quicker it will move within the network. It will get prioritized.

The use of digital currency exchanges that convert Bitcoins into fiat currency (legal tender, backed by the government that issued it) is helpful to traders. Bitcoin service charges and fees are usually much less than those of PayPal and credit cards.

Less Risks for Traders:

It is not possible to reverse a Bitcoin transaction. These transactions are secure and do not contain personal information. It is, therefore, safer in instances where fraud may occur.

It is possible to trade even where levels of fraud and crime may be high. This is due to the Bitcoin blockchain, or public ledger which makes cheating very difficult.

The above are the basic advantages. There are three particular disadvantages that need to be looked at. It is important to know both the pros and cons and what to expect from Bitcoin.

Disadvantages of Bitcoin

Awareness and Understanding:

There is still very little awareness and knowledge about digital currencies. Not that many people have heard of Bitcoin.

In order for people to benefit from Bitcoin and apply it in their lives, they need to become more educated and learn more about it.

More networking is vital to get Bitcoin out there and have people talking about it.

More businesses are getting involved with bitcoins as there are many advantages for them but the list remains pretty small in comparison to physical currencies.

It is good that we see companies such as Tigerdirect and Overstock accepting Bitcoin as payment. But it is just as important that their employees understand and are educated in the use of digital currencies. If not, they will not be able to help and direct customers on the use of Bitcoin for their transactions.

Educating workers about Bitcoin needs to be made a priority. Only this way will they be able to help their customers. This may take time and hard work but workers do need to understand what digital currencies are. Without this knowledge, it makes no difference whether large companies accept Bitcoin as their staff don’t understand what it is.

Risks and Instability:

There is a volatility to Bitcoin because of the limited amount of Bitcoin available and the daily increasing demand for them.

However, we will see with time this volatility will diminish.

Also, Bitcoin prices will become more stable as more businesses and traders begin to accept it as a means of payment.

At the moment Bitcoin’s daily price fluctuations are caused by events occurring within digital currencies.

Development Stage:

Bitcoin is still in its early stages of development with many of its features still in progress.

In order to ensure that the use of digital currencies becomes safer and accessible, new services including new tools and features are being developed and tested.

Bitcoin still has some way to go in its development until it reaches its maximum potential.

Bitcoin is still in its early stage and like any other new currency, there may be teething problems and issues that need to be worked out.

In Conclusion

So, we have pointed out the pros and cons of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not perfect but it does have certain plusses that are not available with physical currencies and are very useful to users. Even though there are some disadvantages these are mainly because Bitcoin is still in its early stages of becoming a new currency. Awareness is still growing, albeit rather slowly. People are gradually becoming more educated as to what digital currencies are all about and what they can offer them.

Everything in life is full of pros and cons. It is always a matter of weighing up the options. Deciding on the advantages and disadvantages before making a final decision. It will benefit you to learn all the facts about Bitcoin. Acquiring knowledge is always in your best interest.","With New Regulations, Europe’s Crypto Companies May Be Running Out of Options

European crypto companies are finding themselves in a changing regulatory environment. The new realities they have to deal with stem from the fifth edition of the European Union’s anti-money laundering directive. AMLD5 introduces stricter customer due diligence requirements and some in the industry have realized their business models, based on key principles of the crypto space, are hardly sustainable under the new rules.

Netherlands to Introduce Licensing When New Directive Requires Only Registration

Although the amendments had to be transposed into national law by Jan. 10, 2020, member-states are at different stages of their implementation. The approach to complying with the Pan-European directive also varies between countries with some governments opting to expand their regulatory frameworks beyond what Brussels requires at this point. Several EU nations have indicated this is the direction they want to move in and the Netherlands is one of them.

The new Dutch legislation transposing AMLD5 is yet to enter into force. The bill prepared by the government is more restrictive than the directive requires, Luuk Strijers, CCO at Deribit, told news.Bitcoin.com. The Amsterdam-based crypto derivatives exchange announced recently its decision to relocate to Panama because the “new regulations would put too high barriers for the majority of traders, both – regulatory and cost-wise,” the company detailed on its website.

The Senate of the Netherlands is scheduled to discuss the new law on Jan. 28, 2020. Strijers pointed out that the draft framework has the characteristics of a licensing regime, while AMLD5 dictates the obligation to register instead of obtaining a license. “If Deribit falls under these new regulations, this would mean that we have to demand an extensive amount of information from our current and future customers,” the executive said and emphasized:

We believe that crypto markets should be freely available to most, and the new regulations would put too high barriers for the majority of traders, both – regulatory and cost-wise. The implementation of these changes would greatly affect the exchange and its customers.

Therefore, Deribit have decided to operate their platform out of Panama. From Feb. 10, 2020, it will be assigned to a new entity, DRB Panama Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dutch company, Deribit B.V. “The team and leadership will remain the same, with John Jansen as the CEO,” noted Luuk Strijers. All open client positions, holdings, equity, trade history, fees, rate limits, wallets, portfolio margin arrangements, and other system settings will be transferred from Deribit B.V. to DRB Panama. The platform’s servers, which will also remain the same, will be moved to London. The Deribit CCO explained:

We considered multiple other (EU) jurisdictions in an elaborate regulatory review performed over the past period and came to the conclusion that Panama is the best option for our clients.

Crypto Companies Can Run but Can They Hide?

Despite the relocation, however, certain changes regarding Deribit’s due diligence procedures will be implemented. “As of Feb. 10, 2020 our new KYC requirements will be applicable to all our clients, so our European clients will have to meet the same requirements as clients from (most of the) other counties in the world,” remarked the company executive. Like up until now, residents and citizens of the United States will not be allowed to trade on the exchange. Clients will have to accept DRB Panama as their new contracting partner under a new set of terms and conditions in order to continue to use the services provided by Deribit.

Although various changes in the global regulatory landscape do not apply to Panama, Deribit will introduce two KYC levels. All current users will initially be registered as Level 0 clients, which comes with some restrictions. Withdrawals will be limited to up to 1 BTC per 24 hours. Providing a passport or other government issued ID will raise user status to Level 1, remove the withdrawal limit and unlock portfolio margining, for example. Deribit will use a solution by Jumio aimed at providing client identity verification and services by blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis to monitor transactions for anti-money laundering purposes, Strijers revealed.

The announcement, the company representative assured, “has received positive response from our clients as it clearly outlines the strategy going forward and addresses concerns they might have had.” Deribit’s decision to change the jurisdiction from which it operates shows that relocation can be a solution, but only a partial one for crypto companies that want to keep their privacy-sensitive clients happy. In a world where most governments abide by global standards adopted by international organizations such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and customers’ residence matters, moving a platform to a different jurisdiction is not likely to bring much change for its users.

In December, U.K. crypto payments provider Bottle Pay announced it’s ceasing operations because of the latest update in the EU’s anti-money laundering regulations, despite raising $2 million in seed funding a few months earlier and expanding its user base significantly. “We have taken the painful decision to shut Bottle Pay down completely rather than become subject to these new regulations,” the company stated in a blog post, explaining that “the amount and type of extra personal information we would be required to collect from our users would alter the current user experience so radically, and so negatively, that we are not willing to force this onto our community.”

Panama is one of the alternative destinations suggested to Bottle Pay by members of their Telegram channel. “How come BottlePay can’t just move operations to a new jurisdiction outside of the UK like say Panama?”, asks one of them. “That’s what I also was curious about. But I guess that even they will gonna move to the different jurisdiction people who would want to use bottle in the Europe through the twitter or whatever will not be allowed to do that,” comments another. “So, Malta certifications will not help”…

“Wow sounds more like prison than citizenship,” the conversation goes on. “Bitsahara sent compliance notices yesterday. I can’t help but think that this is EXACTLY everything crypto was created to fight,” remarks someone else. “Why you don’t want to hire attorney to help avoid this stuff?” queries another member, to which Bottle Pay founder Peter Cheyne replies: “we were working on it for months behind the scenes. so we already pursued those kind of avenues, and the feedback led us to the decision we made last week … the trade offs would have been substantial.”

Several other crypto companies operating in Europe have shut down so far due to the new EU regulations, including crypto mining pool Simplecoin and bitcoin gaming platform Chopcoin. News.Bitcoin.com’s questions about Bottle Pay’s plans for the future are as of yet unanswered by the group at the time of publication. On a positive note, however, the Get Started page on its website currently states: “Effortless Bitcoin payments will be back soon.”

2020-01-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - The cryptocurrency arm of Fidelity Investments, one of the world’s largest investment managers, has launched its first foray into Europe, opening a new front in efforts to drag digital money into mainstream investing.

Fidelity Digital Assets will act as a custodian for bitcoin held by London-based cryptocurrency investment firm Nickel Digital Asset Management, the two companies said on Tuesday.

The lack of back-office services like custody offered by major financial firms has been one reason that large investors across the world have held back from involvement in the highly volatile but potentially lucrative emerging asset.

Yet it remains to be whether the provision of such services alone by firms like Boston-based Fidelity, which has $7.8 trillion under management, will pave the way for an influx of mainstream money into cryptocurrencies.

Big pension funds and asset managers remain highly sceptical of digital currencies because of their patchy regulation and reputation for hacks, heists and other crime, despite the large potential gains on offer.

Bitcoin BTC=BTSP almost doubled in value last year, buoyed by expectations of growing mainstream use. Yet bitcoin markets are dysfunctional and plagued by double-digit price swings, opaque price discovery and patchy liquidity.

Facebook's FB.O high-profile attempt to draw cryptocurrencies into the mainstream with its Libra coin has met with regulatory scepticism globally, with France and Germany pledging to block the currency from operating in Europe.

Fidelity Digital Assets’ Europe head, Chris Tyrer, said the hurdles to participation in cryptocurrency markets by institutional investors - regulation, as well as the quality of service providers and high volatility - were gradually becoming lower.

“We see those three factors slowly resolving themselves, and as a result we are seeing a pick up in institutional investor interest,” he told Reuters. Harmonised regulation in the European Union would be useful for service providers, he added.

Tyrer said his firm was attracting interest from family offices, wealth managers and some cryptocurrency companies. He declined to say how much money it manages or how many clients it had.

Launched in 2018, Fidelity Digital Assets offers cryptocurrency trading and custody services for financial firms and corporations. In November it was given the nod by New York’s financial watchdog to offer its services to companies in the state.","A U.S. judge has appointed a receiver to oversee a Bitcoin plant in Montana after the majority owner was indicted on federal charges alleging he was running a Ponzi scheme involving cryptocurrency investments.

U.S. District Judge Brian Morris on Friday appointed retired U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremiah Lynch as the receiver for CryptoWatt in Butte, The Montana Standard reported. Lynch will oversee the company's finances and assets.

Minority owner Kevin Washington and operator Rick Tabish requested the court appoint a receiver. They argued the owner, Matthew Goettsche of Lafayette, Colorado, wasn't paying the bills, which threatened the entire operation, including 32 jobs.

CryptoWatt is behind in paying its power bill to NorthWestern Energy, threatening the viability of the plant, Washington said. Maintaining that transmission contract is key to the operation.

Bitcoin mining requires significant power usage to run specialized computers that process and record transactions in exchange for virtual currency. A Bitcoin was worth $8,748 on Tuesday. Its value peaked at $19,783 in late 2017.

Morris' order directs Lynch to enter into a loan agreement between CryptoWatt and Washington to provide funding for at least three months, to secure all Bitcoin mined by CryptoWatt and negotiate any contracts necessary to keep operating the plant.

The order allows Lynch to collect $22,500 a month for his services.

Goettsche, 37, is charged in New Jersey with conspiracy to engage in wire fraud in connection with his role in BitClub Network. The network solicited money from investors in exchange for purported shares of cryptocurrency mining pools, prosecutors said. He was arrested in Colorado.

Four attorneys listed for Goettsche in court records did not immediately return an email from The Associated Press seeking comment Tuesday.","San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is expanding into Australia via the acquisition of a domestic crypto exchange, the firm confirmed to The Block.

The exchange announced Tuesday that it acquired Australia-based Bit Trade, one of the longest-running crypto companies in the country. The deal follows Kraken's acquisition of Circle Trade, which closed at the end of 2019.

Together, the two acquisitions will allow Kraken to expand its presence into the Asia-Pacific regions of the crypto world.

Bit Trade operates a so-called multi-exchange aggregator, which combines liquidity from several exchanges into one interface.

As such, the deal will enable Kraken to offer its customers a more robust trading experience, enabling them to route orders to various pools of liquidity, according to Kraken.

Coinbase held acquisition talks with Tagomi, a prime brokerage firm, in what would have been a similar deal, as The Block first reported.

The Bit Trade deal brings Kraken's total number of public acquisitions to five for 2019 and 2020. Last year, in a ""nine-figure deal,"" Kraken acquired Crypto Facilities, which it rebranded as Kraken Futures. In total, the firm has publicized 10 acquisitions since its founding.

Following are Kraken's deals from 2019 and 2020:

As part of the Bit Trade acquisition, Kraken is bringing on Jonathon Miller as a managing director for Kraken in Australia.

Kraken sees $126 million trade on its venue during a 24-hour period.

Editor's note: This post has been updated to reflect that Kraken made 10 of its acquisitions public, not 5.","Investors who are interested in diversifying a portfolio with alternative assets may consider the expansion of the cryptocurrency universe and the outlook for crypto and blockchain technology in 2020.

In the recent webcast, Bitcoin In 2020: What Financial Advisors Need To Know, Matt Hougan, Global Head of Research, Bitwise Asset Management, pointed out that while cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, may exhibit extremely volatile fluctuations compared to traditional assets, investors have been heavily rewarded over time. Specifically, bitcoin traders suffered through a 72% price decline in 2018 but enjoyed a 92% return in 2019, compared to the 31% gain in the S&P 500, 22% for MSCI EAFE, 18% for MSCI EM and 18% gold. Over the past three years, bitcoin registered a whopping 650% return, compared to the S&P 500’s 52%. For the past five years, bitcoin surged 2,208%, compared to the S&P 500’s 71% advance.

This alternative source of return may be especially important ahead as we witness slowing growth in traditional stocks and bonds. Morgan Stanley projects traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolios will post gains of about 2.8% per year for the next 10 years, which would mark the lowest 10-year return for such a portfolio in almost a century.

Furthermore, the cryptocurrency returns exhibit low correlations to equities and fixed-income markets. Specifically, bitcoin has a -0.06 correlation to the S&P 500 and a -0.01 correlation to the U.S. Aggregate Bond Index while ethereum has a -0.04 correlation to the S&P 500 and a +0.05 correlation to the Agg.

Bitcoin is also experiencing greater regulatory approval and is going mainstream. The CME bitcoin futures market is now the largest single bitcoin market in the US. The regulated market shows average daily trading volume increased 75% in 2019 over 2018. There is now 40 million blockchain wallet users and 6% of Americans currently own bitcoin – the number coinbase accounts that trade cryptocurrencies is now 2.5 times the amount of accounts on Schwab’s brokerage platform. Bitcoin exhibits processes more transaction volume than PayPal at $1.3 trillion.

In the recent Bitwise and ETF Trends 2020 Benchmark Survey of Financial Advisor Attitudes Toward Crytoassets, 10% of independent RIAs indicated that they owned crypto in their personal portfolio, followed by 3% of financial planners, 2% of broker dealers and 2% of wirehouse representatives. About 34% of individual clients also said they invest in crypto on their own. Looking ahead, around 42% of financial professionals said they plan to increase allocations to crypto.

Financial professionals highlighted the benefits of adding cryptoassets to a portfolio, including low or uncorrelated returns with other assets and high potential returns. However, they also showed some apprehension to digital currency due to regulatory concerns, volatility, how to value cryptocurrencies, lack of accessibility, lack of understanding and custody concerns, among others.

Hougan pointed out that bitcoin is being utilized as a geopolitical hedge or alternative asset to traditional stocks and bonds, especially during periods of heightened volatility. In August 2019, bitcoin prices and trading activity spiked in response to rising tensions in the US-China trade relationship as many turned to bitcoin as a type of new safe-haven asset. This new role was further solidified when bitcoin’s price surged in response the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani.

“This is a significant narrative that we believe will meaningfully drive bitcoin’s adoption by investors in 2020 and beyond,” Hougan said.

Furthermore, Hougan underscored the improving fundamentals, notably on the supply side. In May 2020, the amount of new bitcoin issued each day will drop by 50%. This “halving” phenomenon in the cryptocurrency market occurs once every four years, and it has historically preceded significant bull markets.

“The effects of supply reductions on crypto prices aren’t immediate; it takes time for the impact to build,” Hougan said. “Nonetheless, removing a significant portion of new supply reduces persistent selling pressure, and can have a meaningful impact over time.”

On the demand side, Hougan argued that Facebook’s push to open up crypto to billions of its users could further support the case for digital currencies.

As a way gain exposure to this up-and-coming market, Bitwise Asset Management created the world’s first cryptocurrency index fund and offers two low-cost, liquid beta funds, holding bitcoin and ethereum exclusively.

The Bitwise Bitcoin Fund and the Bitwise Ethereum Fund are the second and third strategies in the Bitwise fund family, joining the broad-market Bitwise 10 Private Index Fund. The funds is driven by inbound client interest and investor dissatisfaction with existing options, many of which carry premiums, charge exit fees, have lockups, and/or charge expenses to the fund outside the stated management fee.

The Bitwise Bitcoin Fund holds bitcoin and captures the total returns available to investors in the world’s largest cryptoasset, including any meaningful hard forks and air drops. The Bitwise Ethereum Fund does the same for ether. Funds safeguard holdings in 100% cold storage with an institutional third-party custodian, and prepare simple K-1 tax documents for investors each year.

Chair Heath Tarbert told Cheddar Monday his agency is helping create a regulated futures market investors would be able to “rely on” for better “price discovery, hedging and risk management.”

“By allowing [cryptocurrencies] to come into the world of the CFTC,” investors can better access trusted and regulated financial products, improving overall confidence in the asset class, according to Tarbert. “It’s helping to legitimize [digital assets], in my view, and add liquidity to these markets.”

The marketplace for cryptocurrencies derivatives is expanding. Although still dominated by unregulated exchanges, it is gradually facing greater competition from regulated alternatives. Bakkt launched physically delivered bitcoin futures last September and CME, which first launched bitcoin futures in December 2017, opened trading for options contracts Monday.

In the interview, Tarbert reiterated that his perspective will only extend to cryptocurrencies the CFTC currently classifies as commodities. Appointed chairman last April, he has advocated for an open regulatory regime when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

In an op-ed published on the CFTC website November, Tarbert argued regulators should adopt a greater “principles-based approach” to the asset class. “The trick with digital assets is to foster the development of exciting new products while mitigating potential risks,” he wrote.

Rather than the regulator issuing prescriptive rules that companies need to follow, companies should develop commercially viable solutions that satisfy regulatory standards, he said.

The CFTC first defined bitcoin as a commodity in 2015, confirming the classification when it gave the go-ahead to CME and Cboe to launch regulated futures at the close of 2017. Ether was only confirmed as a commodity last October when Tarbert said that, as it hadn’t been treated as a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), “it stands to reason” that it is most likely a commodity.","For one week, the Iran–United States military crisis gripped the crypto community. It began on Jan. 3 with a U.S. drone strike on a convoy traveling near Baghdad International Airport, killing Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) soared.

As reported by Cointelegraph at the time, there is strong evidence to suggest that BTC’s price surge from $7,000 to nearly $8,500 is strongly linked to the tensions between the two nations. For example, the push toward $8,500 took place at the same time as mainstream media began to report on a retaliatory attack by Iran on the American forces based in Iraq.

According to data from Google Trends, the search term “Bitcoin Iran” surged 4,450% in the seven days to Jan. 8, Cointelegraph disclosed. The crisis spurred a surge in cryptocurrencies, the Nikkei Asian Review proclaimed, as “migrant workers and investors turn to ‘digital gold’ as financial conduit and safe haven.”

Nigel Green, CEO of the United Kingdom’s deVere Group, said on the matter: “This latest Bitcoin price increase underscores a mounting consensus that Bitcoin is becoming a flight-to-safety asset.”

Related: Bitcoin Is Becoming More Valuable to Iranians Amid Tensions With US

After U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Jan. 8 that he would seek no further military action against Iran following its U.S. air base bombings, the crisis was effectively over. At that point, it seemed that the BTC price retreated to the $8,000 mark, as reported by Cointelegraph.

All is quiet on the Iranian front, for now. That said, the crisis arguably inspired some new respect for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — and also raised some questions.

Will more investors flock to crypto now?

“With an escalation in geopolitical turbulence, which typically unsettles traditional markets, it can be expected that a growing number of investors will decide to increase their exposure to decentralized, non-sovereign, secure currencies, such as Bitcoin,” commented Green. This new hedging group will include retail and institutional investors.

One might, indeed, see heightened demand for Bitcoin after the past week of tensions in the Middle East “as investors in the region may look to move funds away from traditional investments such as gold or global bonds,” Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA, told Cointelegraph. He added:

“Bitcoin may have seen a bottom put in place, and some investors may feel more confident that Bitcoin can reach $10,000 a lot easier than gold can return to its 2011 record highs just above the $1,900 level.”

Opinion isn’t uniform, however. Sima Baktas, founder of GlobalB Law told Cointelegraph that global tensions will play a big role in the short term, adding that:

“It's important to remember that if Bitcoin becomes too popular a commodity in a country where the capital outflow is bringing down the local currency [e.g., Iran, Turkey] , it could become a victim of its own success and see the government step in to clamp down on investment.”

Did the crisis confirm that Bitcoin has become a flight-to-safety asset?

Green’s assessment on Bitcoin becoming a flight-to-safety asset has some qualified support, but not all agree completely. Moya believes that it may take some time before the assets may be counted as equals:

“Bitcoin at times has rallied alongside other well known safe-havens [e.g., gold, the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen], but it is far from becoming a more traditional flight-to-safety trade. Bitcoin lost most of its safe-haven trade allure after regulatory concerns grew in both China and the U.S. in the last half of the past year.”

“For many Iranian traders, there is more hope in the consistently volatile nature of Bitcoin than in the consistently inflationary nature of the Iranian Rial,” GlobalB Law’s Max Lurya told Cointelegaph, adding:

“That’s not to say that Bitcoin is perceived as a flight-to-safety asset, as Bitcoin is not considered a low-risk investment relative to gold or silver.”

This isn’t the first time BTC price has surged during geopolitical tensions recently. “In August, it jumped as global stocks were rocked by the devaluation of China’s yuan during the trade war with the U.S.,” noted Green.

When Cointelegraph asked Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, if his view of Bitcoin had changed significantly as a result of the Iran–U.S. crisis, he answered:

“Yes, it has. It was quite profound to see Bitcoin acting as a clear safe haven in the face of a global risk event.”

Is BTC digital gold?

“Bitcoin jumped 5 per cent as news of the strikes broke around the world on Friday,” observed Green. “Simultaneously, the price of gold — known as the ultimate safe-haven asset — also moved higher.”

Bitcoin is living up to its reputation as “digital gold,” Green continued: It is a store of value like gold and is perceived as being resistant to inflation like gold, and, as a result, “it could potentially dethrone gold in the future as the world becomes increasingly digitalized.”

Again, Green’s sweeping view was endorsed only up to a point by others in the crypto community. Greenspan, for instance, wrote in a Jan. 6 newsletter, “The resemblance between digital gold and the physical stuff [BTC-GLD] is uncanny. They've basically been moving in a very similar pattern throughout most of last year.”

This is a departure, noted Greenspan, because, until recently, Bitcoin has been seen mostly as an uncorrelated asset that does not react directly to what's happening in other markets. As reported by Cointelegraph, during the crisis, the price of oil also surged by 4% to just under $72 per barrel, while Dow Jones, S&P500 and Nasdaq saw slight pullbacks. That said, it may be premature to call BTC the new gold. Greenspan told Cointelegraph:

“Gold has been a backbone of the global economy for thousands of years and is a much more reliable safety asset. Bitcoin is only a decade old and still presents all kinds of existential risks. The hope is that it eventually becomes the new backbone of the digital economy, but it’s too early to make such a claim now.”

Will developing nations embrace crypto when tensions rise?

As has been widely reported, economically troubled Venezuela is a hotbed of crypto activity. As recently as December, Venezuela and Argentina set new peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volume records, as citizens reportedly attempted to mitigate the inflation risks. However, one must be careful about generalizing from one country’s experience as Lurya told Cointelegraph:

“During the most recent anti-government protests, Iran experienced a complete internet shutdown. Some Iranian traders resorted to international travel in order to close their positions; others logged back into their accounts several days later only to find their positions liquidated; the crackdown will most likely serve as a major deterrent against speculative trading.”

Related: Five Countries Where Crypto Regulation Changed the Most in 2019

Blockchain adoption and cryptocurrency adoption are far from being one and the same, and there are plenty of countries with governments hostile toward cryptocurrency that are more than eager to adopt blockchain technology. Baktas added: “For Iranian investors, Bitcoin is the embodiment of financial independence for an economy that has been teetering on the brink of collapse.”

Iranians cannot invest openly on the NASDAQ or the London Stock Exchange, and investors have relatively few investment opportunities. Bitcoin has the attraction, too, of being a currency “that cannot be taken away--either by the Iranian government or foreign actors. It seems to me they’re just getting started.”

Another option

Before declaring crypto as a leading flight-to-safety option like gold, however, it might be wise to reflect again upon what actually happened in Iran when tensions rose in the past year. The authorities simply shut down the internet, meaning traders couldn’t easily apply their skills.

Programmers compensated for work abroad in BTC didn’t get paid, according to some reports. As Lurya told Cointelegraph, “It appears a decent internet connection is crypto’s newest Achilles heel,” adding:

“I cannot imagine cryptocurrency being more appealing than traditional flight-to-safety assets to anyone at the onset of conflict. If Iran were to experience further political unrest, I would expect Iranian margin traders to rush to abandon their positions in preparation for the likely event of another shutdown.”

Still, it seems clear that those who viewed crypto as a totally uncorrelated asset pre-crisis may have to reassess, given that the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos seemed to rise as world tensions ratcheted up, and subside along with the turmoil — much like gold and silver.","Kraken Futures has hired its first Russian representative in a bid to ramp up its operations in the world’s largest country by land mass.

The regulated futures provider, acquired by Kraken last year when it was called Crypto Facilities, brought on Aleksey Bragin last month and now intends to grow its Russian presence with in-person visits and Russian-language social media groups. The London-based subsidiary currently offers bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin and XRP futures contracts and sees some $48 million in average daily volume for the bitcoin futures. The company saw $17 million in volume on Monday.

“Russia is the most under-appreciated market in crypto today,” said Kevin Beardsley, head of business development at Kraken Futures. Beardsley believes the abundance of tech talent, especially in crypto, makes Russia an attractive market.

“The conversation is dominated by the U.S. and China, probably a bit less Japan and Korea,” he said. “Even [though] Russia is objectively a leader in the infrastructure building and has a large community, it gets relatively little coverage,.”

As two examples, Beardsley cited Telegram and TradingView, which have teams predominantly from Russia and surrounding nations.

Bragin started in November 2019, the company announced last month (Beardsley said the post was published on Dec. 24 but backdated to November). He comes with experience in the industry, having founded peer-to-peer crypto futures exchange ICBIT back in 2011. That was acquired by Swedish crypto exchange Safello in 2016.

“Russian traders increasingly consider cryptocurrency to be just another asset class, alongside commodities and currencies,” Bragin told CoinDesk. “The rapidly growing number of individual traders, combined with the increasing acceptance of trading cryptocurrency, represent clear, positive signals for the growth cryptocurrency futures trading in Russia.”

He added that even though derivatives market at large in Russia is still very young, it’s already “developed into one of the most important markets.”

“Cryptocurrency derivatives started attracting traders from the classic futures market in 2018, it grew in 2019 and trading experts expect the trend to continue in 2020,” Bragin said.

The Russian expansion for Kraken will not involve spot trading or see any fiat on-ramps for the Russian ruble. Crypto-to crypto futures trading is the safest way to enter the market, Beardsley said, as it presents “a relatively low risk of [the exchange being used for] money laundering.”

So far, few global exchanges have paid special attention to Russia, among them Huobi, which opened an office in Moscow in November 2018, Binance, which launched a fiat on-ramp for the Russian ruble earlier this year.

Russians are trading crypto derivatives quite actively, according to the Yakov Barinsky, CEO of HASH CIB, a crypto asset management firm that actively trades derivatives itself.

Barinsky said between 10 percent and 15 percent of the trading volume on the most popular crypto derivatives exchanges like BitMEX, Deribit and Kraken comes from Russian traders, most of whom are professionals.","The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) — the country’s financial regulator — proposed lowering the leverage rate limit of cryptocurrency margin trading from 4x to 2x.

The FSA announced the proposed measure on Jan. 14 in a cabinet office ordinance — an official order that is issued along with a new law.

If enacted, the proposal would be a first for the Japanese government in regulating the rate of crypto margin trading. According to Nikkei, there were previously no rules set by the state.

The FSA reportedly plans to put the order into practice in April when a revised version of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act enters into effect. The FSA is accepting public comments regarding the ordinance until Feb. 13.

Margin trading allows traders to use borrowed funds in order to increase their potential profits, but it is also a high-risk, as it introduces the possibility of losses that exceed a trader's initial investment.

According to Nikkei, the FSA aims to protect investors from “an excessive amount of speculation and the risk of loss due to volatility"".

Some say introducing clear regulations on margin trading is urgent since 80% of crypto trades come from derivatives. Data from the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) — the official self-regulatory organization for the crypto industry in Japan — shows that the volume of leveraged, margin and futures trading for crypto was far higher than that of spot trading in Japan from April 2017 to March 2018.

JVCEA enacted a leverage cap of 4x last year, leading some cryptocurrency exchanges in the country like Coincheck to reduce their rates. However, some economic experts have suggested that the rate should be further lowered to 2x in order to match those in other jurisdictions such as the European Union.",
2020-01-15,"Cryptocurrency derivatives trading struck its highest trading volumes of 2020 on Tuesday, while bitcoin jumped by 9% and ether by 16%, per data compiled by Skew.

For Bitcoin futures contracts, roughly $25 billion traded hands during the single day, making Jan. 14 the busiest session since Oct. 26. Meanwhile, open interest on bitcoin futures was up by 16% to $3.5 billion, with cryptocurrency exchanges OKEx and BitMEX seeing the largest volumes.

The BTC options market also experienced its best day since June 26, with Deribit taking up a lion share of the overall trading volumes while LedgerX and CME led the U.S. market.

A more significant surge was observed in ether, with futures trading volumes hitting $3 billion and tripling the volume from the previous day.

ETH options, on the other hand, jumped to five times the volume of the day before.

The heightened interest in crypto derivatives is likely a combined effect of CME's rollout BTC options trading on Monday and the market becoming more institutionalized, several market observers contended.

""The CME got a decent launch on day one on Monday, and that got a lot of people interested from the traditional market side,"" Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh told The Block.

""For me, it’s a sign that the market gets more mature and sophisticated,"" wrote Deribit COO Marius Jansen in a message to The Block. ""And the price surge: inevitable when more and more players are entering the market, we continue to see more interest from new parties in Bitcoin. Eventually, you can see that in the price action as well.""

2020 will be a busy year for the crypto derivatives market, as both U.S.-focused platforms like CME and Bakkt and offshore exchanges like BitMEX, Deribit, and OKEx compete for market share.

""For now, the U.S. and the offshore markets co-exist. I think the options market may be one of the first products where the regulated offerings are leading... The options market on the offshore side hasn't been as big and as developed as on the futures side,"" said Goh.

Meanwhile, BTC price has been on an upward strike, increasing by 7% over the past 7 days.

Update: An earlier version of this story stated that OKEx and Bitfinex had the largest BTC futures open interest volumes on Jan. 14. It has since been updated to reflect that OKEx and BitMEX had the largest volumes.","The United Nations is warning about the risks of attending North Korea’s cryptocurrency conference in February.

Reuters reports Wednesday that going to the event would probably be a violation of international sanctions, according to a confidential report soon to be put before the U.N. Security Council.

The news comes after ethereum developer Virgil Griffith was arrested and more recently indicted over attending the conference to give a talk last April. Griffith has been charged with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

North Korea has been accused, in another UN report, of funding its weapons of mass destruction program with hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as banking institutions. The August 2019 report said North Korea has used “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” hacks to amass around $2 billion, which is laundered over the internet.

Any effort seen to be enabling the regime’s efforts to circumvent sanctions would likely be illegal under UN rules.

“Supporting the DPRK’s use of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, risks violating the Security Council’s resolutions because it would unavoidably increase the DPRK’s ability to subvert sanctions and generate revenue for its weapons programs,” an anonymous British government spokesman told Reuters.

The website for the North Korean event is reportedly seeking to attract U.S. attendees, saying their passports will not be stamped on entry, helping to obfuscate their visit.","Not the city, the $57 million-funded cryptocurrency custodian startup. When someone wants to keep safe tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin, Ethereum or other coins, they put them in Anchorage’s vault. And now they can trade straight from custody so they never have to worry about getting robbed mid-transaction.

With backing from Visa, Andreessen Horowitz and Blockchain Capital, Anchorage has emerged as the darling of the cryptocurrency security startup scene. Today it’s flexing its muscle and war chest by announcing its first acquisition, crypto risk modeling company Merkle Data.

Anchorage has already integrated Merkle’s technology and team to power today’s launch of its new trading feature. It eliminates the need for big crypto owners to manually move assets in and out of custody to buy or sell, or to set up their own in-house trading. Instead of grabbing some undisclosed spread between the spot price and the price Anchorage quotes its clients, it charges a transparent per transaction fee of a tenth of a percent.

It’s stressful enough trading around digital fortunes. Anchorage gives institutions and token moguls peace of mind throughout the process while letting them stake and vote while their riches are in custody. Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley tells me, “Our clients want to be able to fund a bank account with USD and have it seamlessly converted into crypto, securely held in their custody accounts. Shockingly, that’s not yet the norm — but we’re changing that.”

Buy and sell safely

Founded in 2017 by leaders behind Docker and Square, Anchorage’s core business is its omnimetric security system that takes out of the equation passwords that can be lost or stolen. Instead, it uses humans and AI to review scans of your biometrics, nearby networks and other data for identity confirmation. Then it requires consensus approval for transactions from a set of trusted managers you’ve whitelisted.

With Anchorage Trading, the startup promises efficient order routing, transparent pricing and multi-venue liquidity from OTC desks, exchanges and market makers. “Because trading and custody are directly integrated, we’re able to buy and sell crypto from custody, without having to make risky external transfers or deal with multiple accounts from different providers,” says Bart Stephens, founder and managing partner of Blockchain Capital.

Trading isn’t Anchorage’s primary business, so it doesn’t have to squeeze clients on their transactions, and can instead try to keep them happy for the long-term. That also sets up Anchorage to be a foundational part of the cryptocurrency stack. It wouldn’t disclose the terms of the Merkle Data acquisition, but the Pantera Capital-backed company brings quantitative analysts to Anchorage to keep its trading safe and smart.

“Unlike most traditional financial assets, crypto assets are bearer assets: In order to do anything with them, you need to hold the underlying private keys. This means crypto custodians like Anchorage must play a much larger role than custodians do in traditional finance,” says McCauley. “Services like trading, settlement, posting collateral, lending and all other financial activities surrounding the assets rely on the custodian’s involvement, and in our view are best performed by the custodian directly.”

Anchorage will be competing with Coinbase, which offers integrated custody and institutional brokerage through its agency-only OTC desk. Fidelity Digital Assets combines trading and brokerage, but for Bitcoin only. BitGo offers brokerage from custody through a partnership with Genesis Global Trading. But Anchorage hopes its experience handling huge sums, clear pricing and credentials like membership in Facebook’s Libra Association will win it clients.

McCauley says the biggest threat to Anchorage isn’t competitors, though, but hazy regulation. Anchorage is building a core piece of the blockchain economy’s infrastructure. But for the biggest financial institutions to be comfortable getting involved, lawmakers need to make it clear what’s legal.","Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said Wednesday that it traced $2.8 billion in Bitcoin being sent by criminals to crypto exchanges in 2019, with the bulk of those transactions going to Binance and Huobi.

""While exchanges have always been a popular off-ramp for illicit cryptocurrency, they’ve taken in a steadily growing share since the beginning of 2019. Over the course of the entire year, we traced $2.8 billion in Bitcoin that moved from criminal entities to exchanges,"" Chainalysis noted, with 27.5% of that amount going to Binance and 24.7% going to Huobi.

On the two exchanges, a small group of accounts that received more than $100 billion worth of BTC in 2019 took in most of the illicit funds, Chainalysis found. 75% of the total amount received on Huobi and Binance went to 810 of the highest-receiving accounts.

""Overall, just over 300,000 individual accounts at Binance and Huobi received Bitcoin from criminal sources in 2019,"" Chainalysis noted.

According to the analytics firm, these large accounts likely belong to over-the-counter (OTC) brokers that ""are typically associated with an exchange but operate independently.""

Although Huobi and Binance both have Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures in place, such requirements are lower for OTC desks, hence the existence on the two exchanges of some OTC desks that specialize in providing money-laundering service to criminals, Chainalysis claimed.

In a list of 100 major 100 OTC brokers that Chainalysis believes to provide money laundering services, 70 of them are on Huobi. The 100 brokers together could account for as much as 1% of all Bitcoin activity in a given month, per the report.

The Block has reached out to Huobi and Binance for comments but did not receive responses by press time.

In a statement to Chainalysis, Binance chief compliance officer Samuel Lim said that the exchange ""is committed to cleaning up financial crime in crypto and improving the health of our industry.""

""We will continue to improve on our proprietary KYC and AML technology, as well as the third-party tools and partners we work with, to further strengthen our compliance standards,"" said Lim.","Yesterday, nChain chief scientist and self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator Craig Wright played his final card in his four-year game of either pretending or admitting to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the name on the Bitcoin whitepaper that kicked off the blockchain revolution.

Wright’s attorneys told a judge that they had turned over public addresses from the Tulip Trust—now three trusts—on Jan. 14. Wright has long maintained that Nakamoto’s 1.1 million bitcoins were encrypted with keys that would be returned to him by a “bonded courier” in January 2020.

Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman, the brother of Wright’s late partner Dave Kleiman, for half of that cache, currently valued at about $9.6 billion. Kleiman also wants half of the intellectual property of Bitcoin. (Previous to this, many in the cryptocurrency industry said Kleiman is wasting his time, and others claim that Wright is a fraud.)

The courier’s arrival would likely delay the tumultuous trial in which Wright has been accused of producing forged documents, and two judges have flat out called him a liar. Ira Kleiman’s lawyers said in response on Jan. 14 that Wright gave them 16,404 public bitcoin addresses for the Tulip Trust (or Trusts).

Wright has another gig: evangelist for the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (Bitcoin SV, or BSV) championed by nChain. Wright calls it a return to the “real” Bitcoin created by Satoshi Nakamoto—aka, himself.

In an interview conducted before his Jan. 14 revelation, Modern Consensus talked to Wright about a number of subjects, ranging from his opinion of his detractors’ love lives and why he locked this fortune away to why the Bitcoin blockchain’s genesis block linked to an article in that day’s newspaper—Jan. 3, 2009—about the British Chancellor’s plan to bail out banks.

Editor’s Note: Craig Wright has sat for several interviews with Modern Consensus’ Brendan Sullivan over the years. He gets a lot of hate mail—excuse me, “user engagement”—on the topic.

Sullivan’s opinion on the subject is this: Whether Wright is or isn’t Satoshi Nakamoto, this is still the most interesting story in crypto. A year from now there may not be Ethereum. And who will care who ran that company? But there will likely still be Bitcoin. And we still don’t know who invented it or why. That’s a cool story in itself.

Brendan Jay Sullivan: What do you have to say to your critics?

Craig Wright: Are you creating anything? No. We (at nChain) have new things being built every week, we have patents being filed every week—technology, the updates of the SDK (software development kit), the blockchain being scaled—so who cares?

They can sit there and go, “We think it should be—” So what? There’s a quote from Terry Pratchett that I can’t remember exactly. It’s, “If you wish upon a star and you pray upon the sky and you call out to your fairy or whatever else, then someone who’s been working harder and putting in the effort will beat you and you’ll be left in the dust.” I’m probably misquoting that a bit (laughs).

(Editor’s Note: “If you trust in yourself. . .and believe in your dreams. . .and follow your star. . . you’ll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren’t so lazy.” —Terry Pratchett, “The Wee Free Men.”)

BJS: If you moved the Satoshi blocks today it would shut up a lot of people.

CW: I don’t think it would shut people up. I think it would stir things and what would end up happening is people would be running around saying I stole coins. Or some other bullshit. I disagree.

BJS: I would have questioned you on that. But now that it’s happened to me, I know for a fact that it wouldn’t shut anybody up.

(Editor’s Note: Sullivan scored a phone interview minutes after Wright walked out of a hearing in which a judge declared that he owed Kleiman half of the Satoshi bitcoins and intellectual property before the trial even began. Kleiman’s attorneys then tried—unsuccessfully so far—to subpoena all of Sullivan’s notes and hard drives dating back to 2006. This led to him being trolled harder than usual by Wright’s detractors.)

CW: There’s an agenda. Bitcoin unfortunately inherited the end of e-gold, and then the end of Liberty Reserve currency, both of which were used extensively by criminals. They had some legitimate things, but 99% of those people ended up being criminals. And all of those people flushed into Bitcoin, (because they) thought Bitcoin was going to be anonymous. Which it isn’t. And they thought they could get away with things.

Idiots in Silk Road (the now-shuttered dark web drugs and guns site) are discovering (this) as they try and move (bit)coins. That ain’t happening. Bit by bit all these things are causing problems for them. Hey, should have realized there’s an immutable evidence trail.

Unfortunately, at the time, we had to inherit all the idiots who came over. Everyone saying Bitcoin was “anti-bank.” But am I a time-traveler? Think about it, if it started in 2007, that whole global financial crisis hadn’t happened yet! I don’t know why that’s hard to explain to people! Yeah, I created bitcoin because I knew the whole global financial crisis was going to happen. And I would be there—ready for the Occupy people who’d be grabbing bitcoin and twisting it to suit their needs.

BJS: Do they extrapolate all of this because you linked to that one Times of London article about the recession? About the Central banks? (“Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks”) Does everybody get that one wrong?

CW: No one reads anything. Everyone sits there and reads the headline. That article was about the fact that U.K. Chancellor Alastair Darling was threatening to nationalize the banks, in the same way that had happened just after WWII, 1946-48. Then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came and removed all the nationalization and handed it back to private control, and then you’ve got this complete wanker, threatening to nationalize everything and turn it socialist again. Because of their own problems that they caused.

(Author’s Note: In Andrew O’Hagan’s London Review of Books article about Wright, he gave this reason: “As you know, I am rather anti-central/reserve bank,’ he wrote to me. ‘I see them as the true cause of these issues and the bubbles and collapses. But the date was important as a timestamp. It means that I could not have been “pre-mining” and gaming the system. The first iteration of the code was finalised on 9 January 2009. The run was started when I was at the farm in Macquarie (Australia) later that week. It means that I cannot have been mining for months ahead and had collected a pre-mined set of solved hashes to game the system. I ran more than 50 machines, so the headline was a marker.”)

BJS: Interesting. Everyone takes that headline to make you anti-government.

CW: I mean, if you read the article you’ll see what it’s about! It was basically telling the banks, “I’m going to make you give out more home loans because politically, the price of houses falling is not good for us politicians.” I know that you can’t give away home loans because the interest rate’s just about zero, but I don’t care what you want: Lose money or we’re going to nationalize you. This doesn’t make the banks the bad guys, it makes it that freaking (obscenity that goes a bit too far for non-Australians).

BJS: When Silk Road blew up in 2011, the exchange price of bitcoin was about a dollar. It just happened to be one of those perfect-storm things where a bunch of idiots said “I can’t send money through PayPal, but this bitcoin thing is worth a dollar, let me send it that way.”

CW: Yep.

BJS: Did that make you not want to be a part of this universe anymore?

CW: I could have accepted something like a Canadian weed store, anything like that, but this whole idea of a heroin store coming in July/August 2010 as a concept. And people ranting about it, saying “Yay, this is going to take down the government!”

What a stupid thing to do! “We can send heroin and things through the post!” and then they start with this “Haha, we can start sending guns and weapons and explosives through the post!”

What if people want to commit suicide? “Then we should be able to have a market where we do it for them.”

What fucking morons! I mean, honestly. I wonder if these people drink Drano and kill their brain cells intentionally.

BJS: That’s one of the most annoying things about this crypto world, is it’s just full of a bunch of lame idiots. I hate to say it.

CW: Yep. “You can’t be Satoshi, because you got a degree and we want to drop out. How dare you be a coder if you didn’t work as a coder, you just worked as a university lecturer?” Oh no, how evil.

BJS: My first book is about being a DJ so all these idiots who come out of the woodwork are like, “You’re not a real journalist, you’re just a DJ-turned-blogger,” and I’m like “I know! I’ve also had a girlfriend before, dork!”

CW: (Laughs) I’m sure most of them haven’t.

BJS: What am I missing?

CW: The reality of how courts and everything work. If you want to look at these things, follow the money and follow who benefits. Who benefits if there’s a partnership? Why would someone create a fake partnership document? (This is referring to the document between Wright and Dave Kleiman, which is the grounds for the lawsuit.—Ed.)

BJS: That’s your argument, that there’s no partnership. Or that it’s run out.

CW: There wasn’t one. Not in the legal, technical sense. I form companies. The question is always: Follow the money and see who benefits.

BJS: It would be a cool story if a courier shows up with new information.

CW: (Long pause) Um-hum.

BJS: Is that a likely cool story that I’ll get to write about? And get a huge book advance?

CW: (laughs) I do not know whether you will get a book advance.

BJS: Right. Well. I heard an answer to part of the question. Anything you’d like to add?

CW: Nope. I still don’t know whether you’d get a book advance or what writing Satoshi stories will get you these days. But there are so many trash books out there these days you probably would get one.

BJS: Do you think this is a story that will have an ending or do you think it’ll just be the story until the trolls move onto something else?

CW: Stories have endings and don’t. I’m not going away. Eventually I’ll die. But that hopefully is 40 or 50 years from now. So the reality here is I’m still going to be inventing, still going to be creating. As much as people throw at me, I’m not going to stop. Eventually they’ll wear down and get used to the fact that I have not given up. I’m not going to go away.

I’ll still be inventing and creating new things, and they’ll be looking back going “Oh bugger, this guy’s got most of the intellectual property in this field tied up” and doing their little anarchist rants and saying “It’s evil, he shouldn’t have the things he invented. He should give them away for free, because I didn’t work and I want to have things without working. He’s got more drive and discipline than me so therefore he has a benefit I don’t have so I should be able to take his shit.”

BJS: That is where our tech utopia world has taken us.

CW: Technosocialism! (laughs)","David Gray/Reuters

Bitcoin is up about 22% in the first 15 days of the new year, notching its best start-of-year surge since 2012, The Wall Street Journal first reported.

The digital currency is nearing the $9,000 threshold just two weeks into 2020, and crypto-enthusiasts expect institutional interest to drive prices higher through the year.

Other cryptocurrencies have soared through the year-to-date, with Ethereum and Ripple up 29% and 23%, respectively.

Watch bitcoin trade live here.

Bitcoin is already up more than 20% year-to-date, boasting its best start-of-year streak since 2012.

The digital currency is nearing the $9,000-per-coin threshold 15 days into 2020 as investors and crypto-enthusiasts project increased use of the tech in the new year.

The Wall Street Journal first reported bitcoin's 15-day performance.

Other cryptocurrencies have also surged through the last two weeks. Ethereum is up nearly 29% year-to-date, and Ripple has gained about 23% in the same period.

Numerous factors are fueling bitcoin bulls' hopes. Global markets company CME Group launched options tied to bitcoin futures this week, establishing a new vehicle for institutional investors to buy in to the crypto coin.

""I think you're going to see greater mainstream adoption,"" Michael Conn, a managing partner at Quail Creek Ventures, told The Journal. ""You can see this happening already with Fidelity and other institutional players moving into the space.""

Some investing giants are already calling for the currency to soar through 2020. Jeffrey Gundlach - CEO and chief investment officer of DoubleLine Capital - recommended investors pile into bitcoin in 2019 before its 95% surge through the year. He recently repeated his optimism for the currency, and even thinks the coin could nearly double its value by year-end.

""I think bitcoin's going to go higher in the near term. I think it could go as high as $15,000 in 2020,"" Gundlach said in a January 7 webcast.

Bitcoin investors are also betting on the currency's ""halving"" to prop up prices. The event is set to occur on May 12 and cut the amount of bitcoin awarded for blockchain mining in half. Demand for the currency will likely remain stable, but the drop in coin reward to 6.25 bitcoin from 12.5 can fuel higher prices for the digital asset.

The new-year rally follows a tumultuous year for the world's biggest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin nearly broke through $14,000 in the summer as hopes for Facebook's libra coin peaked, but fell through the second half of 2019 amid fading enthusiasm around the project and heightened regulatory fears.

Bitcoin traded at $8,756.49 per coin as of 10:50 a.m. ET Wednesday.

Bitcoin violated crucial resistance near $8,460 on Tuesday, strengthening the case for a rise to the 200-day average at $9,100.

The pullback seen in the last 12 hours or so lacks volume support and could be short-lived.

Acceptance under Tuesday's low of $8,100 would abort the short-term bullish bias. Indicators, however, are reporting strong bullish momentum, so a drop below $8,100 looks unlikely.

Bitcoin jumped sharply on Tuesday, violating key resistance and opening the doors for a test of a widely followed technical line above $9,000.

The number one cryptocurrency by market value added nearly $800 to its price and ended the day (UTC) with 8.74 percent gains – the biggest single-day gain since Dec. 15, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Back then, bitcoin had reversed higher from an eight-month low of $6,425 to score its first double-digit gain since Oct. 25. The big move from multi-month lows warned of an impending reversal of the six-month bearish period – a trend change that was confirmed with last week’s 11 percent price gain.

That bullish breakout has been bolstered by Tuesday’s move above $8,463 – passing the resistance of a lower high created on Jan. 8.

As a result, the next major resistance – the 200-day moving average (MA) located at $9,100 – could soon come into play.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $8,710, representing a 1.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.

While prices have pulled back from Tuesday’s high of $8,900, the technical charts suggest it’s nothing more than a temporary correction.

Daily chart

Bitcoin rose more than 8 percent and closed well above $8,463 on Tuesday. The breakout above the lower high was accompanied by the strongest buying volumes (green bar) since Nov. 25, according to Bitstamp data.

Volumes also rose sharply on major exchanges including Bitfinex and Coinbase, which are included in the calculation of Bitwise’s “real 10” bitcoin trading volume listing along with Bitstamp.

As a result, further gains could be in the offing, more so as there are no signs of overbought conditions. The 14-day relative strength index is yet to cross into overbought territory above 70.00.

Further, bullish momentum is looking strong with the five- and 10-day averages sloping upwards.

Hourly chart

In the six hours to 05:00 UTC, trading volumes dipped as the cryptocurrency pulled back from $8,900 to $8,555. A low-volume price drop is often short-lived.

The RSI has also realigned in favor of the bulls as opposed to above-70 readings seen 24 hours ago.

All in all, bitcoin looks set to pass the psychological resistance of $9,000 and test the 200-day MA at $9,100 in the short-term.

A UTC close above the

200-day MA would expose key resistances located at $9,400 and $10,350.

Popular analyst Josh Rager expects a potential break above $10,350 to set the tone for a major bull run for months to come.

The cryptocurrency reversed sharply lower from $10,350 in October, so a move past that resistance could attract keener buying.

The short-term bullish view would be invalidated if prices find acceptance under Tuesday’s low of $8,105. That level could come into play if the cryptocurrency breaches the former hurdle-turned-support of $8,463 on the back of strong volumes.","The cryptocurrency industry is unfortunately rife with scams and hackers looking to steal your hard-earned crypto coins.

A variety of tactics are used by hackers and their methods are improving every day.

The most common strategies adopted by scammers include financial pyramid schemes, exchanges targeting exit scams, fake web and hardware wallets, and even Ponzi schemes.

In order to better understand how hackers successfully steal your cryptocurrency, I will take an in-depth look at each method using real-life examples.

Hopefully, by understanding how hackers operate and what red flags to look out for, you’ll be better prepared to fend them off and successfully protect your coins.

In this article, I’ll discuss Ponzi schemes, financial pyramid schemes, and fake web and hardware wallets.

Ponzi schemes

According to Investopedia, Ponzi schemes (or scams) are based on fraudulent investment management services.

Investors typically contribute money to the “portfolio manager” who promises them a high return. Afterwards, when those investors want their money back, they are paid out with the incoming funds contributed by later investors.

The person organising this type of fraud is in charge of controlling the entire operation – they merely transfer funds from one client to another and forgo any real investment activities.

One of the biggest Ponzi schemes in crypto – one that currently keeps adding selling pressure to Bitcoin – is the Plus Token scam.

“Plus Token” was a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme disguised as a high-yield investment program. Platform administrators closed down the operation in June 2019 after withdrawing over $3 billion in stolen cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EOS.

A report by Chainalysis, a US-based blockchain analysis company, claims Plus Token was “one of the largest Ponzi schemes ever” and was potentially responsible for the 2019 downturn in BTC price.

The report claims that there are still at least 20,000 BTC and 790,000 ETH missing which could be dumped on the market at any time.

Financial pyramid schemes

A financial pyramid scheme is structured so that the initial schemer must recruit other investors who will continue to recruit other investors, and those investors will then continue to recruit additional investors, and so on.

There will be an incentive that is presented as an investment opportunity, such as the right to sell a particular product or high earnings per recruit.

Each investor pays the person who recruited them and so on. The recipient must share the proceeds with those in the higher levels of the pyramid structure.

One key difference is that pyramid schemes are harder to prove than Ponzi schemes. They are also better protected because the legal teams behind corporations are much more powerful than those protecting an individual.

Just recently in Brazil, a group called “Bitcoin Banco” (Bitcoin Bank) is alleged to have conducted a million dollar exit scam.

The group was in charge of a great deal of exchanges in the country and promised set returns to investors who traded the exchange currency, Negociecoins.

However, according to analysts, “This profit did not exist because the company needs investor money to produce order book orders.”

Fake wallets

One of the most common mistakes by junior cryptocurrency users is to fall prey to fake cryptocurrency web wallets and hardware wallets.

Since some users trust Google and other search engines to look up websites, it’s quite easy to click on the wrong website.

To avoid making this mistake, always check the website you’re accessing is the real one.

There are loads of fake URLs and GitHub repositories with the sole purpose of stealing your precious cryptocurrency.

A simple solution is to save websites you visit often, like web wallets and exchanges, into your browser favourites list.

That way, it will be near impossible to fall prey to fake URL hacks.

Conclusion

Before making any decisions about trading your cryptocurrency or investing in a new coin, make sure you complete thorough research. Keep on top of the latest news and trends as reports of scams begin to increase.

Most of all, don’t forget to apply everyday digital best practices to your activity. Cryptocurrency scams and vulnerabilities will continue to evolve as the industry grows and it’s your responsibility to stay protected.

2020-01-16,"Rewards received by bitcoin miners form a major chunk of the salaries paid across major proof of work (PoW) blockchains, according to Yassine Elmandjra, a cryptocurrency analyst from ARK Invest.

For example, bitcoin miners were paid over $15 million worth of the cryptocurrency as incentive to mine blocks and secure the network on Jan. 9. Meanwhile, the total rewards paid across bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and other major PoW cryptocurrencies including zcash (ZEC), litecoin (LTC), ethereum classic (ETC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) were just a bit more than $18 million.

Essentially, bitcoin miners were responsible for nearly 83 percent of the total mining rewards paid across major PoW blockchains.

Since mid-2017, bitcoin miners’ salary share has increased by 250 percent, while that of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has dropped significantly.

Proof-of-work is a consensus algorithm for blockchain networks where miners find blocks by solving cryptographically hard puzzles. This is in contrast to the proof-of-stake (PoS), where validators lock up the respective cryptocurrency to claim their stake in the ecosystem.

Strongest coin

The fact that bitcoin miners are drawing significantly higher salaries than their counterparts is not surprising, given bitcoin is the strongest PoW-powered coin with the largest network effect and the longest track record, according to Muneeb Ali, CEO of Blockstack PBC.

A network effect is the idea that as adoption and integration into a system grows, so does its value – and at an exponential rate rather than at a linear rate.

Back in 2016, bitcoin expert Trace Mayer mentioned the store of value appeal, security and speculation that bitcoin’s network effect would grow rapidly.

“The cryptocurrency has almost totally captured the store of value narrative, allowing for consolidation around the strongest coin,” Blockstack’s Ali said.

Further, bitcoin’s network security, as represented by its hash rate, has increased sharply over the years, helping build confidence in the blockchain and establishing a positive feedback loop of security and network effect. At press time, bitcoin’s hash rate is roughly 100,000,000 Terahashes (or 100 exahashes).

Looking forward

Bitcoin’s share of PoW mining could grow even larger in the future as ethereum and other blockchains begin shifting to proof-of-stake, which is less energy-intensive consensus mechanism, said Ali.

Ethereum is expected to complete the transition from PoW to PoS by 2022. “Its network will be better once ETH 2.0 (post-transition) shows its true value in the global market,” Steve Tsou, Global CEO of RRMine, told CoinDesk.

Another factor that could affect miner’s income and influence bitcoin’s share of PoW mining is the reward halving due in four months. The rewards received for per block mined on bitcoin’s blockchain will be reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC sometime in May. Mining costs will double post halving and that could crowd out weak miners, causing changes between supply and demand.

RRMine’s Tsou said miners’ income will rise if halving creates a supply deficit, pushing prices above mining costs. That could also boost bitcoin’s share of PoW mining – more so, as increased profitability may attract miners from other chains.

“The most important thing is that the miners control the cost, which completely determines if the miners can profit from it,” Tsou said.","Have you ever wondered how you can earn bitcoin passively in the modern crypto age? Well look no further, here is the perfect guide to help you get started.



Bitcoin has generated massive returns since it began publicly trading in 2010. BTC has had its bearish periods but the overall trend has remained very bullish. The graph below shows the market cap of Bitcoin from 2014 to date.



It is clearly evident that Bitcoin has garnered much prominence as an investable asset. This can be seen from the various BTC- institutional-grade offerings designed by key industry players like Bakkt and Fidelity, to involve Wall Street market participants.

BTC has gone through quite some market cycles to achieve the market valuation it currently possesses. Hence, it may not be financially viable for a lot of traders to buy large amounts of Bitcoin. Even buying fractions of BTC would require shelling out of generous amounts of cash.

In light of this, here is a list of alternative ways to generate passive income through earning free BTC just before the 3rd Bitcoin Halving in May 2020.

Work for Bitcoin Earn Satoshis & accumulate BTC Shop & Earn BTC cashback Affiliate Programs

Working For Bitcoin

Working in exchange for BTC is the easiest and most legitimate way of earning bitcoin.

Whether you are a developer, designer, writer, translator, editor, internet marketer, freelancer or engineer, you can start working for Bitcoin right now.

There are numerous platforms and websites that offer you bitcoin in exchange for your service.

Some of these platforms include:

Earn Satoshis and Accumulate Bitcoin

Each bitcoin (BTC) is divisible up to8 decimal places, so each BTC can be split into 100,000,000 units. Each unit of bitcoin, or 0.00000001 BTC, is called a satoshi. A satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin.

One of the ways to earn bitcoin is to accumulate large amounts of Satoshis through trading altcoins/ all cryptocurrencies except BTC, and then convert them to bitcoin.

Every trading pair is formed as ALTxBTC, not ALTxUSD

When you’re buying and selling an altcoin in sats (Satoshis), if you sell when it’s up in USD but not sats, you end up inadvertently trading away your bitcoin. You must learn to trade relative to bitcoin, as accumulating satoshis is the only way to win this game. The key is to value bitcoin individually and not relative to USD.

Example

Start: 100k sats is worth $5. Altcoin is worth 100k sats. You buy 1 altcoin at 100k sats.

Scenario 1: 100k sats are now worth $4. Altcoin is now worth 100k sats.

Scenario 2: 100k sats is now worth $6. Altcoin is now worth 100k sats.

Scenario 3: 100k sats is now worth $5. Altcoin is now worth 120k sats.



With #1, Altcoin is down 20% in USD but you’ve stayed the same in satoshi value. Which means you have the same value as Bitcoin. Which is good!

With #2, you’re up 20% in USD but not Satoshi. Which means you have the same value as Bitcoin. Which is again good!

With #3, you’re up 20% in satoshi, but the same in USD. Which is better!



Since the value of BTC is higher than USD, always trade in Bitcoin or Satoshi and you reap more profits.

This example highlights the issues in valuing crypto assets in USD. #3, you’d realize your Satoshi gains by converting to BTC. #1& #2 there are no conversions to be made as your sats are the same, but #2, people trading USD value may make a trade, and see a gain in USD but with Bitcoin value, they have neither booked a profit nor a loss. To people trading, USD value for #2 & #3 are actually the same, even though the alt is going from $5 to $6 in USD.

The difference is that in #3 the alt is outpacing BTC growth, which is the outcome we are looking for while in #2 it’s just pacing the same as BTC. #2 is not a trade to be made.#3 is the only trade to be made.

Shop and Earn BTC Cashbacks

Ebates, a popular Google Chrome Extension, offers customers cash-back for their purchases from thousands of websites. They work with almost all major online retailers, including everything from Best Buy to Groupon, to Nike. Once you install the extension and create an account, Ebates will notify you if there are discounts available while you browse a retailer’s website. In one click you can activate the discounts. At the end of every quarter, you get a check from Ebates with your cashback balance. It’s that simple.

In crypto, a company called Lolli is offering similar services. Make purchases on websites like Sephora, Macy’s, CVS or any of the 500+ partner stores, and get cash-back in Bitcoin. Every store has a different incentive amount. Some offer as much as 9% cash-back. Others will offer a set amount of BTC. This is a very easy way to earn free Bitcoin while making your everyday purchases.

Other similar apps are:

Foldapp (Supports Airbnb)

Pei

Cryptocom (Offers a Crypto debit card with cash back features)

Affiliate Programs

Images via Shutterstock, chart by Coinmarketcap","Criminals appear to be laundering an increasing amount of cryptocurrency by moving it to reputable exchanges, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.

The news: Chainalysis, which uses data analysis to trace cryptocurrency transactions and characterize users, says that in 2019 criminal entities moved $2.8 billion in Bitcoin to exchanges, up from around $1 billion in 2018. More than half of that went to the two most popular ones, Binance and Huobi, it says.

Wait, what’s going on? Criminals have to convert cryptocurrency they have acquired illegally into cash. The popular exchanges are subject to anti-money-laundering rules that require them to know who their customers are. But Chainalysis’s researchers think criminals have found a workaround: third-party “over the counter” (OTC) brokers. These brokers facilitate trades between buyers and sellers who have chosen to avoid transacting via a regulated exchange. “The problem, however, is that while most OTC brokers run a legitimate business, some of them specialize in providing money laundering services for criminals,” according to Chainalysis.

The “Rogue 100”: According to the new analysis, only a small subset of OTC brokers are facilitating most of this criminal activity. Chainalysis has compiled a list of 100 that appear to provide money-laundering services, which it has dubbed the “Rogue 100.” The list’s members are “extremely active traders” who have been receiving steadily increasing amounts of cryptocurrency each month since 2017, according to Chainalysis, which says the activity of these traders “skyrocketed” this year.

What is the solution? Exchanges should be stricter in scrutinizing OTC desks, says Chainalysis. Conveniently for the company, this process may include the greater use of analytics tools like those it has developed. Cracking down on rogue OTC brokers could have broad effects, the company says: “After all, if there were no way for bad actors to cash out … there’d be far less incentive for them to commit crimes in the first place.”

It could be an eventful year for trend-based investing.

A cryptocurrency mining computer equipped with four cooling fans is seen on display at a computer mall in Hong Kong, January 29, 2018.

Bitcoin bulls probably have a bit more waiting to do.

A bitcoin ETF from Bitwise Asset Management came closer than it ever had to being approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in October of last year, according to Matt Hougan, Bitwise's head of research, only to be rejected again for concerns around potential fraud and manipulation.

The latest hiccup in issuers' yearslong battle for a bitcoin-based ETF has put a slight hold on cryptocurrencies' entrance into the exchange-traded fund space. Bitwise's top management wrote in a letter to the SEC in December that the firm remained ""committed"" to bringing a bitcoin ETF to market that addressed regulators' concerns.

For Lydon, the whole process has been a bit like the movie ""Groundhog Day,"" he said in a Monday interview with CNBC's ""ETF Edge.""

But ""a couple good things ... have happened,"" Lydon said. ""First of all, the SEC approved the first '40-Act-approved ETF.""

Lydon, who put 60% odds on a bitcoin ETF receiving full SEC approval in 2020, was referring to the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates companies that invest or trade securities and sell their own shares to investors. The NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund from Stone Ridge Trust was the first bitcoin-based fund to receive approval via the '40 Act, though, as Lydon noted Monday, it has a $25 million limit on its assets.

""Like a regular mutual fund, like the Magellan Fund, there's a sister mutual fund out there where you can invest in bitcoin,"" Lydon said of the NYDIG product. ""The more [that bitcoin-based products] can get on public … account statements like your Schwab account, like your TD account, that's going to help things out.""

With the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launching options on bitcoin futures Monday, that could help the digital currency's chances, Lydon added.

DeFi protocols are proving their value after providing profit-making opportunities during diverse market conditions.

Building Financial Utility

In the first half of 2019, as the cryptocurrency market started to rise from multi-year lows, DeFi got its first taste of a bull market as loans on Maker hit an all-time high of $505 million.

Just like one can make money any time of year in the traditional markets, DeFi has provided people with yield through challenging market conditions.

Prior to the boom in lending and interest-bearing crypto assets, red markets revealed few opportunities for profit-taking. That is until non-custodial money markets entered the picture. The launch of Compound v2 in May 2019 was a game-changer for DeFi as a whole.

Once implications of a crypto-native money market were realized, assets locked in Compound grew from $25 million to over $100 million. For its part, dYdX also capitalized on this opportunity, growing from $140,000 to $31 million in value over seven months.

Automated investment strategies, such as Set Protocol, are a way for investors to take advantage of prolonged bear markets by accumulating more assets with the potential to appreciate. Launched in April 2019, Set Protocol has grown to nearly $3 million in assets under management in under a year.

Anybody can invest in a strategy that automatically rebalances between ETH and USDC, depending on conditions set by market indicators, such as the 21-day moving average crossover.

Set’s strategies work best during times of downfall as the protocol accrues more ETH as prices drop.

When an ETH bull market arrives, Set Protocol investors have a major edge over those who have just held ETH. This is because of their dynamic strategy of hoarding stablecoins as markets fall and pushing the capital back into ETH as markets take off.

Protocols Through Rallies and Troughs

From Jan. 10 to Jan. 15, ETH rose roughly 21% against the dollar. Over this same period, value locked in DeFi went from $650 million to $796 million.

Incoming data from the past few days also indicates a strong correlation between the price of ETH and sentiment around DeFi applications.

First, consider the behavior of one of crypto’s most prominent demographics. In prolonged bull markets, speculators typically use their ETH as collateral to take loans and hoard more ETH.

When the spot price of ETH trended during Dec. 2018 to June 2019, speculators used their ETH to borrow DAI and either hold it or sell it for more ETH. In this situation, there is a lower risk of such a loan being liquidated due to the collateral losing value.

In the last three days, there have been 6,983 DAI trades across 1225 traders and 5 DEXes.

The average size of each trade was 9.89 ETH. At 6,983 trades, that’s a three-day DEX volume of 69,053 ETH. Maker also enjoyed an uptick after jumping from $391 million of collateral locked to $457 million over the same period of time.

Almost 52% of that trade volume came from OasisDEX, Maker’s own DEX, which recently reopened and has been integrated into the platform.

This further supports the narrative that the uptick in DeFi usage during this period came from speculators using Maker to enter leveraged spot long positions.

By posting ETH as collateral and buying ETH with that loan, speculators use their ETH holdings to buy even more ETH. There are similar trends in the broader DeFi ecosystem that show investor’s appetite for risk has moved toward collateralized leverage.

Additionally, Synthetix, a protocol with a similar value proposition to Maker, saw its value locked rise from $108 million to $145 million within the last three days. With Synthetix, users can hold the native token, SNX, to collateralize with an inherent leverage of 1.13x thanks to its 750% collateralization.

One of the synthetic assets on the protocol is sETH (synthetic ETH), which recreates the investment effect of ETH by introducing a one-to-one peg. This is another means of capturing capital appreciation from ETH.

In sum, bear markets create demand for stablecoins while money markets become lender-oriented as the search for yield ramps up. In bull markets, speculators leverage their positions through spot trading or derivative platforms like dYdX.

DeFi’s Resilience

This entire episode stands as a testament to DeFi’s ability to thrive in a variety of circumstances. Bull markets tend to create exuberant sentiment within the market, leading to greater growth. But for investors with an appetite for risk during corrections, there are still opportunities.

This week’s edition of Our Network, a newsletter curated by Spencer Noon, sheds more light on how DeFi protocols managed to turn a bear market into an opportunity.

Alex Kroeger, a data scientist for 0x, revealed in the newsletter that slippage on the platform was minimized as the market turned downward. Typically, market downturns are accompanied by a reduction in liquidity and an increase in slippage, so this is a rather unexpected finding.

In the same report, Kyber Network’s Deniz Omer indicated that Kyber went from $70 million in volume in 2018 to $380 million in 2019. One would expect the major chunk of this to come in Q1 and Q2, when sentiment was soaring. However, 64% of that volume came in Q3 and Q4, showing robust growth even during a bear market.

Kyber even managed to grow in terms of the absolute number of trades executed, which shows diverse activity rather than just a few massive orders placed by individual whales.

What This Means for DeFi

DeFi has been undeniably sustainable during the span of the last two years since Maker kicked off the movement by launching DAI. There is still a lot that can be done, however, to make dApps more accessible to the general public.

For example, the majority of developers are involved in mobile interfaces, but most dApps need a browser wallet to give users the ability to transact. Argent, one of many mobile wallets built on Ethereum, is being touted to bridge the gap between regular users and the complex world of crypto.

Protocol growth is moving in the right direction by focusing on the development of sustainable risk-taking opportunities, but the gargantuan task of actually bringing this utility to the masses remains a marked challenge.","One of the world’s most famous cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, will no longer be serving cryptocurrency speculators in Japan.

Binance made the announcement on its Japanese language page.

The announcement, according to an automated translation, reads:

“Thank you for always patronizing Binance. Binance.com will be phasing out the provision of services to residents of Japan. Therefore, in the future, we plan to gradually restrict transactions for Japanese residents. As soon as the details of the transaction restrictions are determined, we will contact you shortly. At this stage, there are no restrictions on trading, and all services are available as usual. If you have any questions or comments, please contact our customer support… We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to residents of Japan, and we ask for your understanding and cooperation.”

According to Bloomberg, Binance was issued a warning in March 2018 by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) after the agency found that the platform was facilitating cryptocurrency trades by residents of Japan without holding the proper license.

Bloomberg also reported that Binance was one of seven exchanges to receive a warning letter from regulators in Hong Kong advising them to make sure they were not facilitating trades of cryptocurrencies and tokens classed as securities under Hong Kong law.

Binance was founded in China and reportedly moved to Japan just prior to China’s 2017 extension of a crypto ban program initiated in early 2016.

Binance reportedly vacated its Japan offices and relocated to Malta around the same time it was warned by the Japanese FSA.

In September 2018, a representative of the FSA claimed that 160 applicants were seeking licenses to set up crypto trading platforms in Japan.

The business may have been attracted to the region because of Japan’s adjacency to China, where cryptocurrency speculation and use persisted considerably despite official sanction.

At around the same time as many were trying to enter, 13 crypto companies, including Kraken, were leaving Japan.

Kraken CEO Jesse Powell is an outspoken critic of red tape in finance regulation.

When Kraken left Japan, it said that a required preoccupation with regulatory obligations had negatively impacted profitability at its Japan operation.","Nazis are raising millions in Bitcoin – and a crypto comic by an alleged Nazi has sparked a heated debate on the r/Bitcoin subreddit.

The US House Financial Services committee closely examined the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during its hearing into domestic terror financing this week.

Congressional Research Service finance expert Rena Miller and Anti-Defamation League Senior Vice President George Selim both said that white supremacists are among the most enthusiastic about Bitcoin.

Selim said that notorious neo-Nazi troll Andrew ‘weev’ Auernheimer has received large amounts of donated Bitcoin, as have neo-Nazis sites and publications like Stormfront and The Daily Stormer.

Congressman Brad Sherman of California said that Andrew Anglin, publisher of the neo Nazi publication The Daily Stormer received $60,000 in Bitcoin following the attack in Charlottesville.

Nazis love PayPal and iTunes too

Crypto is of course, far from the only way domestic terror groups raise funds.

The hearings also heard that at least 69 domestic terror groups have been using PayPal to collect money, the KKK’s David Duke had his own YouTube channel, and at least 54 white power bands are flogging songs on iTunes and

The Southern Poverty Law Centre has persuaded PayPal and Google to cut off funding to hate groups – but this will only make it more likely they will embrace cryptocurrency.

The SPLC maintains a page devoted to identified Bitcoin wallets that help fund neo Nazis.

A quick glance over wallets the SPLC say belong to the Daily Stormer show they have received at least 215 Bitcoin, or around $1.87 million worth. (Here’s just one of their wallets).

Why do Nazi’s love Bitcoin?

As discussed, Bitcoin is a very practical way for Nazis to get around being kicked off mainstream payment processors .

But Bitcoin’s libertarian ethos has also long attracted members of the alt-right, many of who congregate in the badlands of 4chan/biz.

The Christchurch shooter claimed in his 8chan manifesto that he’d financed his travels around the world (where he self radicalised) through cryptocurrency investments.

Even Reddit’s crypto forums aren’t immune. This week a comic by alleged Nazi sympathiser Stonetoss was posted on the r/Bitcoin subreddit.

The posted content itself was fairly innocuous about the ‘Bitcoin bubble’ comic but it sparked a heated debate because some users felt that it was providing a platform for Stonetoss and would draw cryptocurrency fans towards his other material which is frequently described as altright and white supremacist.

“Yo, Stonetoss is an actual Nazi,” wrote JingleJangleJin

Others said Nazi content was a concern, but a Bitcoin related comic was fine.

But Axel-Adams argued: “Supporting the comic provides income to someone who is a literal self proclaimed nazi and white supremisist. Enabling them to further promote their non bitcoin related views, that’s why it’s wrong.

The mod wasn’t a fan of the debate and stickied a comment saying: “If you have something political to say take it to another subreddit.

User aescolanus did just that on Buttcoin, writing: “r/Bitcoin posts pro-Bitcoin content created by neo-Nazi. Again. Comments argue over whether it’s ok to post pro-Bitcoin content created by neo-Nazi. Again. “Why do neo-Nazis love Bitcoin so much” goes undiscussed. Again.

Buttoiners also had a lively debate between free speech advocates and those opposed to giving a platform to Stonetoss.

[Note that while StoneToss claims: ‘No I am not a member of the National Socialist German Worker’s Party, a national socialist or a fascist’, RationalWiki reckons he is.

And he doesn’t seem to mind being called one:",

Bitcoin has all but erased the day's gains after pushing past the $9,000 resistance level this morning.

A significant move back above $9,000 could trigger liquidations and a possible short squeeze across the market.

Other cryptocurrencies continue to recoup losses from late 2019.

Bitcoin’s bulls have failed to make a solid move above $9,000, having briefly topped the level earlier on Friday.

After an indecisive Thursday, prices started their rise during the Asian trading day. Based on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the top cryptocurrency by market cap moved from just under $8,700 at 01:00 UTC to $9,009 around 10:00 UTC – the third attempt to break through this morning.

At press time, prices had dropped back to $8,841 – a gain of 1.05 percent over 24 hours.

“$9,000 would be a test as it is seen as a key resistance level, both from a technical and psychological point of view,” wrote Simon Peters, eToro analyst and crypto expert, in a note Friday. “Such an increase would also see the price challenge the current 200-day moving average, a strong indication that bitcoin is entering into bullish territory.”

He added: “However, there is always the risk of retracement if the community thinks bitcoin is overbought.”

The recent rally has not just bitcoin-only movement. Most other cryptocurrencies have also experienced strong gains in the past 24 hours. Coins in the top 10, including ether, XRP and Binance coin, are also coming close to two-month highs.

There are also some outliers. Following the launch of Binance futures Thursday, ethereum classic is now trading at just below $10, the highest since October 2018.

This strong surge in alternative cryptocurrencies has had a slight effect on the broader dynamics of the asset class. Bitcoin dominance – the coin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market – has dropped from nearly 2 percent since last Friday.

Bitcoin currently makes up approximately 66 percent of the total market, according to CoinMarketCap. Declining dominance suggests traders are placing proportionally less value into bitcoin, attracted to the possibility of making better returns from bets outside of the original cryptocurrency.

Should the bulls be able to push bitcoin firmly back above the $9,000 threshold, the market may face a short squeeze – a sharp rise in a particular asset’s price following a series of mass liquidations.

There’s some precedent for this. In the space of a few days at the beginning of April last year, bitcoin increased by more than $1,000 after finally moving past the long-fought-over $4,200 resistance line.

Data collected by crypto analytics site Skew show that the April move caused more than $500 million worth of short liquidations on BitMEX (see chart below). According to CoinGecko, BitMEX’s BTC/USD derivatives volumes have increased over the past seven days. Daily volumes were approaching $3.5 billion at press time, more than a billion dollars higher than last Friday.

Data for January 2019 – January 2020

Helped along by the hype surrounding Facebook’s Libra coin, the April move triggered a bull run that ultimately took bitcoin up to $13,000 by the end of June 2019. Looking at prices today, it’s possible that should a short squeeze happen soon, the stars could align for a second time.","Whether you’re a first-time listener or you’ve heard every episode, we’d like to know what you think about the show.

Summary

Bitcoin (BTC) surged more than 10 percent for the second consecutive week as BTC options began trading on CME (CME).

Altcoins including Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) gained sharply as demand for cryptocurrencies seemed to widen.

Bitcoin Satoshi Version (BSV) more than doubled on the week amidst a flurry of speculation.

Market trends this week

BTC rallied hard in the last week to reclaim $8,500. It was the second straight week of double-digit gains. Bulls retook control of the market as BTC options launched on CME. Since December, industry exchanges such as Bakkt, OKEX, and FTX have begun offering similar services, but CME is the first major U.S. futures exchange to do so.

BSV more than doubled this week amid unconfirmed rumors that advocate Craig Wright obtained private keys to a wallet with millions of BTC. BSV is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) created due to a conflict with the BCH community. BCH also surged on the speculation.

On the macro front, tensions between the U.S and Iran cooled, especially after the accidental downing of a Ukrainian airline triggered protests in Tehran.

BTC has begun the year with a strong move. Market participants will watch for signs of the momentum continuing, or prices consolidating. Tensions in the Middle East have helped fuel trading volumes so far in 2019.

Aside from prices moving too far too fast, there is little reason at this time to expect a significant drop in BTC. Stagnating hash rates, a major concern toward the end of last year, have reversed course and are now at their highest levels.

Other potential catalysts include global equities markets and the Middle East. Traders should watch the $9,100 level as resistance and roughly $8,000 as support.

The email, sent by KyberSwap to its registered users on Thursday, says that the exchange has taken the move in response to the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which went into effect on January 10.

The directive requires EU crypto firms to implement know-your-customer (KYC) measures and report any suspicious customer activity. This requires some degree of record keeping and obtaining information about the source of funds. Crypto firms will also have to appoint someone to oversee compliance and train staff members in anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements.

KyberSwap is currently operating in Malta and will move to the BVI on January 24, per the email. The exchange said that “the new regulations would put too high a barrier for the majority of traders, both - regulatory and cost-wise” and therefore, it has decided to operate the exchange from the BVI.

As a result, KyberSwap will no longer be operated by Malta-based Kyber Network International Limited and will be operated by KYRD International Limited, a sister company incorporated and based in the BVI, per the email.

KyberSwap said its team and leadership will remain the same.

The non-custodial exchange is currently the second-largest, and is in a neck-and-neck competition with rival Uniswap, according to The Block’s research.

KyberSwap is not the only exchange to move out of the EU bloc in response to 5AMLD. Last week, crypto derivatives platform Deribit said it is leaving the Netherlands to avoid the directive. The platform will be run from Panama, effective February 10.

Some crypto firms, on the other hand, have closed down in response to the directive. These include crypto payments firm BottlePay, crypto mining pool Simplecoin and bitcoin gaming platform Chopcoin, among others.","Mobile wallet provider BRD is making something of a pivot, launching a suite of tools aimed at allowing blockchain developers to more easily build apps for enterprises.

These bring the ability to automatically pull in on-chain data via an API and, BRD says, conduct transactions in “near real-time” on multiple blockchains.

Nodes can be hosted “out of the box,” BRD says. Blockset supports bitcoin, bitcoin cash, XRP, hedera and ethereum at launch, with more to be added during the year.

“Blockset … will fundamentally realign BRD’s business model for the high growth demands of the financial services and banking industry worldwide,” according to the company.

The suite has been under evaluation in private pre-release by a number of firms including Ripple, SBI Holdings and KPMG, according to the announcement, with BRD aiming to soon bring in partners to help grow adoption.

All in all, the firm says the benefits of its new product include cutting hosting and developments costs, reducing build time and potentially the promise of new enterprise use cases for blockchain.

Around 90 percent of major banks are now exploring blockchain and cryptocurrency, said Adam Traidman, BRD’s CEO and co-founder. “That is why we developed our own proprietary platform (Blockset) which banks, financial services, and large crypto companies will now be able to leverage to accelerate their time to market and deliver enterprise solutions to scale on a global basis for a fraction of the development costs.”","Why did this happen?

Patrick McDonnel, also known as Jason Flack, was also ordered to pay $224,352 in restitution fees.

“Mr. McDonnell used his knowledge of virtual currencies to scam investors. While he thought he could outsmart law enforcement, his arrest, and today’s sentence shows, no matter where you are, what’s done in the dark will be brought to the light,” stated USPIS Inspector-in-Charge Philip R Bartlett.

As previously reported by Hard Fork, McDonnel was initially accused of scamming at least 10 individuals out of $194,000, 4.41 Bitcoin ($17,706.11), 206 Litecoin ($12,520), 620 Ethereum Classic ($2,976), and 1,342,634 Verge ($10.079).

He was accused in a nine-count indictment unsealed in a New York federal court in March last year.

McDonnell’s operation fraudulent operation ran from approximately November 2014 until January 2018.

During this time, McDonnell portrayed himself as an experienced virtual currency trader on social media, promising investors he would provide trading advice and buy cryptocurrency on their behalf.","In the wake of a reasonably low risk-appetite following a dubitable Sino-US “Phase One” trade deal with no signs of further improvement in tariff talks before November US Presidential election, safe-haven appeals seemed to be resonating louder since the beginning of the year, while crypto markets have already posted double-digit gains over the first two weeks of 2020 as a number of traders were leaning towards cryptos despite a slew of legal backlashes and regulatory setbacks in multiple countries including the municipality of Beijing which had recently banned mining and trading of cryptocurrencies.

Nonetheless, despite a gloomier stance of cryptocurrency market in a longer-term outlook, crypto assets inflated more than 23 per cent on an average over the first two weeks of the new year, while the overall market cap of the cryptos had already reached a lump-sum of $240 billion from a stark total of $192 billion recorded on December 31st, 2019.

Citing statistics, Bitcoin, the original crypto, which composes nearly 66 per cent of entire digital currency market, gained 22.71 per cent to $8,795.72 this year so far, and 84 per cent traders remained net long, triggering possibilities of further upside momentum, while Ethereum, which took the heaviest battering last year since most of the ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) were executed through Ethereum since 2017, gained 30.51 per cent to $167.59 so far this year.

Aside from that, Ripple gained 20.19 per cent to $0.2315 over the first two weeks this year, while Litecoin scored a monthly gain of 42.05 per cent to $58.82 thus far."
2020-01-18,"This week saw Bitcoin price (BTC) hitting the $9,000 barrier amid the launch of CME Bitcoin options and Plaid’s acquisition by Visa, reaching a record price for the last two months.

Bitcoin’s 27% price gain since the beginning of the year along with the future bullish scenarios laid down by investors may attract new crypto holders. But since BTC/USD is traded 24/7, new investors may be wondering: is there a difference between investing on a particular day of the week?

Figure 1. Crypto market data, 1-day performance. Source: Coin360

The basis of a difference in a day of a week returns comes from traditional stock markets. It has been shown that stock returns on Mondays are, on average, negative. This is called the Weekend Effect. One explanation is that the effects on a particular stock will only be felt on Monday since the market is closed during the weekend. However, the cryptocurrency market is always open: Could we expect the same behavior on Mondays for Bitcoin?

Bitcoin weekly trend in 2019

Analyzing Bitcoin returns from the beginning of 2019 until Jan. 13, 2020, data shows that Fridays present the highest average return across the days of the week at 1.1%. In contrast, only two days of the week show negatively average returns, Tuesday (-0.24%) and Thursday (-0.97%).

If an investor only started investing at the start of 2019 on a particular day of the week, Friday would present the best cumulative return, followed by Monday (Figure 2). Taking Fridays as an example, it’s assumed that the strategy would be to buy BTC closing price on Thursdays and sell it at the closing price on Fridays.

The closing prices (UTC timezone, a rolling 24-hour period) are used for simplicity reasons since the desired time to buy and sell during those days is based on the investor’s preference. The same buy/sell rationale applies if another day of the week is chosen to conduct the strategy (i.e. Monday).

Figure 2: Cumulative Return for investing on a specific day only between January 2019 and January 2020

Bitcoin weekly trend in the long-term

Taking a deeper look at Bitcoin returns for a longer time period, as seen from Figure 3, we can conclude that Mondays offer the best average return from all the days of the week (0.54%).

On the other hand, Thursday and Wednesday are the worst days of the week to invest in Bitcoin with an average return of -0.09% and -0.23%, respectively.

Bitcoin’s Monday anomaly case is reinforced from a statistical perspective since Monday is the only day of the week with a statistically significant result from the used regression models.

Curiously, as a truly anti-status quo coin, Bitcoin shows a mean positive return on Mondays, in contrast to traditional stock markets’ Weekend Effect.

Figure 3: Average Daily Return for each Day of the Week between April 2013 and January 2020.

Using the same long-term sample starting in April 2013, an investor choosing exclusively one day of the week as a strategy would get the best option by choosing Mondays, followed by Saturdays, as seen from Figure 4.

Figure 4: Cumulative Return for specific day investment during the entire sample analyzed (Between April 2013 and January 2020)

Day of the week during market bubbles

We cannot ignore Bitcoin’s explosive gains from two highly volatile periods seen in 2017 and how those influence the average returns for the longer time sample. By isolating that year, we find that Monday still shows the highest average return (1.5%) across the days of the week, followed by Thursday (0.55%).

Figure 5: Average Daily Return for each Day of the Week between during 2017

In summary, Bitcoin’s unique features reveal an opposite behavior to traditional stock markets, showing a positive average return on Mondays when considering wider time periods. However, when dealing with shorter time frames, we identify Fridays as the day with the highest average returns across the days of the week.

As reported by Cointelegraph, a study in September 2019 showed that Bitcoin holders make a profit after an average of 1,335 days, or roughly three years and eight months. Overall, holding BTC has been profitable for over 94% of days Bitcoin has existed, according to the latest data from Bitcoin Hodl Calculator.

Bitcoin, baby!","New Guidelines Subject Canadian Crypto Exchanges to Securities Laws

Canadian regulators have issued new guidance determining when current securities legislation applies to operations conducted by cryptocurrency exchanges. According to the clarifications in the document, many domestic and foreign entities serving Canadian users, for example those that provide custodial services, will have to abide by the country’s securities laws and act like securities dealers.

CSA Tries to Explain When Cryptos Are Securities

The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), a council of the regulatory bodies of Canada’s provinces and territories, published on Thursday Staff Notice 21-327 Guidance on the Application of Securities Legislation to Entities Facilitating the Trading of Crypto Assets. The legal interpretation, which comes after a consultation paper proposed a framework for crypto asset trading platforms in March, is supposed to help operators identify situations where Canadian securities laws may or may not apply to their activities.

The CSA explains that in certain cases crypto assets clearly represent securities. A tokenized security, for instance, carries rights that are traditionally attached to common shares such as voting rights and rights to receive dividends, the organization notes. A crypto asset can also be a derivative, the CSA remarks, like when a token provides an option to acquire an asset in the future. The regulator points out:

Securities legislation may apply to platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of crypto assets that are commodities, because the user’s contractual right to the crypto asset may itself constitute a derivative, a security or both.

The agency notes that the relevant determination will depend on the specifics, including “the obligations and intention to provide immediate delivery of the crypto asset.” Trading platforms would not be subject to securities legislation if “the underlying crypto asset itself is not a security or derivative,” or when the contract for the purchase, sale or delivery results in an obligation to make immediate delivery of the asset to the user.

In an attempt to define what constitutes ‘immediate delivery,’ however, the CSA admits there is no “bright-line test” to determine whether a contract or an instrument results in an obligation to make and take immediate delivery of a crypto asset. At the same time, a crypto transaction may be subject to securities laws if it does not clearly result in such an obligation.

The CSA staff will examine the terms of the contractual arrangements between crypto exchanges and their users as well as their typical commercial practices to establish if they create an obligation for immediate transfer of ownership, possession and control of crypto assets. The organization which coordinates the regulation of capital markets across Canada also details:

As part of this analysis, we will consider whether the platform and the user intend, at the time the contract or instrument is entered into, to make and take delivery of the crypto asset on which the contract or instrument is based.

Custodial Platforms to Operate as Securities Dealers

Then there’s the question of how to establish not only whether but also when exactly a crypto asset has been delivered. According to the guide, an immediate delivery occurs when ownership, possession and control is immediately transferred by the exchange and the user is afterwards free to deal with the asset without further participation of the platform. Also, the exchange must not retain any security interest or other legal right to the asset and the user should not be exposed to any risks related to the platform in the future.

Relations with exchanges, domestic and foreign, providing custodial services will be subject to securities regulations as there’s no obligation for immediate delivery of the assets to a user-controlled wallet. Clients remain reliant on the platform and exposed to insolvency, fraud, and other risks on its part. This means that following the new guidance, many of the hundreds of crypto exchanges operating globally will have to apply and be licensed as securities dealers to work in Canada, if they maintain their current business models, the Globe and Mail noted in an article.

The notice issued by the CSA contains many abstract statements such as “focus on substance over form,” “typical commercial practice,” and “intention to make and take immediate delivery.” This highlights how difficult it is to produce clear definitions and apply the traditional set of terms and rules to the trading and exchange of cryptocurrencies and other crypto-related activities. The regulator acknowledges that “new fintech businesses may not fit neatly into the existing framework” and invites such companies to join its regulatory sandbox. Participants in the initiative will enjoy a faster application process for exemptive relief from Canada’s securities law requirements, the CSA promises.

Of that figure, $4.89 billion was in the form of block rewards – that is, the 12.5 BTC generated every time a new transaction block is created. The rest – some $146 million – was made via transaction fees.

That reward number is set to change later this year during the so-called halvening, when the per-block subsidy will drop from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.

The $5 billion figure represents a decline from 2018's revenue level, when miners made an estimated $5.26 billion. By comparison, 2017's estimated revenue came in at $3.19 billion, as shown in the graph below.

As noted in The Block's 2020 Research Outlook report, the revenue figure is estimated on the basis that miners sell their bitcoins immediately, which is not exactly accurate as some companies retain a portion of their mined BTC to sell at a later date.","Crypto Employment Abounds With More Than 8,000 Jobs in 2020

The Tezos Foundation has launched a cryptocurrency faucet to dispense a small stream of XTZ tokens to users.

The funds in the faucet are intended for testing and development purposes, according to the site. And while there are limits, the faucet’s home page invites normal users to claim funds as well.

Unlike some other faucets, Tezos’ faucet dispenses XTZ tokens that are worth real money. Or, as the faucet’s main page puts it: “This is real (mainnet) tez and has a market value…Please drink responsibly.”

It’s not clear why Tezos is giving away money, but it’s hard to complain when the project is paying out of its own pocket.

The Return of Faucets?

There are several limits in place to prevent users from taking more than their fair share.

Tezos’ faucet pays out 0.01 XTZ (1.5¢) per request. It also prevents users from claiming more than once per day based on their IP and wallet addresses. Tezos adds that it may change those limits at any time, or discontinue the faucet entirely.

Despite these restrictions, one request gave us enough tokens for a test drive.

We were easily able to stake 0.01 of XTZ via the Tezbox online wallet. Thanks to Tezos’ low transaction fees, we were also able to send the funds to an existing address for free, though sending those funds to an empty wallet would have come with a cost.

It should be noted, that most official faucets payout testnet tokens with no real value other than they can be used to test various dApps. Meanwhile, third-party faucets payout real crypto but have high payout thresholds.

Neither of these approaches is much like Gavin Andresen’s original faucet, which gave away Bitcoin with no strings attached in 2010.

Tezos can afford to be generous, but if users find a way to exploit the system, the faucet may not last for long. As an example, Stellar shut down its recent airdrop in December after fake accounts tried to claim funds.

Though Stellar’s airdrop was more profitable than Tezos’, zero-barrier giveaways may no longer be practical.",,,
2020-01-19,"As Bitcoin enters its twelfth year, the past eleven offer a meaningful amount of time to identify key trends that have emerged around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. These trends provide insights that are helpful in projecting the future of the digital asset space and how it will take shape over the next decade.

In reflecting on the history of cryptocurrencies over their lifetime, there’s one pattern that immediately jumps out. Each successive wave of interest in the cryptocurrency space has been galvanized by new developments in the ecosystem. In particular, two significant catalysts were the rise of crypto exchanges and the initial coin offerings craze.

Rapid acceleration

These days, crypto users are spoilt for choice when it comes to exchanges, so it’s easy to overlook the seismic impact that these platforms had when they first emerged. Although Bitcoin launched in January 2009, it was over a year before Bitcoin Market — the first cryptocurrency exchange — opened its doors in February 2010. Other exchanges swiftly followed, including the now infamous Mt.Gox. It took less than eleven months from the opening of Bitcoin Market for Bitcoin to achieve parity with the United States dollar.

Fast-forward to 2016, Ethereum unleashed its ERC-20 token standard to the world, which quickly evolved into the 2017/2018 ICO boom. Whether people loved it or loathed it, the ICO craze was probably the biggest moment in the industry’s history. Once tech entrepreneurs became aware of how easy it is to create their own token, the blockchain scene — and the price of Bitcoin — exploded.

Related: ERC-20 Tokens, Explained

Even before Bitcoin hit its peak price of $20,000 in December 2017, there was talk of the ICO bubble bursting. In a nascent sector where so many companies claim to offer a unique value proposition that is often a carbon-copy of its peers, it’s inevitable that many of them would eventually fizzle out.

However, the crypto sector is unusual in that the value of the underlying technology is often perceived in line with market capitalization. Once the crypto winter hit, it hit hard. Once the crypto winter hit, it hit hard. As the prices remained low from the beginning of 2018 all the way until the spring of 2019, the perceived value of blockchain also went down, along with the value of the vast majority of tokens that had been issued during the boom. One study reported that less than half of the projects were still active a mere five months after their token sales.

Crypto cannot live by hype alone

Since the 2018 crash, it’s become increasingly evident that hype alone cannot sustain the industry. The vast majority of firms that promised to “revolutionize” existing industries through the introduction of a token have failed, leading to criticisms that blockchain is “a solution in search of a problem.”

Despite the critics, Bitcoin and many altcoins have survived well. But what’s clear is that many of the initiatives that survived the crypto winter did so by keeping their promise and offering a real-world use case. There are several examples that illustrate this point well.

Related: What’s Next for the Industry as ‘Crypto Winter’ Thaws?

Proving provenance

Supply chain was one sector where blockchain appeared to have a lot to offer, promising transparent proof of provenance from factory to end consumer. In mid-2019, Gartner reported that over 90% of blockchain-based supply chain projects were failing. This is allegedly because the technology was failing to live up to the hype.

However, there are several notable examples of multinational firms using blockchain in supply chain and logistics, indicating that the tech’s use case does indeed hold value. Maersk implemented its TradeLens blockchain solution in 2018, which now boasts 90 partners and was adopted by the Thai customs agency in August last year. Coca-Cola is another case in point, having expanded its pilot solution from two to 70 partners late last year.

Gaming

Gaming is another example of a use case where blockchain is adding real value. In-game assets are big business, with the virtual goods market worth over $50 billion. However, without blockchain, the assets themselves have no underlying value and are under the control of the game developers and publishers. Non-fungible tokens may well be set to transform the gaming sector, enabling users to take full ownership of one-of-a-kind assets, as pioneered by games like CryptoKitties.

There are other applications in the gaming sector. Royalty payments have been an ongoing challenge, with Microsoft Xbox developers working to resolve payment delays of up to 45 days due to difficulties in manual calculations and distribution. The company partnered with Ernst & Young to develop an automated, blockchain-based solution for its royalty payments, creating a more efficient, streamlined process.

Creating interest in interest

Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, it’s been virtually impossible to earn decent returns from good, old-fashioned savings accounts. Now, interest-earning accounts for cryptocurrency are opening up new avenues of passive income that doesn’t involve pure speculation on the volatile crypto markets or an active investment strategy.

One of the most popular ways is lending, allowing holders to deposit their funds on a loan platform so other users can take a loan, providing interest to the lender. However, staking offers another way of generating returns, where proof-of-stake blockchains distribute the equivalent of mining rewards to network participants.

Regardless of which lending solution crypto holders opt for, the returns are generally far higher than one would get from placing funds into a traditional bank savings account. Of course, the risks may also be more significant, depending on the type of investment and the chosen platform.

Store of Value

The original use case of Bitcoin was as a store of value, and it remains one of the biggest growth drivers today. Over recent years and throughout the crypto winter, citizens in countries including Venezuela, Argentina and Iran have turned to Bitcoin as a means of protecting their wealth from the effects of hyperinflation. Global or political events may also have an impact on the appeal of cryptocurrencies as a store of value.

The real-world use case of blockchain as a reprise from hyperinflation demonstrates the bridge being established between the emerging technology and a current economic problem.

More room for improvement

Despite the progress, there is still plenty of room for improvement. In particular, the barrier to entry for new users remains a major issue for the cryptocurrency space. Even now in 2020, owning digital currency often still means navigating unfamiliar technologies and platforms. This can be off-putting to the less technologically capable users, however, organizations such as Skrill are working to eliminate the barriers to entering the crypto space.

Reputation is a separate challenge. In 2019 alone, there were 12 high-profile attacks on exchanges. Scams are also still all too common. It’s an unfortunate reality that the biggest stories about crypto tend to be scandalous, and therefore make headlines in the mainstream media. For example, the BBC’s Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, covering the disappearance of OneCoin’s Dr. Ruja Ignatova, was a major viral hit.

The reality is that for many people uninitiated to cryptocurrency, stories like this will probably form the basis of their perceptions.

Building the reputation of crypto

None of this is to detract from the efforts of key players in the industry to establish a more reliable reputation for cryptocurrency. Coinbase has always worked hard to hold itself up as an example of how exchanges can operate in compliance with regulators. It was the second company to win the coveted New York Bitlicense, followed by others such as Xapo and Bitstamp. In the United Kingdom, Kraken Futures operates under the supervision of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.

However, the entry of existing reputable payment firms and banks into the crypto space is critical to increasing adoption among new crypto users. This serves several purposes.

Firstly, their entry creates a concrete link between the existing financial world and the new world of digital assets. As outlined above, creating a real-world bridge between any particular industry and blockchain is a proven recipe for success in the space of emerging technologies. Furthermore, reducing the barriers to entry for new users is critical if crypto is to attain widespread adoption.

A less tangible benefit — but one that is no less important — is to further bolster the reputability of cryptocurrencies among the uninitiated. This reputational problem can be solved by creating a bridge between established, trusted financial services and cryptocurrencies.

The eleven years since Bitcoin’s launch have been a rollercoaster ride for anyone involved in the space. But during that time, the token has grown from its cypherpunk roots to becoming a credible investment vehicle. Meanwhile, the potential of the underlying technology has only just started to make its mark on industry and the economy. Further removing the barriers to entry will go a long way toward allowing cryptocurrencies to settle into their niche among the existing financial infrastructure. Once that happens, widespread adoption should soon follow.

Proposed Crypto Depository for Government

A lawmaker has introduced a bill in the U.S. state of Oklahoma seeking to create a governmental crypto depository. Senate Bill 1430, authored by Senator Nathan Dahm, was introduced on Jan. 15, according to the government’s website. Its first reading is scheduled for Feb. 3. The bill reads:

The legislature hereby authorizes the State Banking Department and the Oklahoma Department of Commerce to coordinate and develop plans … [to establish] a new type of financial institution to be a state-chartered financial institution and the central depository for virtual currency used by governmental agencies in this state.

“The purpose of this new state-chartered financial institution shall be to provide valuable financial and technical services to blockchain and virtual currency innovators and developers,” the text of the bill details. It further states that “Oklahoma is committing to partner with innovative technology, help develop next generation financial products, and safely grow unique technical and financial sectors in this state.”

The proposed entity will be designed to easily integrate into existing banking and financial institution regulations and “have the highest level of expertise with customer identification, anti-money laundering and beneficial ownership components,” the bill adds. It will also be “fully supported by blockchain technology and innovations.” This act will become effective on Nov. 1, 2020, and the plans and implementation strategy must be submitted by July 1 next year.

Other Crypto-Related Bills in Oklahoma

Senator Dahm authored another crypto-related bill which was introduced in Oklahoma on Jan. 25, 2019. Senate Bill 843 had its first reading on Feb. 4 and second reading on Feb. 7 but has seen no progress since. According to the state’s Securities Department, this bill is modeled after HB 70 that was passed by the Wyoming legislature last year.

Senate Bill 843 states that “a developer or seller of an open blockchain token shall not be deemed the issuer of a security and a person who facilitates the exchange of an open blockchain token shall not be deemed a broker-dealer if certain conditions enumerated by the measure are met.” The state’s Securities Department has analyzed the fiscal impact of this bill on its revenues but concluded that it is not determinable since the subject matter is new to the state’s regulatory framework.

In April last year, the state passed Senate Bill 700 which Dahm co-authored. It modifies the definition of “electronic record” and “electronic signature” within the Uniform Electronics Transactions Act to include records or signatures secured through blockchain technology. The bill was approved by the governor on April 25, 2019.

‘High-Level Expert Group’ Formed

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced this week that it has formed “a high-level expert group,” also known as the Blockchain Expert Policy Advisory Board (BEPAB). The organization described that the group’s primary goal is “to provide advice on its work on blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies; this will include the development of high-level blockchain policy principles.”

The intergovernmental organization currently has 36 member countries, with the European Commission participating in its work. Members engage with OECD experts and delegations from other countries; they are part of the council that oversees the organization’s work.

Yoichi Iida is the deputy director-general for G7/G20 relationship of the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The incoming chairman of the OECD’s Committee on Digital Economy Policy (CDEP) explained:

The BEPAB’s geographic diversity is critical to the development of international blockchain policy principles.

According to the announcement, this high-level expert group consists of 45 governments and representatives from the European Commission, the private sector, industry bodies, and civil society groups. The current list of members shows that there are 93 experts on the board in total.

Among members of the expert group from the crypto and blockchain sector are executives from the Libra Association, Facebook’s Calibra, Aidtech, Bitfury, BITT, Blockchangers, Block.one, Consensys, Everledger, Etoro, Infrachain, Iobuilders, Maker Foundation, Outlier Ventures, R3, Ripple, and SALT.

Other members include officials from the European Parliament and government agencies of various countries, including the U.S., Egypt, Japan, Germany, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and the U.K. Representatives from a number of central banks, blockchain associations, academic institutions, and industry bodies are also members.

OECD’s Blockchain Work

The OECD has acted as a strategic advisor to the G20 and has been working closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on national growth strategies and other policies. The organization has been developing blockchain policies over the past six years. Its work “includes research and analysis on financial consumer protection and financial education issues raised by ‘crypto-assets,’ the potential for the technology to support due diligence requirements in global supply chains, improving corporate governance mechanisms such as proxy voting, and the use of blockchain as a digital enabler of sustainable infrastructure,” its website describes.

The formation of the expert group follows the establishment of the OECD Blockchain Policy Centre in 2018. The center provides resources for policymakers and supports blockchain work by the organization’s Committee on Financial Markets (CMF) and Committee on Digital Economy Policy. Among other initiatives, the OECD also hosts Global Blockchain Policy Forums. The third one will take place in Paris from Sept. 30 to Oct. 1. Last year’s forum attracted 1,600 participants and 200 speakers.

Aerdt Houben, Director of Financial Markets at De Nederlandsche Bank and Chair of the CMF, commented:

We are engaging with a diverse group of experts and innovators in developing principles to guide governments and industry in pursuit of viable blockchain innovation and adoption.

The OECD has published a number of crypto and blockchain-related reports such as one released on Friday entitled “The Tokenisation of Assets and Potential Implications for Financial Markets.”

_____

We rarely make a big deal about crypto tech upgrades. We dissect them. We run them through our technology model. And we give you our objective analysis. Period.

But this is an exception. Ethereum 2.0 is now finally moving forward in a substantive way, and it’s slated to have far-reaching consequences — not just for Ether itself, but for virtually the entire crypto space.

Reason: Ethereum (ETH) remains, far and away, the world’s most popular smart-contract platform.

It’s where thousands of projects reside. And it’s the platform where folks all over the world are scrambling to build the virtual economy of the future.

The Ethereum network is so popular, in fact, that it’s routinely overloaded. Transaction times become agonizingly slow. Transaction fees become exorbitantly expensive. And it’s mostly been this way since 2017 — a chronic ailment that challenges the best minds.

Bad news? Not entirely. Developers and sponsors of other, competing smart-contract platforms often wish they could have the same “disease.”

Chronic congestion on the Ethereum network signals vast and growing worldwide adoption, arguably the single most important factor in the long-term success of any cryptocurrency.

But the big disparity we see between popularity and practicality cannot last forever. Ethereum users can only put up with annoying network congestion for so long before they start looking for alternatives.

That’s what has given rise to the likes of Cardano (ADA), EOS (EOS), Tezos (XTZ), and others, all promising to be “new and improved versions of Ethereum.”

Would any of them make sense if Ethereum was already the fastest and cheapest smart contract platform on the planet? Probably not.

This is one reason why Ethereum 2.0 is such a big deal. If it works, it could seriously throw into question the raison d’être of wannabe Ethereum killers that have staked their futures on knocking the world’s No. 1 smart-contact crypto off its perch.

Why? Because according to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, when Version 2.0 is fully implemented, the time required to confirm a transaction will drop from minutes to a meager three to six seconds — about as long as it takes to swipe a credit card.

Two major upgrades in the Ethereum code would make this possible.

The first Ethereum upgrade is sharding

Remember: A blockchain is a database. And as the name implies, the databased is made up of a chain of blocks. Each block records a batch of transactions. And each block is linked to the next block in the chain in chronological order.

The problem: If there’s just one single blockchain on which ALL transactions must be recorded, it can create a massive traffic jam.

Imagine a single-lane superhighway with new traffic trying to ramp in from all sides. One obvious way of solving the problem: Build more lanes. In other words, run a bunch of parallel blockchains at the same time. Each shares its work across the group.

Easy to say. Not so easy to do. And Ethereum is not the only one dealing with this issue. Other crypto projects have also been looking for solutions along these lines. They have the main blockchain. Then, they create a series of sidechains to share the workload. Think of it as the main highway flanked by side roads.

Can this boost speed? Sure. But it’s still a fundamentally flawed design because the sidechains all have fed into the main blockchain, which effectively creates a new bottleneck. What’s worse, each sidechain has its own tokens, rules, and validators. So, things can get too darn complicated.

Ethereum 2.0 does things differently; it uses a process called “sharding.”

Forget the superhighways and the side roads for a moment. Instead, walk over to a giant, disorganized library — so big and disorganized that it could take you years to find a single book. One possible solution: Assign each floor of the library to a single broad topic. Assign each row of bookcases to a subtopic. And then line all the books up alphabetically by author.

This is akin to sharding in the world of databases, with each shard representing one piece that’s ultimately interconnected with every other piece. And it’s not entirely new: Sharding is already a technique that tech giants routinely use to expand their massive databases.

Until now, only a few crypto development teams — Cardano, Hashgraph and now, Ethereum — have even figured out how this might be done in theory. None of them has actually implemented it in the real world.

The big news: Ethereum 2.0 may soon become the very first to do so.

The second Ethereum upgrade is Proof of Stake

One of the key reasons Ethereum has not been able to scale up to meet booming demand was that it essentially copied Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work approach.

With Proof of Work, miners compete to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. Then the winner gets to write a new block of transactions to the blockchain and claim the reward for doing so. This mining requires faster and faster computers, consumes massive amounts of electricity and ... takes TIME!

But in Version 2.0, Ethereum is slated to switch from the sluggish Proof-of-Work method to a much faster and efficient Proof-of-Stake approach.

It’s kind of like a lottery system. If you’re participating on Ethereum 2.0, each token you hold (ETH) resembles a lottery ticket. The more tokens you have, the better your chances of being chosen to write a new block to the blockchain and claim the reward.

Again, this is nothing new. Second- and third-generation blockchains already use Proof of Stake and do so pretty successfully. But Ethereum 2.0 adds some valuable new wrinkles.

All very exciting! But don’t expect instant gratification. Upgrading a public open blockchain — especially one as popular as Ethereum — is an epic undertaking, akin to overhauling motorcycle engines while careening down the highway.

In fact, it’s so difficult that legions of skeptics have famously doubted Ethereum 2.0 could ever be implemented. Now, however ...

Ethereum developers have finally revealed their roadmap to Version 2.0, and it’s remarkably elegant in its simplicity.

The main idea: The existing Ethereum network won’t actually be upgraded at all. Instead, Ethereum 1.0 will continue as before. And developers will release the first iteration of Version 2.0 right alongside it.

None of the current Ethereum users will get a black eye if they decide not to switch. Meanwhile, as the overhauls are implemented and refined, the original Ethereum will be gradually phased out.","Malaysia Announces Digital Asset Guidelines

The Securities Commission Malaysia has published the country’s guidelines on digital assets which set out the regulatory framework for token sales. All token offerings must now be carried out only through platforms approved by the commission. The guidelines also detail the obligations of approved platforms as well as the requirements token issuers must meet.

New Digital Asset Guidelines

The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) announced on Wednesday that it has released the Guidelines on Digital Assets pursuant to section 377 of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007. The commission explained that the guidelines incorporate feedback it received after issuing the consultation paper on the subject, adding:

The guidelines set out the requirements for all offerings of digital tokens to be carried out through an initial exchange offering (IEO) platform operator that is registered with the SC.

These platform operators must seek authorization from the commission and have a minimum paid-up capital of 5,000,000 ringgits ($1.23 million). Among other requirements, they must carry out the necessary assessment and due diligence to verify the compliance of the issuer, its board, and the token to be offered, the announcement details.

Implementing the New Rules

The guidelines also set out the requirements for anyone seeking to raise funds through token offerings. A prospective issuer must satisfy governance and capital requirements to be eligible to raise funds using this method. It must be a company incorporated and have its main business in Malaysia, with a minimum paid-up capital of 500,000 ringgits. “Issuers are required to demonstrate that their proposed project or business provides an innovative solution or a meaningful digital value proposition for Malaysia,” the commission further stated, noting:

An issuer may raise funds up to a ceiling of RM100 million and tap on investments from retail, sophisticated as well as angel investors, subject to the investment limits provided in the guidelines.

An offering must be accompanied by a whitepaper furnished to the commission and approved by an approved IEO platform. The whitepaper must contain material information on the issuer, the token, and how the funds are to be used. The commission explained that it will conduct “post issuance monitoring of the utilisation of the proceeds” after the offering has been completed, elaborating:

The guidelines will be brought into force in the second half of 2020 to allow potential issuers, platform operators and investors to familiarise themselves with the requirements in the guidelines … until the coming into force of the guidelines, no person is permitted to offer or issue any digital tokens in Malaysia.

The commission will work with relevant platform operators in assessing eligible issuers during the first phase of implementation of these guidelines. It is accepting feedback on the regulatory framework until May 15. Malaysia is already regulating the crypto sector and has approved several crypto exchange registrations.

2020-01-20,"An eighteen-year-old from Montreal is facing four criminal charges connected to a $50 million SIM-swapping scam targeting cryptocurrency holders, Infosecurity Magazine reported on Jan. 17.

The hacker, Samy Bensaci, is accused by Canadian authorities of being part of a ring that stole millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from American and Canadian holders. The theft is said to have occurred in spring of 2018, with Québec police representative Hugo Fournier saying that the hackers were responsible for the theft of ""$50 million from our neighbors to the south and $300,000 in Canada.""

Among the purported victims were Don and Alex Tapscott, renowned Canadian crypto entrepreneurs and co-authors of the book “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World.”

Don Tapscott confirmed to The Star to have been targeted by the scheme, while denying that the hackers succeeded in stealing his funds:

“We can confirm that last year a hacker attempted steal crypto assets from our company and its employees. That attempt was unsuccessful. We cooperated with the police [and] have been impressed with their determination to bring those responsible to justice.”

Bersaci was arrested in Victoria, British Columbia in November 2019. The following month, he was released on a 200,000 Canadian dollar bail ($153,000) and prohibited from accessing any online-capable device, including gaming consoles, as well as owning or exchanging any form of cryptocurrency.

Infosecurity Magazine reports that many of the individuals supposedly targeted by the hackers had attended the Consensus conference in New York. Rob Ross, SIM-swapping victim and manager of StopSIMCrime.org, told Infosecurity Magazine that hackers spot targets during these events.

What is SIM-swapping?

A SIM-swapping attack occurs when the hackers are able to trick the telecom company to transfer the victim’s phone number to the attacker’s SIM card. Though it is possible to do this by impersonating the victim with the telecom’s customer service, the companies are plagued by insiders that use their access to facilitate this type of crime. With a SIM-swap, attackers can bypass most authentication and password recovery mechanisms that rely on phone numbers.

Cointelegraph previously reported many such cases, including an August 2018 victim who sued AT&T for its alleged negligence in preventing the thefts.","The Bitcoin blockchain execution time dropped in January 2020 compared to the last quarter of 2019. Data gathered by LearnBonds.com shows that by January 15, Bitcoin execution time was 8.27 minutes. This is a drop of about 20% compared to December’s 10.36.

There was a steady increase in the transaction time from July to December 2019. The highest Bitcoin transaction time was recorded in November at 11.077 an increase of about 9% from October’s 10.07 minutes.

From the data, Bitcoin recorded the same execution minutes in July, September, and October at 10.07 minutes. Across 2019, Bitcoin’s quickest transaction time was recorded in May at 8.421 minutes.

Generally, the Bitcoin confirmation times stand at 10 minutes, however, this can be affected by various factors. With Bitcoin’s popularity, we have some congestion on the network leading to delays to confirmation of transactions.

The Bitcoin community is currently divided between having larger blocks and lightning networks as ways of solving the scalability on the network.

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s execution time remained lower across 2019 into the new year with an average of 0.22 seconds. This represents a difference of about 97% when compared to Bitcoin.

During the period under review, the transaction time of the second-highest ranked cryptocurrency remained relatively low, without any major significant shift. The highest transaction time was in May at 0.223 seconds while January recorded the highest time at 0.289 seconds, a difference of 22%.

On Ethereum, the confirmation time for transactions is affected by the amount of gas paid and the network’s congestion. In some cases, the gas price can spike when we have a short-term Ethereum price volatility.

Compared to wire transfer Bitcoin and crypto transactions generally are more efficient.

Bank wires can take up to five days for cross border transactions. For domestic transactions, it lasts about 24 hours. However, wire transfers can be distracted by delays occasioned by holidays or weekends making them unreliable throughout the year.

For Bitcoin, the network is always up regardless of the day. Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, the network has been running 99.98% of the time.

Among the top five cryptocurrencies, Ripple’s XRP had the lowest transaction time on the blockchain with an average of about 0.038 seconds. Compared to Bitcoin, the average difference in transaction time is 99.62% while Ethereum is 82%.

The highest transaction time was recorded in December 2019 at 0.04 seconds while the slowest time was between March, April, and May at 0.036 seconds to represent a difference of 10%.

It is worth noting that Ripple seeks to use XRP to power faster, less costly and more scalable payments across borders. RippleNet users can deploy XRP to source liquidity while carrying out cross border transactions to enable instant payments.

In other terms, XRP acts as a mediator for both cryptocurrencies and fiat exchanges. The platform seeks to replace the traditional cross border money transfers that are costly and time-consuming.

XRP’s faster transaction time can also be attributed to the centralization of the Ripple network. With XRP, there is no mining and all the 100 billion coins have already been created. Ripple uses the Unique Node List (UNL) where little amounts of energy are used to create new data nodes hence the faster transactions.

The tax agency wants to analyze cryptocurrency transactions, such as for bitcoin and ether, which are being used for “tax evasion and money-laundering,” news outlet PublicTechnology reported Monday, citing HMRC’s request for proposal document.

Specifically, HMRC is looking for a tool which, at a minimum, would help track seven digital assets - bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BTC), ether (ETH), ether classic (ETC), XRP, litecoin (LTC) and Tether (USDT) stablecoin.

HMRC would also prefer a tool that could develop the ability to track privacy-oriented coins such as Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Dash (DASH), per the report.

The tax agency is ready to spend £100,000 ($130,000) toward licensing for the chosen tool. It is inviting proposals from potential suppliers until January 31 and looking to start a contract on February 17.

Blockchain analytics firms Chainalysis, Elliptic and CipherTrace could be some of the potential suppliers as these firms help track crypto transactions. U.K.-based Elliptic, for instance, recently found over $400 million worth of XRP transactions related to illegal activities such as scams and Ponzi schemes.

“Many of these crypto-asset transactions are recorded publicly in a ledger known as a blockchain. Whilst the transactions are typically public, the participants undertaking them are not,” HMRC was quoted as saying in Monday’s report.

The tax agency is, therefore, seeking the “provision of a tool that will support intelligence-gathering methods to identify and cluster crypto-asset transactions into linked transactions and identify those linked to crypto-asset service providers.”

Last August, HMRC was also demanding customer and transaction information from crypto exchanges Coinbase, eToro, and CEX.IO. The tax agency had sent out letters to these exchanges requesting customers' names and transaction histories, stating that “these transactions may result in potential tax charges and HMRC has the power to issue notices requiring exchanges to provide this information.”","Maduro Opens International Crypto Casino

Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro has authorized the opening of an international casino at a luxury hotel in Caracas where bets must be placed in petros, the country’s national oil-backed digital currency. Several cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies can be exchanged into petros to wager in the casino. The proceeds are expected to be used for healthcare and education.

Casino for Gambling With Petros

The president of Venezuela announced Friday that he has authorized the opening of a casino at the Humboldt Hotel in Caracas where bets must be placed in petros (PTR). The hotel, located on the peak of El Avila hill, was reopened in 2018.

“I have authorized legal bets with petros,” he reportedly said during a joint radio and television broadcast. “For example, in the Hotel Humboldt, there will be an international casino and everyone who wants to bet will bet with petros, all those resources will enter the state for health and education.” Maduro elaborated:

You can come to bet. There will be offers, special prices. You buy your petro tokens, you can buy them if you bring yuan, if you bring yen, dollars, euros or any other cryptocurrencies … buy your petros and make your licit bets allowed by the state as contemplated by national laws.

Gamblers must acquire PTR to participate, Criptonoticias news outlet clarified, citing that the initiative aims to procure additional resources to boost Venezuela’s recessionary and hyperinflationary economy. While the Venezuelan president did not specify which cryptocurrencies are accepted, the government’s Petroapp allows users to buy PTR with BTC, LTC, and DASH.

Promoting Petros

The petro was officially launched in February 2018 by Maduro in an attempt to evade U.S. and European Union sanctions against some state officials and companies. However, many are calling the petro a scam and the U.S. has banned its use.

Last week, he decreed that the sale of all fuel sold by the PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned oil and natural gas company, for planes operating international routes be made in petros from now on, AFP reported. Some buyers of Venezuelan crude oil have reportedly halted purchases after the country started demanding payment of port fees in petros.

Furthermore, Maduro has decreed the mandatory use of the petro to pay for state document services including passports. In December, he approved bonuses in petros for state employees and pensioners. The government gave half a petro to 3.5 million public workers and 4.5 million pensioners in December to test the use of the digital currency for payments. In January, it announced that 1,233,093 people paid with petros at 7,422 stores throughout the national territory during that time period.

Sign of Casinos Returning to Venezuela

The Venezuelan authorities have traditionally frowned upon casinos, Criptonoticias described. In 2011, Maduro’s late mentor, Hugo Chavez, ordered the closure of bingo halls and casinos in the country. Since then, they have practically been extinct and it is only possible to bet online on certain permitted platforms, the news outlet conveyed, noting that Chavez referred to casinos and bingo halls on several occasions as places of prostitution, drug sales, and illegal activities.

Following Friday’s casino announcement, the media started reporting that Venezuela may be warming up to casinos again. The Humboldt Hotel’s casino is expected to begin operations in the coming months, but Maduro did not reveal whether he plans to open more casinos. He also did not provide details about the use of petros and other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, at the hotel. In addition, the publication added that the Venezuelan president did not clarify how to buy PTR at the casino, whether the Petroapp is needed, how to withdraw profits, or if there would be crypto ATMs on the premises.

In the meantime, there are many online casinos where bets can be placed in a number of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin.com’s gaming platform, for example, is filled with a wide range of casino-style games allowing players to wager and win with BCH and BTC. No registration is required, games are provably fair, and payouts are instant.

Bitcoin's dramatic overnight fall from $9,200 is telling a tale of buyer exhaustion.

A break below Sunday's low of $8,461 would invalidate the recent bullish trend and could yield a drop to $8,200-$8,000. Dips could be short-lived as the longer duration charts are still reporting bullish conditions.

Bitcoin may make another attempt to pass the 200-day average at $9,027 if support at $8,461 continues to holds ground.

Bitcoin’s price rally is looking tired following Sunday’s sudden drop from above $9,000. Even so, the bias remains bullish with support near $8,460 still intact.

The top cryptocurrency by market value ran past the 200-day average at $9,040 during Sunday’s Asian trading hours, raising prospects of a rise to the next major resistance at $9,400.

The ascent, however, was cut short near $9,200 and prices fell sharply by 8 percent to $8,461, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The majority of the drop occurred around 23:00 UTC.

Since then, the cryptocurrency has been largely confined to a trading range of $8,460 to $8,750.

With the sharp pullback from near $9,200, bitcoin engulfed the price action seen in the previous four trading days. This type of market action after a notable rally or at multi-month highs is indicative of temporary bullish exhaustion.

What matters now is the survival of $8,461 – the level at which the pullback looks to have halted in the last 20 hours. The same level saw bitcoin turn lower on Jan. 8.

Acceptance under that key support would confirm

bullish exhaustion and terminate the short-term uptrend.

At press time, bitcoin is trading near $8,640,

representing a 4 percent slide on a 24-hour basis.

Daily chart

Bitcoin charted a big bearish outside day candle on Sunday. These occur when the day begins with optimism but ends on a negative note, engulfing preceding day’s price action.

While the pattern is considered a bearish

signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of follow-through,

preferably a move below the low of the candle.

Should Sunday’s low of $8,461 be breached, chart-driven selling could gather pace, yielding a deeper drop to last Tuesday’s low of $8,104.

However, if the support holds ground, the bulls will likely have scope to inch back toward the 200-day average, currently at $9,027.

Hourly chart

Bitcoin has dived out of the ascending trendline rising from Jan. 3 and Jan. 10 lows in favor of the bears.

The pullback looks to have legs as the breakdown was backed by the highest selling volume (red bar) since Dec. 16.

So, a drop through the support at $8,461 can’t be ruled out. That would expose the next support located at $8,200 (horizontal line) and the psychological level of $8,000.

Weekly chart

Bitcoin jumped 6 percent last week, cementing the breakout from the long-term descending channel kicked off by the preceding week’s 11 percent gain.

Further, the 5- and 10-week averages have produced a bullish crossover and the MACD histogram is about to cross over to bullish territory above zero.

With the longer duration chart reporting bullish conditions, any dip to $8,200 or lower, may be short-lived.

The cryptocurrency will remain on track to test October’s high of $10,350, as long as the channel breakout is valid.","How Is Bitcoin Cash Different From Bitcoin Core?

The crypto space can be hard to break into for those unfamiliar with the jargon, lingo, and foundational knowledge taken for granted by the already initiated. Adding to this difficulty is the fact that there are several different cryptos which bear the name “Bitcoin.” Convoluted as this all may seem, the differences are pretty easy to understand. This article seeks to explain in simple terms the difference between two of the most popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC).

Bitcoin’s Genesis

Just before the first version of Bitcoin launched in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto described his creation in the Bitcoin whitepaper, or foundational document, as “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash,” which “would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” The ticker symbol for this currency was eventually set as BTC.

Over the years, however, as disagreements among community members and developers about scaling grew, it became clear that differences were irreconcilable, and that a split in the bitcoin community via a fork in the protocol would occur.

The Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork

One group wished to increase the block size significantly to allow for faster processing of transactions, elimination of high transaction fees, and greater ease-of-use as cash for everyday spending and payments. The other group argued that such high fees were necessary and even desirable, and that extremely slow transaction speeds were a tradeoff for a more secure network. Arguments have been made in favor of both sides regarding the issue of security and centralization, as this Twitter thread demonstrates.

On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) split from Bitcoin Core (BTC) via a hard fork, and the former now features 32MB blocks, whereas BTC has a theoretical capacity for a max “block weight” of 4MB via a controversial solution known as Segwit. Popular bitcoin core narratives have since evolved saying BTC is like “digital gold” that should not be spent, but only held and saved. This presents a clear problem where Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision was specifically for a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash.”

Onchain Scaling vs. Second Layer Solutions

Adding to the specialized language, buzzwords and other crypto terminology that inundates newcomers to the space is the idea of a second layer. This is exactly what it sounds like: a new layer on top of a blockchain where transactions and settlements can be made prior to being set in stone in the underlying chain. One such popular and developing second layer for BTC is known as the Lightning Network.

“Wait a minute,” a crypto newb might interject, “if the idea of bitcoin is to increase transparency, simplicity and trustlessness in transactions, wouldn’t a second layer only complicate things?” In this case the neophyte would be onto something. While second layer solutions such as the Lightning Network are often touted as being the answer to all of BTC’s scaling and congestion issues, as with Segwit, there are numerous criticisms and potential problems. One of which being the necessity of trusting unknown parties with the transmission of one’s funds, prior to said transaction being written into a block.

The Bitcoin Cash network does not rely on such a second layer as it has more capacity and speed for processing transactions directly onchain. Though there are critics of this approach as well, when it comes to the ability to use crypto as cash — and a readily-navigable user experience — the principle that unnecessary complications mean more potential problems comes into play, which is part of the reason BCH separated from BTC.

Trying Both Coins

The best way to understand the fundamental differences between Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) is to dive in and try the two currencies out. By sending small amounts back and forth with a friend, across multiple wallets, or using them to pay for goods and services, one gets a feel for how they work, can compare fees and transaction times, watch market value fluctuate, and begin to understand overall security and convenience, unique features, benefits and drawbacks.

The Bitcoin.com Wallet supports both BCH and BTC, is freely downloadable, and can be loaded with free bitcoin cash from the Bitcoin Cash Faucet. BCH and BTC can also be bought with a credit card, and more privacy-minded users might utilize local.Bitcoin.com, an encrypted-chat and blind escrow trading platform that allows the purchase and sale of bitcoin cash for several payment options including cash, with no invasive KYC (know your customer) policy.

Getting a feel for permissionless money and real economic freedom without a middleman or third party is exhilarating, and speaks to the movement of money into a new era as Satoshi Nakamoto, among many others, imagined. Whatever one’s preference when it comes to crypto — whether it be one coin or many — most in the space agree the vision that “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution” is something worth fighting for.

Zhao gave his comments in a tweet on Jan. 19 after famous crypto skeptic and gold bug Peter Schiff complained that he lost access to his Bitcoin (BTC). Invoking the phrase “SAFU” — a slanger term in the crypto community for “safe,” Zhao said:

“Many hardcore crypto [organizations] advocate storing your own keys. But the truth is, today most people are not able to secure a key even from themselves (losing it). A trusted centralized exchange is #SAFUer for most people. The numbers speak for themselves. Need to work on wallets.”

Zhao explained that he believes a centralized exchange to be safer option for most people. One Twitter user noted that the suggestion is particularly bad coming from Binance’s CEO, given that the platform has previously been hacked.

In early May 2019, Binance experienced a major security breach resulting in the theft of 7,000 BTC, equivalent to over $40.7 million at the time.

The burden of keeping keys safe

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin disagreed with the idea — popular among cryptocurrency proponents — that users should be responsible for safekeeping their keys and the system’s designer has no responsibility to avoid loss of funds caused by key mismanagement. He said:

“Disappointed at people replying to this with ‘crypto is what it is, it's your job to be super-careful and write down backup seeds in three places.’ We can and should create better wallet tech to make security easier.”

Buterin mentioned the idea of “social recovery,” a system that would allow multiple people you trust to use their keys in combination to enable the recovery of funds.

However, one commentator noted that social recovery systems have serious drawbacks, given that it makes multiple people targets to possible attacks. Additionally, social recovery requires a certain degree of trust for the people involved in the process.

Cryptocurrency’s complicated relationship with hacking

The prevalent immutability of the ledgers that manage most crypto assets is a big draw for many hackers, more so than traditional bank accounts. A bank transfer can be reversed while a cryptocurrency transaction in most cases cannot be, and thus the cybercriminal gets to keep their ill-gotten proceeds.

Bad actors trying to steal crypto assets are increasing their efforts. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the crypto-stealing viruses employed by the Lazarus hacker group, which is allegedly sponsored by the North Korean government, were recently updated, demonstrating ongoing and adapting efforts.

In reaction to the growing popularity of SIM swapping — a technique that allows the attacker to redirect the mobile traffic of the victim to a device under his control — United States lawmakers have appealed to the Federal Communications Commission to hold telecoms providers accountable for the consequences of successful attacks.","Anti-Money Laundering (AML) , Blockchain & Cryptocurrency , Cybercrime

How Cybercriminals Are Converting Cryptocurrency to Cash

Report: Methods Make Payments Difficult to Track

Cybercriminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to turn illicitly gained cryptocurrency into cash, which raises new concerns about enforcing anti-money laundering laws, according to a report by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.

See Also: Live Webinar | Software Security: Prescriptive vs. Descriptive

During 2019, analysts at Chainalysis traced $2.8 billion in bitcoin that criminal entities sent through cryptocurrency exchanges. They found that some exchanges known as ""over-the-counter brokers"" are being leveraged by cybercriminals to convert cryptocurrency that is paid out in ransomware and other attacks into cash for a fixed fee.

These brokers facilitate trade between individual buyers and sellers who don't want to transact on an open exchange, according to the report. And while most of these over-the-counter brokers are legitimate, there is a subgroup that the Chainalysis report calls the ""Rogue 100,"" which help circumvent laws, including anti-money laundering and know your customer regulations that are designed to ensure that businesses can identify their clients.

The emergence of these types of rogue cryptocurrency exchanges, along with technical advances, have made tracking virtual currency used in cybercrime, as well as terrorist financing, more difficult for law enforcement, the Chainalysis report finds.

""What's especially worrying are the advancements in technical sophistication that have enabled successful terrorism financing campaigns using cryptocurrency,"" the report states.

Rogue Operators

The Chainalysis analysis does not name any of these rogue cryptocurrency brokers. But it notes that these exchanges control their own digital wallets and frequently exchange bitcoins and other virtual currencies among themselves to make tracing these transactions more difficult to trace.

Given the low barriers to entry in establishing an over-the-counter broker, some of the Rogue 100 brokers may actually be individuals operating through apps, while others could be long-established criminal networks, Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin told Fortune in an interview.

In addition to these 100 brokers, the Chainalysis report found that two cryptocurrency exchange organizations, Binance and Huobi, are helping to convert illegally gotten bitcoins and other virtual currencies into cash. These two exchanges also appear to circumvent anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer rules, according to the report.

The study found that out of the Rogue 100 brokers, 70 have accounts on Huobi and received $194 million in bitcoin from criminal entities over the course of 2019. The report did not mention how many of the Rogue 100 accounts were on Binance.

In response to the Chainalysis report, Samuel Lim, the chief compliance officer of Binance, told Fortune that the company would continue to improve its proprietary know your customer and anti-money laundering technologies, as well as use third-party tools and partners to further strengthen the company's compliance standards.

A Huobi representative also denied wrongdoing.

""As an exchange that works closely with regulators and government agencies in every country we operate in, we practice a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to illicit activities,"" Ciara Sun, vice president of global markets at Huobi said in a statement provided to Bloomberg.

Growing Concerns

The use of cryptocurrencies to support cybercrime has begun to draw more scrutiny from U.S. federal agencies as well as Congress.

In October, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned by a U.S. Congressional committee about the company's plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra. In the hearing, the committee raised concerns about privacy issues as well as potential use of the currency for money laundering or to finance deals for illegal drugs and weapons (see: Congress Grills Facebook's Zuckerberg on Cryptocurrency Plans)

In November, the U.S. Federal Reserve warned that the increasing use of cryptocurrencies known as ""stablecoins,"" without proper safeguards and regulations, could pave the way for crime, including money laundering and terrorism financing (see: Federal Reserve Report Raises Concerns About 'Stablecoins')

The Chainalysis report urges law enforcement agents and regulators to become experts in crypto-based technology in order to start fighting money laundering in cryptocurrency. It also calls on exchanges to carry out more extensive due diligence on over-the-counter brokers and other nested services operating on their platforms.

Law enforcement can address such challenges by collaborating to trace funds and applying additional scrutiny to exchanges and cryptocurrency brokers, Levin told Fortune.

Terrorism Financing

Advancements in cryptocurrency have also enabled terrorist organizations to carry out sophisticated financing campaigns using cryptocurrency, Chainalysis noted in another section of its report.

The study analyzed two terrorism financing campaigns and compared them to determine how terrorist groups are improving their ability to attract donors online.

One campaign that Chainalysis studied, which took place between 2016 and 2018, was carried out by Ibn Taymiyya Media Center, the media wing of Mujahideen Shura Council in the Environs of Jerusalem, which has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, the report notes

A second campaign, which started early last year and is ongoing, was led by Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, as well as another unnamed terrorist organization.

While the Ibn Taymiyya Media Center campaign publicized a single bitcoin address for financing from its donors, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades organization integrated a bitcoin wallet into its website. The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades' bitcoin wallet generated a unique bitcoin address for each donor to which they could send contributions, according to the report.

Cybercriminals used this feature to make it more difficult to identify addresses and track transactions in and out of those addresses, according to the report. Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades even published a video on their website instructing people on how to donate anonymously.

The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades campaign that used unique bitcoin addresses raised more than $10,000, making it the most successful, according to the report. More than half of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades donations came from cryptocurrency exchanges, the study found.

""It's possible that in 2020 and beyond, more terrorist organizations will embrace cryptocurrency as a fundraising tool and push for further advancements that allow them to take in more funds and enhance their privacy,"" according to the report.",

A crypto whale is flexing its muscle after sending $445 million in Bitcoin between two wallets in a single transaction.

The lone whale moved the 51,511 BTC on Monday. The transaction fee cost 0.00002860 BTC – which amounts to just 23 cents. According to the crypto tracker Blockstream, the fee would have been 16% lower if the sender had used the Bitcoin scaling solution known as SegWit-Bech32.

This is the second mega Bitcoin transaction in a month. A separate whale recently moved 123,447 BTC worth a mind-blowing $1.1 billion.

Whale activity has picked up in the last week as BTC grows increasingly volatile. Here’s a look at the largest Bitcoin transactions in the last 24 hours.

Image by WorldSpectrum from Pixabay","Peter Schiff has been a staunch critic of BTC and cryptocurrencies generally for almost a decade now. Peter has shown a unique ability to analyze the problems that are inherent to the current global economic system and was one of the few people warning of the 2008 financial crisis. He is the exact type of person early-Bitcoin advocates have sought to convert to Bitcoin, so a lot of cryptocurrency advocates don’t take kindly to Peter’s assertion that BTC has “no intrinsic value” due to its lack of utility.

Peter has engaged in debate after debate with self-proclaimed cryptocurrency experts and shown himself to be a formidable opponent. The problem cryptocurrency advocates have to wrestle with is that Peter is completely correct when he criticizes BTC (formerly called Bitcoin) and its lack of utility, thus criticizing its intrinsic value.

Like most libertarians, Peter is a longtime critic of fiat currency and is an advocate for gold and other precious metals. The “digital gold” argument BTC advocates proselytize has failed to convince a gold bug like Peter, which seems to bother a lot of these cryptocurrency experts.

With the built up animosity towards Peter, it’s no surprise that he has been the whipping post for “cryptocurrency media” and “influencers” over the past few days after he posted on social media that his BTC wallet “got corrupted somehow and [his] password is no longer valid”:

I just lost all the #Bitcoin I have ever owned. My wallet got corrupted somehow and my password is no longer valid. So now not only is my Bitcoin intrinsically worthless; it has no market value either. I knew owning Bitcoin was a bad idea, I just never realized it was this bad! pic.twitter.com/6SJvDJOZU6 — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 19, 2020

Instead of trying to help Peter, Twitter users used the opportunity to criticize Peter as a “boomer” who didn’t understand passwords. The sham that is “cryptocurrency media” took the opportunity to produce countless articles implying Peter forgot his password, which he denied:

“So much fake news about how I forgot my wallet password. Can’t Bitcoin pumpers be honest about anything? I was very clear that I didn’t forget my password. My wallet no longer recognizes my correct password. Plus what’s up with over 3k people liking that I lost my Bitcoin?”

So much fake news about how I forgot my wallet password. Can't #Bitcoin pumpers be honest about anything? I was very clear that I didn't forget my password. My wallet no longer recognizes my correct password. Plus what's up with over 3K people liking that I lost my Bitcoin? — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 20, 2020

Assuming Peter does know his password, the most likely scenario here is that Peter’s wallet did get corrupted, and he will have to recover his Bitcoin using his seed words with another Bitcoin wallet. The problem is that this is not a straightforward concept and shows that BTC is not ready for mainstream adoption. The deeper problem is that Peter is exposing the problem with the mindless rhetoric repeated by the cryptocurrency crowd of “Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins.” This ideology is the precursor to the deeper “Code is Law” principle that the Ethereum founders popularized. These concepts defy all realities of society.

Because this philosophy underpins the cypherpunk mentality for BTC and other cryptocurrencies, it’s no surprise that Peter’s wallet doesn’t have recourse for this scenario. In fact there are few companies outside of Bitcoin SV (BSV) that are building solutions for non-tech savvy individuals like Peter because they view the use of non-recoverable keys as a feature. BSV companies like HandCash are taking this real-world problem seriously by having users authenticate with 2-factor systems such as SMS. This is similar to how I can reset my password to my bank account with proper authentication.

The “Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins” mentality is really only popular to hacktivists and others who want to remove laws from society. This idea is popular to those who think that sending malware to steal coins from innocent users actually transfers ownership of those coins to the hacker. If you guess my password and get into my bank account, the money isn’t yours, and if you steal the deed to my house, it’s not your house. If you’re seeing a pattern here, you see the fundamental reason why BSV cannot be separated from the legal structures that exist in the world.

While the social media trolls have actually further proven Peter’s critiques of BTC’s utility, Peter’s argument about BTC having no intrinsic value has yet to be appropriately refuted by his debate opponents, and Erik Voorhees was so unable to come up with an argument in favor of BTC that he instead had to pivot and argue instead why cryptocurrencies generally have intrinsic value. He didn’t do a convincing job with this pivot, either.

The reason why Peter hasn’t yet heard a valid argument for Bitcoin is because the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem doesn’t actually understand what makes Bitcoin valuable. Bitcoin (BSV) is a tool to write data to a distributed global ledger. This tool can be used to record a small amount of data (such as a simple record of a money transfer from me to Peter), or it can be used to record more complex data (such as a cryptographically unique issuance of a gold certificate).

Bitcoin is valuable because it puts no restrictions on the types of data that can be written to the blockchain, and it allows users to do so for very little cost. There is one global ledger, and it allows us, for the first time, to attach monetary value to digital data (Bit + Coin). If Bitcoin has value, then it has to provide value to Peter.

Let’s use a case study of the company Amleh who is building a gold-backed token on the Bitcoin (BSV) blockchain. What value does Bitcoin provide a gold buyer like Peter?

Scalability Gold can be tokenized on the blockchain down to the milligram, allowing buyers to purchase as little as four cents of gold.

Utility A gold-backed currency can exist without the use of trusted physical certificates that can’t be audited against the supply

Auditable We can remove the trust required when buying a gold certificate that the vault actually holds the gold.



As we can see, the value of the underlying ledger comes from the utility that applications built on top of that ledger enable. It is only the scalable blockchain solution provided by BSV that enables the use cases to bring real value to bitcoins. Instead of HODLing BTC and trying to rope Peter into the BTC Ponzi scheme, cryptocurrency enthusiasts should refocus their efforts on building real applications and solutions that give Peter a reason to actually want to own some bitcoin.

Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange Binance has launched peer-to-peer (P2P) trading services for the Vietnamese dong, Finance Magnets reports, January 20, 2020.

Binance Adds Support for Vietnamese Fiat

In a bid to expand its already growing business footprint, major digital currency trading platform Binance has officially launched P2P trading services for the Vietnamese dong. With this, Binance will now enable traders to buy, sell, and store four major digital currencies – Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Tether (USDT) – using fiat.

Notably, the move by Binance follows a series of development that witnessed the exchange introduce support for fiat. BTCManager reported in October 2019 how the exchange had added support for Russian Ruble in an attempt to capture the largely fragmented Russian cryptocurrency market.

In the past, Binance has stated that it plans to add support for as many as 180 fiat currencies to its trading platform. The exchange stayed true to its comments when in November 2019 it added support for Euro.

Commenting on the Vietnamese dong development, Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, said:

“Binance is committed to providing our global users with more convenient fiat gateways and easy access to cryptocurrency, and our P2P service aims to lower the barriers to entry to the crypto world. We are pleased to introduce fiat-to-crypto P2P trading services to Vietnamese users to flexibly trade cryptocurrency at low costs.”

Adding:

“Vietnam has enormous economic growth potential, a vibrant entrepreneurship landscape, and wide cryptocurrency acceptance, making it the next global blockchain hub. We look forward to expanding our services for the local community and supporting the growth of the Vietnamese blockchain ecosystem.”

Vietnam’s Attitude Toward Blockchain and Cryptocurrency

Akin to the vast majority of the countries, Vietnam has maintained a pessimistic stance toward cryptocurrency. In 2018, Vietnam’s financial regulator – State Securities Commission (SSC) – had put a blanket ban on companies from issuing, transacting, or brokering related to digital currency.

Conversely, the Asian country has shown signs of a positive attitude toward blockchain technology. As reported by BTCManager on November 5, 2020, the country’s TPBank had joined Ripple Inc.’s distributed ledger technology-powered (DLT) enterprise-grade payments network RippleNet.","Square Crypto, the crypto initiative begun by payment company Square, announced its first product on Tuesday: a ""Lightning Development Kit"" (LDK) to help developers integrate Lightning with their bitcoin wallet applications.

The new product includes an API, language bindings, demo apps, and other items that would ""make integrating Lightning easy, safe, and configurable,"" per a company blog post.

Square Crypto said it considered several projects and finally decided to go with a project focused on Lightning Network-wallet integration based on developer demand.

""We spoke with dozens of wallet developers. What we heard was a desire for flexibility when integrating Lightning. Wallets and applications require different key store and backup mechanisms, security approaches, UX tradeoffs, and more. That means the solution is building for more wallets, not fewer,"" the post stated.

In December, Square Crypto said it is offering grants to a part-time Lightning Network developer to support his work.

It has also hired three team members in September, two of whom have experience in development tied to Lightning.","Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the first digital currency investment vehicle to attain the status of a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company, Grayscale Investments said Tuesday.

New York-based Grayscale Investments, the world's largest digital asset manager, which offers 10 cryptocurrency investment products to institutional and accredited investors — four of which trade publicly and are also available to all investors — publicly filed a registration statement with the SEC on behalf of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in November.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the firm's largest investment vehicle, with $2.4 billion in assets as of Jan. 17.

The trust's shares are now registered with the SEC. ""As many institutions restrict investments in instruments that are not registered with the SEC, a broader set of investors may now begin to consider the trust accordingly,"" Grayscale said in a statement.

Michael Sonnenshein, managing director at Grayscale, said in an email that Grayscale voluntarily pursued this designation and will continue to work within existing regulatory frameworks.

""Grayscale Bitcoin Trust becoming an SEC reporting company marks an incredible milestone for the trust, Grayscale as an asset manager, and the digital currency industry as a whole,"" he said. ""Today's announcement should signal to investors that our regulators are willing to engage with our products and our space as a whole. Even though it will require more rigorous reporting standards, it is a new level of transparency and reporting that we believe investors deserve.""

The trust will now file its quarterly and annual reports, as well as audited financial statements, as 10-Qs and 10-Ks with the SEC.

The trust has a private placement, which is offered on a periodic basis throughout the year to accredited investors and is currently open. Accredited investors who own shares in the private placement will now have an earlier liquidity opportunity, as the statutory holding period will be reduced to six months from 12 months.","Crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank has made its first hire from the hardcore bitcoin community to support an ambitious roadmap for its business serving digital currency clients.

Benjamin Richman, formerly director of business development and partnerships at bitcoin tech startup Blockstream, joined the La Jolla, Calif.-based bank at the end of last month as director of digital currency.

“We’ve hired other folks that are from tech companies that were providing services to some crypto companies, and we’ve hired former law enforcement to help us with AML/KYC/BSA, but in the pure crypto space Benjamin might be the first,” Silvergate Chief Executive Alan Lane told CoinDesk.

The hire shows Silvergate’s deepening commitment to serving a niche where most banks fear to tread, owing in part to the high costs of anti-money-laundering, know-your-customer and Bank Secrecy Act compliance Lane mentioned.

At Blockstream, an outfit pursuing bleeding-edge tech improvements for bitcoin, Richman was responsible for the growth of Liquid, a sidechain, or parallel network sometimes used to move money between exchanges.

In his new job, Richman will be in charge of crypto customer growth for Silvergate. He is taking over the duty from the executive vice president of corporate development, Ben Reynolds, who will focus on the bank’s newer initiatives such as crypto-collateralized loans and the bank’s application for a New York trust company license.

Earlier this month, the bank launched the Silvergate Exchange Network’s (SEN) Leverage product, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans they can then use to buy more bitcoin, similar to margin lending in the traditional markets. The bank also applied for the New York trust license with the aim of providing custody and settlement for crypto.

The bank, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November, is one of a handful in the U.S. that will provide accounts to crypto exchanges, startups and traders. (Signature, Metropolitan Commercial and Cross River are among the few others.) Early last year, Silvergate sold its retail branch and business lending team to focus on its specialty business lines, including crypto, a rich source of low-cost deposits.

Richman isn’t the first executive to move from Blockstream to a fintech-forward financial institution, however. As CoinDesk reported this week, Jonathan Wilkins, a Blockstream co-founder, is now chief security officer at up-and-coming bitcoin brokerage River Financial.","Uzbekistan Prepares Crypto Tax Exemptions, Launches Licensed Exchange

A new presidential decree in Uzbekistan envisages the introduction of tax exemptions for income obtained from operations involving crypto assets. The draft document published recently also incorporates proposals for the establishment of a blockchain valley and licensing regime for cryptocurrency miners. The country has just launched its first licensed crypto exchange.

Tax Free Crypto Operations

The Central Asian Republic of Uzbekistan legalized cryptocurrency trading and introduced licensing for crypto exchanges with a decree signed by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in the fall of 2018. An earlier decree issued by the head of state in the summer of that year laid the legal grounds for other related activities in order to develop the country’s digital economy.

Uzbekistan now prepares to exempt income obtained in cryptocurrency operations from taxation. A draft-decree containing provisions to that effect has been published last week for public discussion. Furthermore, Presidential Decree ID-12538 “On the measures for further development of the circulation of crypto assets in the Republic of Uzbekistan,” excludes crypto transactions from the scope of the nation’s foreign currency regulations. The draft document details:

Operations of legal entities and individuals related to the circulation of crypto assets, including those carried out by non-residents, are not objects of taxation, and income received from these operations is not included in the tax base for taxes and other obligatory payments.

Earlier this month, the National Agency for Project Management (NAPM), a regulatory body responsible for the oversight of the digital economy including the crypto sector, announced its plans for 2020. One of the key priorities of the agency working under the presidency is to establish a “national mining pool” for all private miners who will enjoy preferential electricity rates. Also, all industrial-scale mining operations, according to the latest decree, will be subject to licensing starting from Feb. 1.

The government in Tashkent also intends to create a regulatory sandbox for testing crypto technologies called Uzbekistan Blockchain Valley. Authorities want to allow entities involved in the development of new financial products and services to implement them and conduct experiments without violating applicable laws. The proposals for the establishment of the pool and the sandbox came from NAPM, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan, the Ministry of Development of Information Technologies and Communications, and the Ministry of Energy.

Licensed Crypto Exchange Launched

Uznex, Uzbekistan’s new digital asset trading platform, is operated by the Korean company Kobea Group. Its launch was announced Monday, Jan. 20 during an opening ceremony in Tashkent where the Korean Cultural Center hosted an international blockchain conference. The event gathered representatives of crypto companies from South Korea, Japan, and Singapore as well as officials from Uzbekistan’s ministries and government agencies, the country’s national information agency Uza reported. Kobea Group also opened its first office in the region.

According to another report, by the local edition of Sputnik, Uzbekistan citizens will be allowed only to sell cryptocurrencies on Uznex.com, while foreign entities and nationals residing in the country will have full access to its services within the framework of the country’s legislation. For the time being, Uznex is the only cryptocurrency exchange operating legally in Uzbekistan and possibly in the whole region.

The platform is now online and offers several trading pairs against bitcoin core (BTC) and the stablecoin tether (USDT). These include bitcoin cash (BCH) and ethereum (ETH). According to the announcement quoted by local media, Uznex should support several fiat options such as Uzbekistan’s national currency, the som (UZS), U.S. dollar (USD), and credit cards. However, the fiat payment and withdrawal methods are not currently available on the Uznex website, which is still in beta.

The exchange will also serve global users in the future who want to invest in digital financial assets, make international transfers or need access to credit. The Korean operator intends to play an active role in Uzbekistan’s socio-economic life. Its plans include the establishment of blockchain departments in the country’s leading universities.

2020-01-22,"Bitcoin’s lightning torch is back, and it’s zipped through at least 38 countries already.

The torch is a digital game first ignited in January 2019 by pseudonymous bitcoin enthusiast Hodlonaut, known for his Twitter avatar of a cat in a spacesuit. Each “torchbearer” sends a tiny amount of bitcoin to the next. A key rule is to add a little bit more money to the payment each time it moves to someone new.

The goal is to highlight the speed and global nature of the lightning network, a payment technology that could solve or at least greatly ease some of bitcoin’s most critical problems. Started on a whim for fun, the torch became a global event, even carried by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, showing how frictionless and indifferent to borders the form of payment is compared to legacy methods like Visa and Paypal.

On Sunday, Hodlonaut lit the torch for the second time, in what he described as a “spur-of-the-moment decision.” Since then, many enthusiasts have been posting lightning “invoices” on Twitter to which the torchbearer can send the next lightning payment.

“Made over 30 passes across the globe as I slept!” Hodlonaut said on Twitter Tuesday morning.

Speaking to CoinDesk, Hodlonaut argued that one reason the torch has changed hands so speedily this time is that the big names and companies haven’t taken it.

“It has been almost exclusively held by ‘plebs,'” he said. “There has been no posturing, just lots of enthusiastic, normal bitcoin and [lightning network] users that have passed the torch along promptly, with no fuss. It feels very grassroots.”

Last time, it took longer than two weeks to get to 139 people in 37 countries. But the torch made some exciting stops on that tour. Despite worries about breaking U.S. sanctions, the torch made it to Iran last March. A group of Venezuelans received the torch with no electricity. In an interesting experiment, they powered their lightning node with a motorcycle battery.

The first torch fizzled out when it reached a hard-coded limit on how much lightning can be sent in a single payment. The cap is 4.29 million satoshis, the unit for one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. Developers could lift the cap (which works out to about $370 at current exchange rates) when they think the payment technology is secure enough.

Until then, Hodlonaut is eager to see how long the new torch lasts.","Most would agree that 2019 wasn’t a big year of cryptocurrency adoption–however, the industry did come closer than it ever had before. The introduction of Facebook’s Libra, Binance’s Venus, and announcements of plans by China and other nations around the world to begin or continue developing blockchain-based national currencies brought crypto further into the “mainstream” than ever.

Adoption was also arguably boosted throughout the year by political turmoil and boosts in the price of Bitcoin, as well as increased awareness regarding personal privacy and financial sovereignty.

However, in the grand scheme of things, crypto still has a long way to go–in 2018, EOS’ chief technical officer Dan Larimer suggested that a technology does not become a part of everyday life for most people until it has been proven to make their lives easier without being high-risk or high-cost.

And indeed, there does seem to be a cyclical nature in the way that new technology is adopted into the “mainstream”–and it can take time. For example, although email was invented in the early 1970s, it did not become widely available or widely used until the 1990s, and its usage has grown considerably since then; if cryptocurrency is operating on a similar timeline, it could be ten to twenty years before it becomes truly ubiquitous.

Still, progress has been made, if reflected in nothing but the Bitcoin network alone: in the last five years, the number of Bitcoin transactions sent each day has increased dramatically, and some analysts argue that this will continue to increase in the near future.

So–here, now, in 2020–who’s actually using Bitcoin? What are they using it for? And what are the factors that are known to be hindering cryptocurrency adoption?

Crypto adoption can look different depending on where in the world users are

According to the popular narrative, the ways in which cryptocurrency is used, to some degree, seem to fall along several lines, including the line between the developing world and the developed world, and the line between users and traders.

Let’s start with the first of these lines. There is, arguably, a major and important difference between the ways that crypto is used in countries with developed, stable economies and those without.

In 2018, Dan Larimer said that “so far, the early adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is very philosophical. It’s inherently limited to people who actually believe in the cause. That’s true with all early adoption. It’s true with electric cars. It’s true with blockchain.”

However, this statement is much more likely to be true for individuals living in countries with stable economies, who may not necessarily have a need to use cryptocurrency; for example, to protect the value of their savings in the face of an economic or political crisis. Instead, these users tend to go out of their way to use cryptocurrency to pay for something–perhaps something that isn’t completely essential.

For example, 2gether, a cryptocurrency payments app based in Spain, told Finance Magnates that according to a recent survey of its own users, “the everyday crypto user is a highly educated millennial male.”

Indeed, according to the results of the survey, “the majority of crypto spenders are between 26 and 45 years old”, and work in white-collar professions “the most common professions among users are lawyers, accountants, and economists. Typically, these users don’t pay for necessities, like housing or bills, with their crypto; instead, 2gether’s users “spend their cryptocurrency mostly on food and at restaurants.”

Could crypto payments apps boost adoption in developed countries

Of course, this doesn’t mean that using cryptocurrency primarily for paying for things in restaurants couldn’t eventually lead to widespread adoption, particularly within developed countries.

After all, Bakkt will test a consumer app with Starbucks in the first half of 2020, a move that may spark some additional interest in crypto from the “outside world.”

Kudos to them for teaming up with #Bakkt!#Crypto #Blockchaintechnology Coffee Drinkers Are Shaping Next Wave of Financial Innovation As Bankers Fear the Rise of Starbucks https://t.co/tDZDQ6jsTo — Timothy Yohe (@TimYohe) January 20, 2020

Charles Phan, chief technical officer at cryptocurrency exchange Interdax, told Finance Magnates that “if the trials go well, it could be a significant event for cryptocurrency adoption.” The app, which will allow consumers to exchange bitcoin for the US Dollar at Starbucks locations, “could be the catalyst that sparks off real merchant adoption.”

Providing the right kinds of incentives could also help to boost adoption amongst merchants. Will Reeves, chief executive officer of Fold, a crypto payments platform that provides BTC rewards for users told Finance Magnates that “especially when it comes to e-commerce, crypto adoption is a two-way street, including both consumers and merchants.”

“Merchants should be highly incentivized to accept cryptocurrency payments, because doing so dramatically reduces transaction fees and chargebacks—one of the greatest sources of fraud experienced by vendors,” he said, adding that “credit card fees eat up so much of vendors’ ROI that many stores like Walmart and Target are issuing their own credit cards.”

“By offering cashback and other promotions, they encourage consumers to use their store cards over credit cards with high processing fees,” Reeves explained. Therefore, he predicts that “we will see more merchants offering bitcoin cashback for consumers using their store-specific cards this year.”

In developing countries, crypto can be a safe haven; DeFi platforms offer financial services that may be otherwise unavailable

However, in developing countries around the world, the adoption of cryptocurrency is arguably higher than in developed countries. Additionally, the portrait of the average crypto user seems to be quite different.

Charles Phan told Finance Magnates that “the main use cases for cryptocurrency are as an alternative to currencies experiencing hyperinflation, as an alternative to gold or the banking system as a store of value, and as a convenient and fast payment system to send money internationally.”

As such, “we’re increasingly seeing bitcoin and crypto used as a hedge against political and economic instability in countries like Argentina, Turkey, and Venezuela.”

Indeed, a survey from Germany-based data analytics company Statista found that Turkey has the highest number of individuals who had owned or used cryptocurrency at some point in their lifetime.

Usage of cryptocurrency in developing countries is expected to grow further as the decentralized finance (‘DeFi’) sector continues to grow.

After all, DeFi platforms–which offer financial services, including loans–are “conceptually…going after this idea that finance should be as open as the internet, “ according to Zac Prince, chief executive officer of crypto finance and lending platform BlockFi.

Prince told Finance Magnates in an interview that according to the principals of DeFi, “it doesn’t matter where you’re from or how much money you have, you should be able to access the same product that someone who’s in a different place with a lot more money is also accessing.”

Additionally, DeFi platforms “don’t do KYC (know-your-customer) [checks],” which could make it much easier for individuals in rural areas who may not have access to internationally acceptable forms of photo identification (ie passports) to gain access to the loans and other financial services offered by DeFi platforms.

Institutional capital is important to the health of crypto markets

The line between the ways that crypto is used in developed and developing countries also seems to run parallel to the line between users and traders–in other words, individuals who use cryptocurrency in a practical way and entities (individuals and companies) that use cryptocurrency primarily as an investment.

“In developed countries, the use cases are more focused on trading and investing in crypto as a store of value,” Charles Phan told Finance Magnates.

“The biggest area of adoption in cryptocurrency is the trading of digital assets,” Phan explained. “Volume is rebounding as the cryptocurrency market exits long-term downtrend. With newer exchanges looking to make their mark in 2020, there will be more innovation and continued maturation, which will attract traders from traditional markets.”

Phan argued that an influx of traders from traditional markets–institutional traders, specifically–is quite important to the short-term health of the cryptocurrency markets, but may not be critical to the long-term survival of the crypto ecosystem: “a lot of capital has been allocated to cryptocurrency businesses and will not [survive] if the predictions of institutional adoption are not fulfilled,” he said

“However, chances are even without that, there will still be an ecosystem.”

User-friendliness is still an issue in 2020

But what’s preventing traders and users–institutional and retail–from entering the cryptosphere at a higher right?

The simple fact is that for many (or even for most), crypto remains esoteric and difficult to use and understand at a baseline level. For example, even though cryptocurrency wallets and various other kinds of platforms have come a long way from using command-line based interfaces, there is still progress to be made when it comes to making cryptocurrency easier to purchase, sell, send, receive, and trade.

Luke Stokes, Managing Director of The Foundation for Interwallet Operability (FIO), told Finance Magnates that this is a serious issue for the industry: “until we solve the usability problem of interacting with cryptocurrency itself, we can’t expect real-world adoption,” he said.

In order for cryptocurrency to be used practically, Stokes said that “it has to be as easy as Paypal, Venmo, and the like.”

Indeed, the Blockchain Usability report put together by the FIO demonstrated how frustrated most users are. According to the report, “only about 25% of respondents who sent crypto to someone else in 2018 indicated that they generally felt ‘very comfortable’ with transactions immediately after sending. The majority of users, about 58%, felt only cautiously optimistic. While the remaining 17% of users felt a general level of anxiety regarding a sent transaction.”

The legal situation in the United States is poised to either help or hurt crypto adoption

Additionally, legal concerns–particularly within the United States–could be one important factor keeping cryptocurrency adoption at bay.

Most experts would agree that the legal landscape in the US when it comes to the cryptocurrency is murky at best, and unnecessarily restrictive at worst.

However, for better or for worse, there has been progress: several pieces of cryptocurrency-related legislation are currently making their way through the US House of Congress, including two pieces of legislation that seem as though they could potentially open the door for further crypto adoption–the “Crypto-Currency Act of 2020” and the “Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020”–and several that could possibly hinder it further, including the “Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act” and the “Stablecoins Are Securities Act.”

Earlier this month, Michael Wasyl, managing partner at NYC-based corporate strategy firm DeerCreek, explained to Finance Magnates that the primary function of the Act is “to definitively put every type of crypto asset under the jurisdiction of some existing department,” which, at the very least, could provide some clarity as to which regulatory bodies are responsible for crypto.

Similarly, the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020 could provide clarity for the crypto industry and apply a more fair and practical set of tax rules to crypto. Robert Elwood, chief operating officer and Partner at Practus LLP, told Finance Magnates that “if enacted, the bill could spur widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies by alleviating what I like to call the ‘sandwich’ problem.”

“Under current law, cryptocurrencies are treated as property, which means that every transaction leads to taxable gain or loss, even simple and small transactions like using Bitcoin to buy a sandwich,” Elwood explained. “This is a record-keeping nightmare.”

Under US law buying a meal with Bitcoin is a taxable event. I wondered why the commercial industry hadn’t warmed to it yet. However if you’ve made a loss on your Bitcoin transactions, it could be tax deductible too, I’m guessing pic.twitter.com/ski6TXwiRY — Chuck Nakamoto (@CharlesNakamoto) January 21, 2020

The bill solves this problem by stipulating that “U.S. federal income tax is due on gains in cryptocurrencies only if the gain on a particular transaction is greater than $200. Accordingly, if the bill passes, using cryptocurrency for routine small transactions such as buying a sandwich would not involve the hassles of the current tax law.”

The “Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act” and the “Stablecoins Are Securities Act,” on the other hand, could make cryptocurrency law all the more complicated. Both pieces of legislation were written as reactionary tools to stop Facebook’s Libra from launching, but they could have a host of consequences–possibly unintended–for the industry as a whole.

However, even though negative legislation could slow the process of adoption, it’s ultimately up to the individuals who use it to determine the future of the industry of the technology. Therefore, Charles Phan says that crypto-hopefuls should keep their eyes on the prize: “Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether were built on grass-roots movements from the bottom up, so continued adoption is essential for long-term survival,” he said.

“The aim of the game is to create a new financial and economic system to make the world a better place: that can only be achieved if cryptocurrency becomes part of everyday life.”","Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of BTC.TOP, the largest mining pool on Bitcoin Cash, announced a proposal through a blog post that would redirect 12.5% of Bitcoin Cash Coinbase block rewards to a development fund. The fund is a Hong Kong corporation that has been set up to legally accept and disperse funds and would be provided funding for six months to support Bitcoin Cash infrastructure. The plan is to implement this proposal into Bitcoin Cash's May 2020 protocol upgrade. The fund would receive approximately 112.5 BCH per day and about 20,588 BCH over the six months. Based on the current prices of BCH, the fund would receive roughly $7.1 million in total.

The proposal has garnered support from other large mining pools part of Bitcoin Cash, which includes Antpool, BTC.com, ViaBTC, and Bitcoin.com. These five pools represent 34.5% or a little more than a third of Bitcoin Cash’s hash rate.

The blog states that this proposal may be controversial, and some in the community may have reservations toward it; however, the plan would move forward regardless. “To ensure participation and include subsidization from the whole pool of SHA-256 mining, miners will orphan BCH blocks that do not follow the plan. This is needed to avoid a tragedy of the commons,"" the post reads.","“Easy come, easy go,” Euro Pacific Capital CEO Peter Schiff joked when talking about losing all the cryptocurrency that was gifted to him after his bitcoin wallet got corrupted.

Schiff told Kitco News on the sidelines of the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference (VRIC) that “crypto was my worst investment because I lost 100%.”

At least all the cryptocurrency was gifted to Schiff. “I didn’t buy it. I got them for free. Had I bought some, that would have been even worse,” he said.

The story is that Schiff was gifted about $2,000 worth of bitcoin after Erik Voorhees opened up a wallet for him on Blockchain.com.

“Initially, I did a debate on bitcoin with Eric Voorhees at the Soho Forum. After the debate, we went out to dinner. Eric set up a wallet for me … Ironically I’ve got some [crypto] now. It was a tiny amount,” Schiff said.

After finding out that Schiff had a wallet, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Anthony Pompliano asked for the wallet ID to send Schiff $100.

“Anthony says I’ll give you some money, I said okay, here is my wallet ID … And Anthony never gave me the $100, but other people gave me about $2,000 worth. That was the entire content of my wallet,” Schiff explained.

After that, rumors began to circulate that Schiff was a secret bitcoin supporter.

“I was on the Internet the other day and someone was bringing up that I was secret bitcoin holder. So, I went to check out my wallet on my phone. And I go to log in and normally it has a keypad and I push in my numeric code. And all of a sudden, it says that I have been logged out and something is wrong and I have to log back in, but my code doesn’t work anymore,” Schiff said. “So now, my bitcoin is gone.”

“I lost all of my bitcoin. It is all gone,” he added. “Initially, [bitcoin] has no instruct value and now [it] has no market value because even if I wanted to sell it, I can’t.”

Schiff pointed out that some people think he just forgot his password, to which he replies: ""100% no.”

“I knew exactly what my password was. It was very simple. It was impossible for me to not remember it. It is just the wallet doesn’t recognize it anymore and I have no way of retrieving it. So, my bitcoin is still in that wallet, it just can’t be accessed,” he said.

The global markets company Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has seen considerable demand since launching its options contracts in the wake of the firm’s bitcoin futures. On the first day of swaps, CME’s bitcoin options saw 55 contracts ($2.3 million). By the end of the week, the firm’s bitcoin options volume more than doubled with 122 contracts ($5.3 million) sold.

CME Bitcoin Options See Steady Growth

Regulated crypto derivatives products have seen strong demand and just recently the forex marketplace CME launched options on the firm’s bitcoin futures contracts. The foreign exchange company announced its bitcoin options offering in mid-September as CME executive Tim McCourt said there was “increasing client demand” for such products. McCourt also remarked that the options would provide “clients with additional flexibility to trade and hedge their bitcoin price risk.”

Following the announcement, the ICE-owned Bakkt derivatives marketplace launched bitcoin options in the U.S., alongside opening cash-settled bitcoin futures in Asia. CME’s options started trading on January 13 and the marketplace saw a grand total of 55 options contracts or $2.3 million sold that day. As news.Bitcoin.com’s CME options report mentioned in November, each contract represents 5 BTC.

The derivatives markets researchers from Skew.com have also recorded the options action on CME since the day the products launched. “Just added CME to our bitcoin options open interest radar,” the researchers tweeted. On January 17, Skew wrote that CME’s open interest for bitcoin futures was “up 100% since the start of the year.” Following the 55 contracts on opening day, CME bitcoin options saw 122 contracts worth $5.3 million on January 17.

“[The] first week of CME options closed on a strong note with 610 bitcoin options trading on Friday,” Skew researchers noted on January 20. In addition to the strong CME options start, demand for crypto derivatives has been steadily climbing. A few days before CME launched the bitcoin options, Skew tweeted that global open interest in bitcoin derivatives has spiked 15% to roughly $3.5 billion on January 15. This includes institutional marketplaces like CME and Bakkt but also Okex, Deribit, Bitfinex, Ledgerx, FTX, Huobi, Kraken, Binance, and Bitmex.

Bakkt’s Bitcoin Options Flounder and Retail Derivatives Volumes Skyrocket

As CME records a steady climb from 55 contracts to 122 on January 17, open interest has also risen from 55 to 219. On January 21, the Twitter account Ecoinmetrics explained that Bakkt’s BTC futures were dealing with low trade volumes. “Low trading activity on the Bakkt futures,” the researchers detailed. “At the same time the Bakkt BTC options market is completely dead — Not looking very good when compared to the CME markets,” Ecoinmetrics added. With CME’s bitcoin derivatives products, the story is different. “Open interest is still high on BTC futures,” Ecoinmetrics explained the following day. “Slow increase in activity on the May’20/Jun’20 contracts after the halving — On the options side: 27 contracts traded and open interest climbing to 244 contracts.”

There were 1,039 ($9.15 million) Bakkt bitcoin monthly futures traded on Tuesday. The volume is far less than the all-time high Bakkt saw on December 18, 2019, with 6,601 physically-settled monthly futures traded. At 10:20 a.m. EST on January 22, Bakkt’s volume is around 386 BTC.

Despite the recent rise in CME-based bitcoin futures products, the volumes are still minuscule compared to the crypto derivatives giants who deal with retail customers. During the last week, Bakkt’s physically traded bitcoin futures volume has been much lighter but demand has grown since the product launched. CME and Bakkt have a long way to go before they catch up to the massive volumes Bitmex, Bitfinex, and Coinflex process on a daily basis.

Announced Wednesday, the asset manager will continue to donate one-third of the management fees from its Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust to the ETC Cooperative each quarter through 2021.

“It is a big vote of confidence which we deeply appreciate. This funding allows us to continue our support of the ETC protocol and ecosystem,” ETC Cooperative executive director Bob Summerwill said by private message. “We will provide grants for key projects, as we have through 2018 and 2019.”

Since 2017, Grayscale has donated a total of $1.1 million, including $338,000 in 2019, to the cooperative, which funds development of the protocol behind the 15th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

Grayscale manages some $80 million of assets in its ethereum classic vehicle, with nearly 10 million shares backed by about 0.92 ETC each. The trust controls about 14 percent of the total supply of ETC, based on fund disclosures and data from ETC Block Explorer. The manager charges a fee of three percent of assets under management.

The company is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.

Ethereum classic was created in 2016 as a splinter currency from ethereum (ETH) after the team leading development for the latter made a controversial decision to roll back a hacker’s transactions.

More recently, however, ETC has been building bridges with its sister chain. Recent hard forks, or system-wide upgrades, in September 2019 and January 2020 added ethereum-based updates to ethereum classic for improved interoperability.

The ethereum classic team expects to achieve “protocol parity with ETH” from a pending hard fork known as Aztlán, Summerwill said.","Source: iStock/MaFelipe

Should interest in spot trading wanes, this year will see crypto derivatives rising, with futures and options contracts taking a larger market share, estimates TokenInsight, a token data and rating agency. Also, competition for institutional clients might force exchanges to lower fees, they added.

In 2019, the volume of OKEx futures was 2.24 times the volume of spot trading; there were 238 days of BitMEX trading volume reaching more than twice that of Binance, and only 8 days of Binance spot trading volume exceeded BitMEX, the agency said in its 2019 Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange Industry Annual Report.

Source: TokenInsight

“If the spot market continues to be sluggish, it can be predicted that the total derivatives market trading volume in 2020 will grow to more than twice the spot trading volume,” they said, predicting that the competition in the derivatives products will be more intense, giving each exchange the opportunity to get more investors. However, the first to reduce fees or launch a fixed rate exchange “will be favored by the [institutional investors]” as now it's still too expensive for them.

Among the 12 derivatives exchanges studied by TokenInsight, 27 types of cryptocurrency futures contracts were listed. But the structure of the trading fees on cryptocurrency futures contracts “is obviously designed for retail investors,” says the report, providing a comparison.

According to Amber Song, an analyst at TokenInsight, exchanges might offer a special fee for institutions, while a tiered fee structure would remain.

For example, in October cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Pro, operated by major U.S.-based crypto company Coinbase, increased fees for lower-volume customers and reduced fees for high-volume customers.

Consolidation and new products

""I think that there is going to be significant consolidation of crypto derivatives in 2020. I also think that there will be increased usage of new types of derivatives--starting with options but quickly including tokenized trades,"" Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX, co-owned by Binance, was quoted as saying in the report.

He also predicts that this year, we'll see a ""small increase in derivatives markets--maybe reaching 15-20b/day of volume.""

""I'd guess that the number of traders will increase but only slightly as well and that the number of significant venues will probably decrease as the industry consolidates,"" the CEO added.

Meanwhile, Hopex Derivatives Exchange CMO, Jenny Zhang, said that “In 2020, options trading will still be in its infancy” due to technical barriers and operating costs among other reasons.

“The exchanges that complete the layout of futures trading in 2019 may begin to deploy options trading in 2020, occupying this undeveloped fertile land earlier, but this is just the beginning,” she was quoted as saying in the report.

Granted Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the patent details a payments system allowing users holding different asset types to transact with one another in real-time.

“The present technology permits a first party to pay in any currency, while permitting the second party to be paid in any currency,” reads Square’s application. The network itself can automatically exchange the sender’s payment into the asset specified by the receiver.

This new system could be especially advantageous for the retail sector, according to the filing. Many cryptocurrencies are too volatile and too slow to become an effective payments solution. Few merchants can feasibly accept a payments method that takes hours to process when the value may swing wildly.

But Square thinks it can “remove barriers” with a system that features automatic exchange and real-time settlements. Consumers can pay in their preferred asset – using a privacy coin to keep their identities secret, for example – and merchants receive the full value in an asset they want to hold.

The patent suggests the system could be extended to add support for other asset classes including securities, derivatives or loans.

Square integrated bitcoin in 2018 and Dorsey has said multiple times he believes BTC could become the “native currency” for the internet. Square has generally been reticent on other cryptocurrencies. Asked if the firm planned to add support for other digital coins, the head of the cryptocurrency team said last summer the team remained focused on bitcoin and would continue supporting its network development and mass adoption.",
2020-01-23,"BlockFi, one of the first lending startups in the cryptocurrency markets, announced Thursday it would make changes to the interest paid based on the yield it generates from lending bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). The changes begin Feb. 1.

Rates for litecoin (LTC) and Gemini dollar (GUSD) will remain unchanged, according to BlockFi.

In an email to CoinDesk, Blockfi CEO Zac Prince said the crypto market is starting to “position more bullish”, which brings yields for lending bitcoin (and ether) down.

“As market conditions change, particularly price sentiment, this has an effect on the prices in the crypto borrowing market which is a big driver of rates that BlockFi can offer to our clients,” Prince said.

Beginning Feb. 1, BlockFi will adjust the annual percentage yield (APY) for its tiered rates for two of the world’s leading cryptocurrencies. Source: BlockFi

BlockFi’s new yields for those lending up to 10 BTC (its “Tier 1” customers) will be 5.1 percent. Right now, customers loaning up to 5 BTC see a yield of 6.2 percent. Likewise, their Tier 1 ETH lenders will also see a rate cut to 3.6 percent on loans of up to 500 ETH from 4.2 percent for lending 1,000 ETH.

Announced Thursday, Switzerland-based Amun has launched the 21Shares Short Bitcoin ETP (SBTC) on the Swiss Stock Exchange (SIX), an exchange-traded product tracking bitcoin’s price movements inversely.

If bitcoin’s price climbs, traders lose. If it falls, they win.

“If you’ve ever tried trading options or futures, you’ll see that it’s pretty difficult,” Amun CEO Hany Rashwan said in a phone interview. “It’s not the easiest thing which is why it’s just easier to say ‘I think bitcoin price will go down, I’m going to buy this stock.’”

Compared to entering short trade positions on bitcoin – wherein an investor expects the price to fall and bets against an asset’s value rising by buying and selling a position on loaned funds – Amun’s Short Bitcoin ETP does not require loaned capital.

Rather, the product captures bitcoin’s price movement inversely in one stock purchase akin to a synthetic exchange-traded note (ETN) comprised of short positions. Furthermore, all positions reset at the end of the trading day with performances not rolling over to the next day.

Rashwan noted the rise of crypto derivatives, particularly from lightly or completely unregulated exchanges, which are taking up to 99 percent of the bitcoin derivative market’s volume compared to legacy providers such as CME Group or ICE’s Bakkt.

Indeed, crypto derivatives platform FTX traded some 2,405 options contracts traded on its inaugural day, Jan. 13, versus 54 options contracts on CME which opened the same day, according to financial publication Micky. Options on CME are constructed at 5 bitcoin per contract while FTX allows users to draft their own.

Responding to consumer demand, Rashwan said Amun has positioned itself to provide new forms of crypto exposure in just a few clicks.

“We hope to bring the easiest and most regulated user experience to short or leverage crypto exposure and this is the first step towards that vision… You don’t have to figure out how to open and shut the contract. You don’t need to deal with what a perpetual swap is. Nothing of that sort. You just buy a stock,” Rashwan added.","Norwegian crypto exchange Bitruption has begun offering its users access to Bitcoin SV (BSV), becoming the latest global crypto exchange to come out in support of BSV.

The move sees Bitruption join the growing number of crypto exchanges worldwide in onboarding full support for BSV, allowing users to buy and sell the cryptocurrency through their platform for the first time.

Offering support for external wallet suppliers including Money Button, Exodus and HandCash, the exchange has enabled full access to BSV trading for its users, effective immediately.

Som første regulerte aktør i Norge har vi gleden av å kunne lansere støtte for Bitcoin SV (BSV). Nå kan du kjøpe og selge Bitcoin SV direkte mot kroner (NOK). For Bitcoin SV anbefaler vi følgende wallets: Handcash, Exodus og Moneybutton. — bitruption (@bitruption) January 22, 2020

Announcing the move on Twitter, Bitruption said it was a “pleasure” to onboard support for BSV trading: “As the first regulated player in Norway, we have the pleasure of launching support for Bitcoin SV (BSV). Now you can buy and sell Bitcoin SV directly for NOK (NOK). For Bitcoin SV we recommend the following wallets: Handcash, Exodus and Moneybutton.”

The move is particularly significant given Bitruption’s status as the first regulated exchange in Norway. The decision to support BSV comes in response to demand from users of the platform.

Founded in 2018, Bitruption provides a marketplace service for individuals to buy and sell cryptocurrency through its fiat-crypto exchange platform.

The only blockchain to adhere to the original vision of Bitcoin in the Satoshi whitepaper, BSV is developing a new system of global, cost-effective payments.

At the same time, the BSV blockchain is favored by an increasing number of app developers, leveraging the full benefits of the technology to deliver more effective utility functions for the cryptocurrency.

With superior technology for developers, including sufficient block size capacity for enterprise scale microtransactions, new apps are being launched at an increasing frequency, built on and for the BSV ecosystem. From a payments perspective, BSV is favored for its low transaction costs, including for cross border payments, as well as its rapid settlement.

The launch is likely to prove popular with Bitruption users, offering unrestricted access to trade in BSV. It comes at a time of increasing interest in Bitcoin SV, both in its technology capabilities and its utility as an easy, convenient mechanism for digital payments.

Simplex already has a range of connections

BitPay facilitates the acceptance of cryptocurrencies by monitoring, validating, and confirming client transactions on each blockchain. On the merchant side, Bitpay allows clients to settle in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash and has recently added options to settle in multiple stablecoins, including Circle USDC and Gemini Dollar.

Simplex has already signed partnerships with leading crypto exchanges, including Binance and Huobi, among others, to enable users to buy cryptocurrencies with their credit cards. Most recently, it has signed mobile wallet provider Broxus to facilitate buying of bitcoin and ether directly via Telegram.

Although the exact details of the partnership were not disclosed, Simplex often charges 3.5 percent of a transaction, with a $10 minimum purchase amount. The company also applies various restrictions, including a $20,000 maximum for daily transactions when using a credit or debit card, as well as a $50,000 maximum monthly limit.

Speaking about the new partnership, a Simplex spokesman told Finance Magnates that “BitPay has made tremendous progress in their development, achieving critical mass of users that we are very happy to now service with our credit card crypto onramp service.” “I am excited to see how two crypto category leaders work together on advanced services that enhance adoption and usability,” he added.","In this video from WEF 2020, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, also known as “Crypto Dad,” discusses his push to digitize the U.S. dollar and the future of global currencies.

“We believe that the dollar usage in the global economy is underserved by serving as a continual analog instrument in a digital world,” he said. “We’re going to think through how to create a digital dollar that serves well into this coming digital century.”

Ultimately, Giancarlo feels governmental currencies will come together with corporate cryptocurrencies and, presumably, open-source communities like bitcoin and ethereum. Government crypto, said Giancarlo, might try to intrude on privacy, something that blockchain can prevent.

Platforms offering debit cards that can be topped up with cryptocurrency have enjoyed growing popularity in the crypto community. They provide a payment solution for those who earn and own digital coins, enabling in-store and online crypto payments. Their expanding user base provides a snapshot of the kind of people who spend crypto on a daily basis and what they like to buy.

Highly Educated, Overachieving Foodies

Three European companies with crypto card products shared what they know about their users with news.Bitcoin.com. Madrid-based fintech startup 2gether provides banking services to residents of the Eurozone through its mobile app. The company issues a debit Visa linked to its wallet which supports about a dozen cryptocurrencies. Major ones such as BTC, BCH, ETH, and XRP account for over 90% of the platform’s crypto payments. Its customers can spend them like they would traditional currencies and also withdraw cash at ATMs through conversion to fiat. 2gether recently released statistical data profiling its crypto card users and their spending habits.

The debit card allows holders to pay with cryptos and euros, which 37% and 63% do respectively. The everyday crypto user is a highly educated millennial male, shows the analysis of the spending behavior of more than 10,000 customers. The majority of cryptocurrency spenders, 56%, are between 26 and 45 years old and 77% of them are male. The most common professions among them are lawyers, accountants, and economists (15.64%), followed by students (11.20%), operators and transporters (9.82%), and senior executives and businessmen (8.82%), the company detailed this week.

The study covers a period from April to December 2019 and 19 Eurozone countries where the crypto card is available. It’s mostly used at restaurants and hotels (32.71%), supermarkets and grocery stores (19.13%), and to pay communication bills (11.91%) and transport expenses (11.85%). On average, users spend €112.56 worth of cryptocurrency monthly and €132.65 in fiat. “In comparison with European consumption habits based on euros, the consumption at restaurants and on food receives fourth place in the ranking, with house supplies being the first expense,” 2gether noted, quoting information from Eurostat. CEO Ramon Ferraz further commented:

It is extremely beneficial for us at 2gether to know exactly who our customer is and how they change every year. Our goal is to enable the mass adoption of cryptocurrency and enable users to spend crypto in their everyday life. This data we’ve compiled takes us one step closer to making our goal a reality in 2020.

Bitsa is another European platform striving to provide an alternative to traditional banking. It offers prepaid Visa cards linked to a mobile wallet that can be topped up with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash among other payment options. BCH, BTC, LTC, DASH, XLM, XRP, and ZEC can be deposited and converted to euros to spend the balance in stores and online. The Bitsa cards come in virtual and plastic forms and there’s also a product targeting Europe’s Generation Z, Bitsa Young, which allows parents to order a card for their children and provide them with some financial freedom thanks to crypto.

Although it issues its cards through the same partner, the Spanish regulated electronic money institution Pecunpay, Bitsa takes a different approach. The Monaco-based company tracks less card usage data and isn’t very keen on revealing what it knows for a good reason. “We don’t have it because it’s private and we take the privacy of our users very seriously,” CMO Roberta Quintiliano explained. Nevertheless, she was kind enough to pull the curtain a little bit for news.Bitcoin.com and share that the majority of Bitsa users, 74.5%, are aged between 25 and 44 years old and 75.8% are male. The majority of Bitsa card holders are people interested in technologies and mobile applications, she added.

Groceries, Fast Food, Coffee and Travel

A report on crypto card usage in Europe wouldn’t be complete without taking a look at the numbers gathered by a major player. U.K.-based Wirex has over 3 million registered users across 130 countries and has processed more than $3 billion in transactions to date. The platform allows users to spend leading cryptocurrencies such as BTC, LTC, ETH, and XRP among 10 digital coins.

Around 60% of Wirex Visa card users are millennials, aged between 18 and 37, and approximately 39% are members of Generation X, between the ages of 38 and 53 years old, revealed Amelie Arras who is responsible for PR and media communications. An analysis conducted by Wirex in 2018 showed that people choose its platform for the convenience and versatility it offers and because it allows them to pay with either regular fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.

The service lets crypto enthusiasts exchange their digital currency in-app and spend it anywhere Visa is accepted. Arras also emphasized that “This is reflected in how people use Wirex. It’s particularly suited to those who frequently travel and who therefore want a single place to manage multiple currencies and get the best market rates when exchanging them.” Grocery stores, fast food outlets, coffee shops and travel are at the top of the spending charts for Wirex cards, with a split of roughly 25% online and 75% in-store. Around 80% of account deposits are made in cryptocurrency.

The latest 2019 data available shows that 25% of all currency transactions, fiat and crypto, were recorded in the United Kingdom, followed by Italy with 13%, Spain and Germany with close to 10%, then France with 7%. Around 21% of all crypto to fiat exchanges were made in the U.K., followed by Italy with 14%, Spain and Germany with 10%, and France with 8%. At Wirex, BTC is the most traded coin, representing close to 70% of all crypto conversions, and almost 50% of all currencies, followed by the euro with 20% of all exchanges, then the British pound and ethereum – below 10%. The top five currencies frequently spent by Wirex users, historically and in 2019, are BTC, EUR, GBP, ETH and USD.

SB2594, introduced on Jan. 18 with bipartisan backing, would make it legal for Hawaiian banks to hold “digital securities,” “virtual currencies,” “digital consumer assets” and other “open blockchain tokens” for their customers. It would further authorize Hawaiian courts to hear digital asset claims.

State Senators Gil Riviere (D-23), Sharon Moriwaki (D-12), Stanley Chang (D-9), Les Ihara (D-10) and Kurt Fevella (R-19) sponsored the bill.

In effect, the bill could clear the way for Hawaiian banks to offer digital services alongside their existing ones. U.S. banks have long balked at touching bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, fearing regulatory uncertainties and the assets’ at times illicit associations could spell trouble down the line.

But the troubles go a step further in Hawaii, where even crypto-focused money services struggle to function. That’s because the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions requires crypto-licensed entities hold fiat reserves equal to their virtual currency holdings, a decision Coinbase said led to its shuttering of operations in the state in 2017.

This legislative effort does not appear to end the “double reserve” problem, as Coinbase has called it. But it would, conceivably, give some legal clarity to Hawaiian banks.

The bill’s language describes a low-cost, at times pro-consumer custodial system that could come online 60 days after passage. Banks would be required to pay a $1 annual fee and hire an independent accountant to examine their digital books.",
2020-01-24,"Iran Has a Bitcoin Strategy to Beat Trump

In narrow terms, the economic sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran in the last two years have been effective, shrinking the Iranian economy by 10 to 20 percent. But they have also accelerated Iran’s use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which are increasingly used by the Iranian government and public to evade legal barriers. This has led to an attempted crackdown on bitcoin by international regulators—but the cryptocurrency industry is proving more nimble than the enforcers of sanctions.

The Iranian government has long had an interest in using cryptocurrencies to support international trade outside of the traditional banking system. In July 2018, President Hassan Rouhani’s administration declared its intention of launching a national cryptocurrency; one month later, a news agency affiliated with the Central Bank of Iran outlined multiple features of the national cryptocurrency, stating that it would be backed by the rial—Iran’s national currency. Multiple blockchain projects—developing the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies—were revealed by the central bank at a digital payments conference last year, one of which is reportedly already being tested by four Iranian banks (three of which are under sanctions).

Cryptocurrency transactions are already popular with the Iranian public, according to various reports. In some interviews, people have described bitcoin as the only way to get money out of Iran. Cryptocurrency mining activity, which is a heavy computational process that generates, or “mines,” new cryptocurrency, is also significant in Iran. Lured by the cheap cost of electricity in the country, and the devaluation of the Iranian rial, several bitcoin miners set up operations in Iran in 2018. In 2019, a survey conducted with 1,650 Iranians using bitcoin showed that 25 percent of respondents made $500 to $3,000 per month working with cryptocurrency. The Iranian government also appears to have recognized the value in mining as an economic sector. In August 2019, after a month of harsh crackdowns on mining activity for abusing cheap electricity, the cabinet issued a regulation that recognized mining as a legal sector in the economy.

Interestingly, Iran also appears to have attracted interest from other countries willing to collaborate via blockchain platforms. In 2017, Sweden reportedly authorized a local start-up to invest in firms on the Iranian stock market by using bitcoin. In November 2018, Iranian and Russian blockchain industry personnel signed an agreement for cooperation in developing Iran’s blockchain industry, with a stated aim to address challenges arising from sanctions. In 2019, Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization conducted negotiations on the use of cryptocurrencies in financial transactions with representatives of eight countries, including Switzerland, South Africa, France, England, Russia, Austria, Germany, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 2016, as per the Iran nuclear deal, the United Nations and European Union lifted sanctions on Iran. The EU recently launched Instex, a transactions channel between Europe and Iran.

Multiple obstacles still exist, however, before Iran can fully harness the power of cryptocurrencies. The room for anonymity is steadily shrinking for cryptocurrency transactions as formal identification of customers through “know your customer” (KYC) compliance rises globally. In 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control added two Iranian individuals and their bitcoin addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals List. According to forensic analysis by the Treasury Department, more than 7,000 bitcoin transactions valuing millions of dollars had been processed by these addresses. Apart from other criminal activity such as the Silk Road case and numerous scams, cryptocurrency usage by regimes such as Venezuela and Iran has been one of the driving factors for heavy regulation of the sector.

Apart from country-specific regulations that mandate financial compliance, the Financial Action Task Force’s standards were set in 2019 and are now enforced across 37 member countries. These standards impose full KYC compliance at the level of virtual asset service providers, as well as a “travel rule” that requires both originators and beneficiaries of cryptocurrency transactions to identify and report suspicious information. These regulations effectively exclude Iran from major cryptocurrency exchanges. This has tilted the Iranian cryptomarket toward local exchanges, where price premiums on the currency are higher. Iran is thus losing out on its competitiveness in mining compared with other jurisdictions. While electricity costs are lower, other costs related to mining, such as hardware and operations, are much higher in Iran. Meanwhile, there is still regulatory uncertainty over the future of cryptocurrency within Iran.

Despite these challenges, there are new developments in the world of cryptocurrency that may open up new possibilities for the Iranian government and people to evade sanctions. One significant development is the rise of central bank digital currencies, which are the governmental take on cryptocurrencies—central banks issuing natively digital money. China and Russia have notably been working on these projects for some time, and the Chinese sovereign coin, or “digital yuan,” is expected to be launched this year. The implications for international sanctions are vast. First, these projects inevitably run on private blockchains that provide no traceability to outside countries the way a bitcoin network does. The second is that these instruments are completely outside the purview of current U.S.-led global financial architecture. Countries that are still open to cooperating with Iran could easily explore avenues through the use of such sovereign coins.

Another more significant industry-led development is decentralized finance. Popularly referred to as “DeFi,” this rising class of cryptocurrency projects aims to provide traditional financial services such as banking, lending, and trading over decentralized networks and without intermediaries. These expand significantly on the financial options available for ordinary citizens to services beyond just payments, which is what bitcoin currently offers. For example, Iran has been facing record-high inflation since 2019, but by using DeFi, Iranians can borrow from global markets at rates much lower than those inside Iran. Leveraging decentralized exchanges can also help the regime convert cryptocurrencies to fiat through channels that cannot be effectively controlled by outside regulators. The decentralized nature of these platforms makes them difficult to regulate as effectively as centralized exchanges.

DeFi still offers challenges for would-be sanctions evaders. These channels cannot offer very high liquidity as compared with large centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The entire outstanding market cap for DeFi is estimated at around $430 million, and handling trades of $10 million to $20 million becomes challenging through these platforms. The Iranian regime might also deter access to DeFi for citizens by imposing harsh punishment, as it can pose a significant capital flight risk for the economy. On the industry side, the DeFi community leans heavily toward transparency, and all transactions are recorded in a blockchain, which can be subject to forensic analyses similar to bitcoin. Most service providers additionally undertake significant checks from their side to limit illicit activity through their platforms and avoid regulatory noncompliance.

Iran has clearly understood that cryptocurrencies are among the ways to challenge and subvert the U.S.-dominated financial architecture. Closing off these channels effectively will take global coordination and cooperation with cryptocurrency service providers; both global and Iranian regulations will determine the degree of access to these avenues. In the meantime, as long as holes in regulation exist, they are sure to be exploited by the Iranian regime and people.","A recent federal criminal action shows the depth of the U.S. government’s concern about the use of cryptocurrency (or virtual currency) to violate economic sanctions laws and the lengths to which it will go to charge such violations. The U.S. government is particularly concerned that sanctioned countries and parties have used cryptocurrency to avoid sanctions designed to isolate them, and to facilitate illicit activities, including money laundering and ransomware attacks. The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department (OFAC), which administers U.S. economic sanctions programs, indicated recently that it intends to devote more resources to cryptocurrency issues. Over the past year or so, OFAC has issued a number of subpoenas to virtual currency businesses, such as exchanges, regarding possible customers and transactions involving parties in sanctioned countries. OFAC will probably announce its first enforcement actions involving virtual currency at some point this year. In addition, as discussed in Orrick’s recent blog post, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission remain focused on AML risks presented by cryptocurrency.

In an unusual application of economic sanctions law, in November 2019 a U.S. citizen was arrested and charged by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York with violating U.S. sanctions after he traveled to North Korea and delivered a presentation and technical advice related to the use of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. In the case, which did not involve cryptocurrency transactions, the U.S. Attorney charged Virgil Griffith, an Ethereum Foundation staff member, with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions laws that generally prohibit the provision of unlicensed services to North Korea. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Mr. Griffith had traveled to North Korea to attend and speak at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference, despite the U.S. government’s denial of his request for authorization to attend. The U.S. government alleges that at the conference Mr. Griffith and other attendees discussed how North Korea could use blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to launder money and evade sanctions.

OFAC has issued frequently asked questions emphasizing that compliance obligations remain the same regardless whether transactions are denominated in virtual currency or fiat, and has started to include in its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) virtual currency addresses that are linked to sanctioned persons. Sanctions are enforced with the help of U.S. businesses, in particular banks and other financial institutions, which have implemented systems and internal controls to detect the involvement of designated persons or prohibited jurisdictions in transactions. The U.S. government expects a similar level of commitment from entities dealing in cryptocurrency. It is critical that U.S. virtual currency users, exchangers, administrators and other persons engaging in virtual currency transactions with any U.S. nexus take steps designed to ensure that they do not deal with U.S. sanctions targets, which include providing financial or other services to such parties. OFAC has advised technology companies, administrators, exchangers, and users of virtual currencies, and other payment processors, to implement risk-based compliance programs, which generally should include sanctions list screening. This is consistent with OFAC’s recommendations included in A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments issued in June 2019.

Because a strict liability standard applies to unauthorized dealings with sanctioned parties and jurisdictions, U.S. persons dealing in cryptocurrency cannot avoid potential liability simply because they do not know the identity of the person with whom they are interacting. And the risk of dealing with sanctioned persons and jurisdictions when conducting virtual currency transactions will likely increase should nations like Iran and Russia further embrace cryptocurrency to try to avoid sanctions. In 2018, Iran reportedly acknowledged cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate industry, and in December 2019, Iran’s President reportedly proposed creation of a Muslim cryptocurrency to decrease reliance on the U.S. dollar. The U.S. government acted in 2018 to prohibit transactions involving Venezuela’s state virtual currency, the “Petro.”

To protect against potential sanctions violations, there are key steps that cryptocurrency users and exchanges can take. Crypto exchanges operating in the United States are required to register with FinCEN as money services businesses, to license themselves in the states in which they operate, and to exclude users in sanctioned jurisdictions and those on OFAC’s SDN List from transacting on the exchange. These exchanges should adopt and implement Know Your Customer procedures, including sanctions screening, to identify parties trading on their exchanges, and can employ geo-IP blocking to prohibit access by parties from sanctioned jurisdictions. They should perform transaction monitoring to detect suspicious activity and file required reports with FinCEN. U.S. persons trading in cryptocurrency should use exchanges committed to complying with U.S. sanctions requirements. If the exchange allows sanctioned parties to participate, a U.S. person could end up unknowingly trading with such a party and thus violating U.S. law. Exchanges operating outside the United States that want to attract U.S. users should also consider implementing such measures, to exclude targets of U.S. sanctions from trading. Non-U.S. exchanges that permit access to certain U.S. sanctions targets may risk imposition of U.S. “secondary sanctions” designed to deter non-U.S. persons from engaging in business with targets of U.S. sanctions.","Independent Reserve, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in Australia, is expanding to Singapore after an “overwhelmingly positive” response from the regulator.

Adrian Przelozny, CEO and founder of the Sydney-based exchange, announced Friday it had expanded its trading services to users in Singapore, saying in a statement that his team “felt the time was right to make this move.”

Przelozny referenced “a number of positive moves by Singaporean regulators” as part of his reasoning.

Independent Reserve offers a host of retail and institutional trading features, including a spot marketplace and over-the-counter (OTC) service. The exchange introduced insurance coverage against theft or loss of digital assets held in a client’s account in February 2019.

Established in 2013, Independent Reserve claims it has more than 120,000 customers and 8,000 self-managed super funds (SMSFs), a private superannuation fund operated by its members and regulated by Australian law.

Singapore adopted an open-arms approach to cryptocurrency regulation when the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s de facto central bank and financial regulator, created a legal framework – the 2019 Payment Services Act – that effectively brought all cryptocurrency payments providers under its jurisdiction.

The Payments Services Act was one of the main factors that influenced the Independent Reserve’s decision to move to Singapore, according to Przelozny.

“Having worked closely with Australian regulators, and as the only Australian exchange to have insurance on crypto assets, the response we’ve received so far from the Singapore market has been overwhelmingly positive,” Przelozny said.

A number of other exchanges, attracted to Singapore’s regulatory regime, have also expressed an interest in moving to the country. Binance announced plans to set up a new fiat-to-crypto exchange in the country last year. A group of ex-Morgan Stanley bankers launched a crypto derivatives exchange in December after MAS published a proposal to regulate these types of financial products.","San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase is reportedly holding nearly 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) in its cold storage wallets. While digital currency exchanges have been known to fake trading volume, it appears that the amount of funds held in offline storage provides a better picture.

Coinbase is currently holding 983,706.78 BTC, or presently over $8.4 billion, in its cold wallets. Digital asset exchange Huobi has climbed from the fifth spot to second-place this year with almost 360,000 BTC residing in its offline wallets.

Coinbase continues to custody the largest amount of BTC

An analysis of on-chain transactions has been used to determine the amount of Bitcoin held by each exchange. While these figures might not account for all cold wallet addresses, they most likely give us reasonably accurate estimates.

Chain.info data confirms that Coinbase continues to custody the largest amount of Bitcoin. The leading crypto-asset exchange also has the highest number of BTC addresses at 2,057,510.

The trading platform’s Bitcoin holdings have increased significantly during the past year. Despite fluctuations in the BTC price, the majority of Coinbase users continued to accumulate Bitcoin throughout 2019.

The substantial increase in BTC holdings might be due to Coinbase’s institutional traders, who could be planning to make long-term investments, without reacting to short-term price fluctuations.

Malta-based Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, managed to maintain its second position for the majority of 2019. However, it has now fallen to the third position on Chain.info’s list. Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex is currently ranked fourth and holds over 192,000 Bitcoins.

PlusToken scammers may have sold large quantities of BTC on Huobi

Bitstamp, Kraken, and Bittrex occupy the sixth, seventh, and eighth positions respectively and have held roughly the same amount of BTC throughout 2019.

Coin Metrics data revealed last year that large amounts of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) were sold on Huobi by the PlusToken scammers, who orchestrated a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme by targeting Chinese investors. Chainalysis also managed to trace transactions related to the PlusToken coins to several large over the counter desks.

The native tokens of several major exchanges including Binance’s BNB, OKEx’s OKB, and Huobi’s HT token had a strong Q1 2019 performance against Bitcoin, registering more than 100 percent gains against the flagship cryptocurrency. But toward the end of last year, most of these gains had been lost.

Cold wallet BTC holdings and exchange token prices of Huobi and OKEx experienced a substantial increase, meanwhile, Binance and Bitfinex’s token prices remained fairly flat, indicating that there could be some correlation between BTC and these native exchange coins.

Let’s talk a bit about growth and potential. The two are not always the same thing, but they both are vital for successful investing. The aim of all stock investments, after all, is to achieve growth – and that means finding stocks with the highest potential. It’s natural to gravitate toward the headline-grabbing, big-name giants; they’ve got huge market valuations, and have made their early investors very happy. But there’s an unfortunate truism in the markets, based on the iron rules of mathematics, that the larger a company gets, the less likely it is to show big returns. It’s far more likely for a $200 million company to double in value than for a $200 billion giant. And this brings us to the small-cap stocks. For investors seeking the best combination of high potential for growth and low cost of entry, the small caps may be just the ticket. We’ve used the TipRanks database to find several that fit a profile: a market cap under $400 million and a share price below $10. Even better, these small-cap tickers have Strong Buy consensus ratings from the analyst community, and boast strong upside potential. PowerFleet, Inc. (PWFL) The Internet of Things is transforming a host of industries, from factory floors to warehouses to trucking fleets. PowerFleet, the first small-cap stock we’re looking at, applies IoT and M2M tech to the security, control, tracking, and management of high-end assets, including tractor-trailers, containers, industrial trucks, and cargo, vehicle, and truck fleets. PowerFleet’s 1Q revenue was consistent with the previous quarter, and included an improvement in earnings. At the top line, the reported revenue of $29 million was only 1.3% off of Q4’s result. The 9-cent EPS loss reported was a 25% improvement from the 12-cent loss reported in the previous quarter. Year-over-year, EPS improved by 40%. Earlier this month, PowerFleet scored two major new contracts. On May 10, the company announced a 4-year contract with the Israel Police for implantation of a fleet management and driver solution system for more than 7,500 vehicles of 61 different types. The contract includes an option for a 4-year renewal. Two days later, PowerFleet announced a smaller deal with Alabama-based White Oak Transportation, to supply tracking services for the trucking company’s fleet of 850 vehicles, especially its cargo trailers. Covering PowerFleet for Canaccord, 5-star analyst Michael Walkley sees a clear path ahead for the company's continued growth. “With 600K+ subscribers, PowerFleet has the scale and international footprint to compete for global tenders against leading fleet and asset tracking competitors. For fleet management, PowerFleet is one of the only true end-to-end solutions in the market spanning in-cab, refrigerated trailers, dry vans, and containers,"" Walkley opined. The analyst added, ""We believe PowerFleet has a strong product portfolio and a leading solutions platform to grow its market share. This strength is demonstrated by its expansive global customer base… We believe PowerFleet has the leadership team in place to execute on its growth strategy and anticipate recovering sales and expanding margins as global economies recover.” To this end, Walkley rates PWFL a Buy, and his $12 price target implies a one-year upside of 84%. (To watch Walkley’s track record, click here) Overall, the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating here, based on 4 recent positive reviews, shows that Wall Street agrees with Walkley on this stock. The shares are trading for $6.51, and the average price target of $11.13 indicates a potential upside of 71% for the next 12 months. (See PWFL stock analysis on TipRanks) AXT, Inc. (AXTI) AXT is a material science company that inhabits the supply chain for the semiconductor industry. AXT develops and manufactures the high-performance rare-metal substrate wafers necessary in the construction of semiconductor chips and optoelectronic devices. AXT has operations in both California and China, staying close to Silicon Valley customers and Chinese raw materials. The company holds a vital niche in the chip industry, and its revenue and earnings have been reflecting that. In the first quarter of 2021, revenue hit $31.4 million, passing the $30 million mark for the first time on 51% year-over-year growth. EPS hit 8 cents, a dramatic turnaround from the 1-cent loss reported in the year-ago quarter. Along with the Q1 results, AXT also announced its first deliveries of 8-inch diameter gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates to a major customer. AXT has received ‘significant interest’ from potential customers of GaAs products, and predicts increasing demand as the products finds more applications. Analyst Richard Shannon, covering this stock for Craig-Hallum, takes especial note of the increasing demand for the company’s products. “The demand profile from InP (optics, health monitoring) and GaAs (5G, optics, 3DS, microLED) are as powerful as any we can find across small-cap tech. With an improving customer set (tier 1’s driving much of future growth), GM that can still grow and valuation improvement potential from a STAR exchange listing in mid-2022, investors have multiple ways to win in this stock,"" Shannon wrote. Shannon’s bullish comments back up his Buy rating, and his $17 price target suggests a 90% growth potential in the year ahead. (To watch Shannon’s track record, click here) The Wall Street reviews on AXTI break down 3 to 1 in favor of Buys versus Holds, giving the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in AXTI are selling for $8.95 each, and the average target of $16 indicates a possible upside of ~79% from that level. (See AXTI stock analysis on TipRanks) CECO Environmental (CECE) For the last stock on our list, we’ll shift to the green economy, where CECO Environmental develops, provides, and install air quality and fluid handling systems. In short, the company deals in air pollution control technology, a niche that has been in demand since the 1970s. CECO provides know-how and systems in a wide range of industries, including construction materials like bricks, cement, steel, and glass; and manufacturing, in the automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical, chemical, and fuel refining sectors. In the company’s most recent financial release, for 1Q21, the top line came in at $71.9 million, just under the $80.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter, while EPS fell from 10 cents per share one year ago to 3 cents in the current report. In more positive notes, the company reported a year-over-year increase in bookings, from $75.7 million to $92.1 million, and the work backlog of $203.1 million was up 11% from one year ago. A few days after the earnings release, CECO announced that it had won a large-scale contract with a major semiconductor chip manufacturer. The chip industry regularly works with a variety of rare metals and other pollutant chemicals – and CECO’s new contract covers scrubber and exhaust systems, as well as recirculation pumps -- items necessary for the chip maker to meet or exceed environmental regulations. Turning to the analyst community, H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal believes the company has a lot going for it and a bright future. “The company appears to be in recovery from COVID-19 headwinds, with bookings growing to $92.1M during the quarter... The last time bookings were at or above these levels was during mid-2019…. During the next few quarters, we expect to see improved revenues from Engineered Systems as the broader energy markets improve. Management highlighted that the company's bid proposal environment has been improving, with order pipeline of over $2.0B, which we believe should support continuing order improvement over the next few quarters,” the 5-star analyst explained. Based on the above, Dayal rates CECE shares a Buy rating, and his $15 price target indicates confidence in a 100% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here) Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating – this one based on 3 positive Wall Street reviews. The shares are selling for $7.50 and have a $12 average price target, suggesting a 12-month upside of 60%.

2020-01-25,"In order to make any profit from cryptocurrencies, traders need to know how to get the best price when selling their holdings.

If you’ve ever found yourself asking “How much should I sell?” or “When should I sell?”, this article will hopefully help you find some answers.

You’ll learn how to control your emotions, set price levels to sell your Bitcoin and altcoins, and what percentage of your portfolio you should sell at what prices.

My aim in this article is to show you how to create a long-term trading strategy that will maximise your ROI while maintaining over 20% of your total cryptocurrency holdings.

As always, the views in this article should not be considered financial advisement. The volatility of the crypto markets means money can easily be lost. Never invest more than you can afford to lose and always do your own due diligence.

Finding the next Bitcoin peak

Above we can see the BraveNewCoin Liquid Index future price chart for Bitcoin, courtesy of user daanafgaan on TradingView.

The chart shows the different trend phases in Bitcoin’s price history and uses these trends to calculate when we’re likely to hit another bull market.

While nobody can accurately predict what Bitcoin will do in the future thanks to the volatility of the market and potential unforeseen black-swan events, looking at historical data can at least provide some insight into potential movements and therefore when might be a good time to sell.

According to the chart, there’s usually an initial bull run followed by a price top that ends with a +50% drop. Afterwards, there’s a long accumulation period followed by a new bull run.

Each bull run coincides with the Bitcoin supply halving. If you’re wondering whether halvings are priced in, this chart clearly shows they’re not.

Otherwise, why would BTC always find a new top a few months after the halving event? Historically, massive profits can only be achieved after each halving, not before.

The chart predicts that the next BTC peak will be over $200,000 sometime in 2021, indicating the best time to sell would be after a potential post-halving bull run.

At what price should you sell?

The sooner you start selling, the faster you realise some ROI. However, remember that the later you start selling, the more profit you’ll earn per transaction.

It’s important to play around with these two concepts when setting your selling price levels.

If we’re to assume the price of Bitcoin will hit $200,000, some potential sell targets would be between $100,000 to $200,000.

If you want to be a bit more cautious, you could follow the example below and start selling sooner, for example around $50,000.

To maximise your profits, you should know what percentage of your portfolio to sell and what percentage to keep.

After all, nobody can time the markets perfectly.

How much should you sell?

To understand how much you should sell, you should ask yourself, “How much Bitcoin am I ready to part with?”

If you’re in it for the money, perhaps you want to sell close to 100% of your cryptocurrency stack.

If you’re a hardcore believer in the future of cryptocurrency, you may want to keep at least 50% of your portfolio in BTC and other altcoins. Perhaps more.

My personal aim is to follow a doubling logic. Let me explain with a straightforward example.

Let’s say you bought 1 BTC in the past few years at about $10,000. In addition, you’re looking to sell between $50,000 and $200,000. What would your profits and ROI be?

The selling matrix

Percentage sold Bitcoin price Bitcoin sold Revenue per transaction Cumulative BTC sold Cumulative revenue 1.00% USD 50,000.00 0.01 USD 500.00 0.01 USD 500.00 2.00% USD 60,000.00 0.02 USD 1,200.00 0.03 USD 1,700.00 3.00% USD 70,000.00 0.03 USD 2,100.00 0.06 USD 3,800.00 4.00% USD 80,000.00 0.04 USD 3,200.00 0.10 USD 7,000.00 5.00% USD 90,000.00 0.05 USD 4,500.00 0.15 USD 11,500.00 6.00% USD 120,000.00 0.06 USD 7,200.00 0.21 USD 18,700.00 7.00% USD 140,000.00 0.07 USD 9,800.00 0.28 USD 28,500.00 8.00% USD 160,000.00 0.08 USD 12,800.00 0.36 USD 41,300.00 9.00% USD 180,000.00 0.09 USD 16,200.00 0.45 USD 57,500.00 10.00% USD 200,000.00 0.10 USD 20,000.00 0.55 USD 77,500.00 11.00% USD 220,000.00 0.11 USD 24,200.00 0.66 USD 101,700.00 12.00% USD 240,000.00 0.12 USD 28,800.00 0.78 USD 130,500.00

The table above is a personalised selling matrix based on the parameters described in the previous sections.

The results show you could end up with a cumulative profit of over $130,000 by selling 0.78 BTC. Percentage-wise, that would represent a 1,300% ROI on your initial $10,000 investment.

Moreover, you would still own 0.22 BTC, or 22% of your initial portfolio. This means you can either keep the cryptocurrency or adopt the same strategy for your remaining stack.

As mentioned earlier, this scenario is purely hypothetical, but I hope this article has helped you in your cryptocurrency selling endeavours. Never forget, maximising your profits means not putting all your eggs in one basket.

Safe trades!

Crypto Valley, a fintech-friendly region centered on the canton of Zug, has been expanding to other parts of Switzerland and neighboring Liechtenstein. Despite all the challenges facing the blockchain industry, favorable regulations and improving access to banking and legal services are attracting more and more crypto companies. Their number has increased for a third consecutive year and many new jobs have been created.

More Than 800 Crypto Firms Based in Switzerland and Liechtenstein

Almost 100 new businesses established a presence in the Swiss Crypto Valley last year, shows a new study. Its findings were released during the CV Summit in Davos on Thursday, a blockchain-focused event that takes place during the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. The total number of companies working with digital assets and blockchain technologies in the Crypto Valley has reached 842, the survey reveals, compared to 750 in its last year’s edition. Jobs in the sector have also increased substantially – from 3,300 in 2018 to 4,400 by the end of 2019, the Swissinfo news portal reported.

The news comes despite a slowing growth rate across the industry, a trend that started after the boom of 2017 and continued into the first half of 2018. The number of “startup casualties,” the outlet notes, is also mounting. Failed projects include crypto company Alethena, tokenization platform Tend, real estate startup Swiss Real Coin, alternative banking project Oyoba, and digital payment provider Monetas. Some of these companies simply failed to persuade investors as to the viability of their business plans.

At the same time, funding for the top 50 entities in the report reached $4 billion and these are valued at a total of $25.3 billion. Among the newly established or relocating members of the industry added to the 2019 list are Facebook’s Libra, blockchain developer Casper Labs which moved to Switzerland, crypto exchange Bittrex Global which set up an office in Liechtenstein, Six Group’s digital exchange initiative SDX, licensed crypto banks SEBA and Sygnum. The last two companies, along with Bitcoin Suisse which also expects approval to become a bank, are leading employers as well.

Established Startups Attract More Venture Capital Funding

The Crypto Valley is home to five unicorns, or projects valued at more than $1 billion. These are Ethereum ($14.4B), Dfinity ($2B), Polkadot ($1.2B), Bitmain ($1B), and Libra ($1B). Another list names unicorn contenders like Tezos ($924M), Cardano ($869M), and Cosmos ($818M). The authors of the analysis, Swiss business incubator Crypto Valley Venture Capital (CVVC), PwC subsidiary Strategy& and other organizations, point out that “the report highlights the diverse ecosystem in blockchain and cryptocurrency consisting of startups, corporates, and government” as well as its “maturity and substance.” Mature startups that are at later, more advanced stages of their lifespan typically attract more venture capital funding, which has generally increased in the past few years.

A positive development in that respect is the gradual opening of the banking sector that comes with increasing regulatory certainty. While large banks and central banks recognize the potential of crypto-related technologies, they often create difficulties for crypto businesses. Smaller financial institutions, however, are more likely to engage with the industry. Swiss banks involved in the crypto space include Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, Maerki Baumann, and Arab Bank (Switzerland). “With regulatory certainty in Crypto Valley, private banks have been leading the adoption and provision of services,” the researchers note. Access to legal services has also improved markedly with an ever expanding number of law firms offering advice to crypto companies in both Switzerland and Liechtenstein. More than two dozen of them have been listed in the report.

During the summit, CVVC CEO Mathias Ruch noted the increased interest from large Chinese banks, government agencies and investors in Swiss blockchain know-how. Last year, Switzerland introduced broad changes to its existing laws in order to incorporate rules for the crypto space while Liechtenstein adopted a new Blockchain Act meant to attract crypto businesses by providing more regulatory clarity. This progress has led to the formation of multiple crypto hotspots – not only Zug, which is home to over half of all companies based in the Crypto Valley (425), but also Zurich, Geneva, Ticino, Vaud, Lucerne, and Bern. Liechtenstein has 80 registered blockchain businesses in its jurisdiction.

The Iranian government has reportedly issued more than 1,000 licenses for cryptocurrency mining since it began regulating the industry. A number of large mining farms have set up in the country, but high electricity tariffs have kept many small investors away.

Also read: Regulatory Roundup — New US Crypto Tax Bill, Central Banks Join Forces on Digital Currencies

1,000+ Licenses Granted to Miners

An official with Iran’s ICT Guild Organization, Amir Hossein Saeedi Naeini, has revealed the state of the country’s cryptocurrency mining industry, the Financial Tribune reported Friday. In an interview with Ibena publication, he said that cryptocurrency mining is a new industry but many people have been attracted to it in Iran. Noting that miners need to obtain a license, he shared:

The Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade has issued more than 1,000 licenses for cryptocurrency mining in the country.

The official further elaborated, “Our studies show that the crypto mining industry has the potential to add $8.5 billion to the economy,” the news outlet detailed.

Major Challenge – Electricity Cost

Amir Hossein Saeedi Naeini believes that the cryptocurrency mining industry has the potential to help the Iranian economy. However, he explained that the cost of electricity is a major challenge for crypto miners in Iran. While “A number of large and industrial farming mines have been set up,” the official told the news outlet:

High electricity tariffs plus stringent regulations have made the sector less appealing for small investors.

He opined, “the operating conditions in this industry should not be such that only large capitalists enter the cryptocurrency mining market but that all miners can operate,” emphasizing that modifying the electricity rates and terms could boost the crypto mining industry and generate more revenue.

Iranian Crypto Mining Law

Iran’s cryptocurrency mining industry has been regulated since last year. The Iranian government officially recognized cryptocurrency mining as an industry in August after months of deliberation, Aljazeera reported on Aug. 4, 2019. Crypto miners must be licensed by the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade before beginning their operations.

The recognition of the industry followed a crackdown by various government authorities on crypto miners accused of using subsidized power. In June last year, Iran’s state television reported that the authorities seized approximately 1,000 bitcoin mining machines in two abandoned factories allegedly using government-subsidized electricity. A spokesperson for the country’s Energy Ministry said at the time that these mining machines were responsible for a 7% increase in power consumption.

“The electricity price offered to miners will be equal to the average rial price at which Iran exports its electricity to other nations, or to 70% of the average rial price at which the country ships off its natural gas,” the news outlet explained. Furthermore, the cabinet’s directive states that “Using electricity or natural gas to mine cryptocurrencies is forbidden in peak consumption times,” and calls for the ministry to set peak hours and install a grid of smart power meters. In addition, “using electricity and gas provided at household, agricultural or industrial grades is forbidden and will be met with legal action if found out,” the directive adds.

However, Amir Hossein Saeedi Naeini told Ibena that discussions are underway to set more favorable terms for crypto miners. Meanwhile, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has been discussing creating a unified cryptocurrency for Muslim countries with leaders of other Muslim nations.

Switzerland’s principal stock exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange, now has 12 cryptocurrency exchange-traded products listed. The latest addition, the 21shares Short Bitcoin, allows investors to profit from falling prices of the digital currency. Other listed crypto products include those that track the price movements of BCH, BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, and tezos.

Newest Addition: An Inverse Product

SIX Swiss Exchange has listed an inverse bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) issued by fintech company Amun AG. The company announced on Thursday that this product “is the first short or inverse product of its kind using a digital asset as the underlying for an ETP structure.”

The product “tracks the opposite performance of bitcoin to give investors an easy, cost-effective and convenient way to gain exposure in both directions of the bitcoin price movements,” the company detailed. It is “designed to enable investors to profit from falling adverse price movements of bitcoin.” According to the announcement:

The 21shares Short Bitcoin ETP (Ticker: SBTC) seeks to provide a -1x return to the performance of bitcoin for a single day. This product obtains short exposure through borrowing bitcoin and simultaneously selling it on an execution platform.

According to SIX Swiss Exchange’s website, the 21shares Short Bitcoin ETP started trading on Jan. 22. It is rebalanced daily, resetting at the end of each day, and its performance is not rolled over.

12 ETPs Listed on Leading Swiss Stock Exchange

SIX Swiss Exchange has a range of crypto ETPs listed. The first one was the Amun Crypto Basket Index ETP in USD, which began trading on Nov. 21, 2018.

The exchange then listed 10 more ETPs in 2019, nine of which were issued by Amun. They are Crypto Basket Index, Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, Binance, Tezos, Bitcoin Suisse Index, Bitwise 10, and Sygnum Platform Winners Index — all trade in USD, except the Amun Bitcoin Suisse Index which trades in CHF. The 10th ETP launched on SIX Swiss Exchange last year was Wisdomtree Bitcoin in USD.

This year, besides the aforementioned inverse bitcoin ETP, the leading Swiss stock exchange began offering several existing Amun ETPs in additional currencies. On Jan. 7, the Amun Bitcoin ETP and the Amun Ethereum ETP started trading in both CHF and EUR in addition to USD. On the same day, the Amun Crypto Basket Index ETP started trading in EUR, with the Amun Crypto Basket Index as the underlying investment. According to Amun, all of its crypto ETPs are listed on SIX Swiss Exchange, BX Swiss and Boerse Stuttgart in CHF, USD and EUR.

Amun further explained in its Thursday announcement that “21shares” now represents the new name of all ETPs it issues. The 11 existing ones will be migrated over to the new brand during the second quarter of this year. Moreover, the company’s base prospectus for exchange-traded products has recently been approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.

Then, just days after Christmas, nearly $90,000 worth of Bitcoin was emptied from the 60-year-old's account by cybercrooks, he says.

“Imagine waking up one day and almost everything you have is gone,” says Luksic, who previously worked in sales. “How can I lose everything I own?” He hasn't been made whole and, after talking with investigators, is pessimistic about ever recovering the money.

Luksic says he was a victim of SIM swapping, a cybersecurity attack where criminals steal a person's phone number.

Knowing where your money has guaranteed protection and where it doesn't is complicated in today's digital age, a time when Americans keep savings and investments in places beyond banks and pension funds.

Tax scams 2020:That letter from the IRS could be a fake

Generation war:When it comes to hiring, millennials are killing it

If money is stolen from a crypto account, the way Luksic's was, recouping the funds is more difficult than it would be if it were snatched from a traditional bank account, according to Philip Martin, chief information security officer of Coinbase, the Bitcoin exchange where Luksic kept his money.

""Once that money is off our platform, if it goes to an infrastructure that we can work with — we will,"" Martin says, referring to other cryptocurrency exchanges. But oftentimes, he cautions, ""law enforcement ends up being better suited to track criminals and make customers whole.""

The FBI is the lead federal agency for investigating cyberattacks that involve significant losses from fraud. The FBI said it ""can’t confirm or deny"" that there's an investigation into Luksic's case.

Luksic says he's spoken with an attorney and is seeking to file a lawsuit.

A Wisconsin woman recently ran into a similar issue when $72,000 was stolen from her 401(k) account by cybercrooks. She eventually got it back, but the mutual fund company that held her money wasn’t immediately able to guarantee that she’d ever see it again, a shock to her.

Retirement readiness:Here's the grade most Americans give themselves

If a checking or savings account is hacked, banks typically cover those losses. Financial institutions can buy insurance to protect against cyberfraud. Still, savers may have to jump through some hoops to get their money back. A bank could claim that a customer failed to take proper precautions, giving out their password or clicking on a phishing email, for example, and they may not be reimbursed.

“If you are victimized through cybertheft by no fault of your own, most large banks will make you whole,” says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.

As more cybertheft happens, “we’re likely going to see something similar to credit cards, where financial institutions are going to need to have a policy in place that assures customers are protected from fraudulent activity,"" he says, referring to banking and retirement accounts like the one belonging to the Wisconsin woman.

To prevent theft, cybersecurity professionals urge customers to create strong passwords, exercise caution with unsecured public Wi-Fi, maintain antivirus software and monitor bank and investment accounts closely.If a third party still gains access to an account, contact the bank and local law enforcement, who have jurisdiction over this type of theft, experts advise.

What’s insured?

The FDIC, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., was created during the Great Depression to protect bank accounts. It only insures deposits in banks. It doesn’t insure investments. And there’s a catch: The FDIC is required to make an account holders' money available only if an insured institution fails.

FDIC insurance covers:

Checking accounts

Savings accounts

Money market deposit accounts

Certificates of deposit

Official items issued by a bank (such as cashier's checks or money orders)

Individual retirement accounts, or IRAs

All of these types of accounts generally are insured by the FDIC up to the legal limit of $250,000. Four categories are insured separately, including individual, joint, self-directed retirement deposit accounts and trusts for beneficiaries.

What’s not insured?

The FDIC, however, doesn’t insure investments like mutual funds, annuities, stocks, bonds or securities that banks may offer. Financial institutions are supposed to disclose that non-deposit items like investments aren’t insured, according to the FDIC.

The FDIC doesn’t insure these non-deposit investments:

Annuities

Mutual funds

Stocks

Bonds

Government securities

Municipal securities

The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, or SIPC, protects customers in the event that a brokerage firm financially fails. There’s a protection limit of $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum also aren't insured by the FDIC.

Bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase have insurance that covers loss or theft from a hack on their entire system, but not hacks on individual accounts. Some Coinbase funds that are held as dollars in bank accounts are also insured by the FDIC.","We all know the IRS is very slow with respect to addressing modern-day technology and basically anything that makes our lives as taxpayers “simple.” But with the 2019 tax season quickly upon us, the IRS recently announced January 27 as the official date for accepting tax returns for the 2019 reporting period.

However, for digital money or cryptocurrency holders, this year is one to pay attention to, because the IRS finally has something to say about it with respect to how you report your holdings.

For the first time since 2014, the IRS has issued new cryptocurrency tax guidance in the form of a complete cryptocurrency FAQ and an official Revenue Ruling: 2019-24.

How is “Virtual Currency” Treated for Federal Income Tax Purposes?

Back in 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014-21, 2014-16 I.R.B. 938, explaining that virtual currency is treated as property for Federal income tax purposes and providing examples of how longstanding tax principles applicable to transactions involving property apply to virtual currency.

This year’s new Revenue Ruling expands upon the 2014-21 examples and apply those same longstanding tax principles to additional situations.

Understandably, many are dreading the process of gathering records for years of trading across multiple exchanges. But, if you’re one of those traders it’s not all bad news.

The New 1040 Schedule 1 Form

This year’s new 1040 Schedule 1 form now has a question regarding your cryptocurrency ownership, forcing crypto traders throughout the U.S. to report their cryptocurrency transactions for the very first time.

The IRS defines “cryptocurrency” as a type of virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions that are digitally recorded on a distributed ledger, such as the Blockchain.

If you are selling virtual currency, the IRS now requires you to recognize any capital gain or loss on the sale, subject to any limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.

However, don’t fret yet. Not only are there strategies for minimizing taxes on your crypto gains, but there are also ways to use your crypto losses to offset your taxable income.

Here are three ways you can aim to reduce your crypto taxes for the 2020 reporting period.

DISCLAIMER: Please consult with a tax professional when discussing these principles.

#1 — HODL On Just a Bit Longer

If you’re paying crypto taxes for the first time this year you’ll want to be aware of the difference between how short term and long term gains are taxed.

Why?

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are taxed as property, while assets held for longer than one year are taxed at a lower rate than short-term assets.

Capital Gains Tax Rate and Long-Term Holdings

If you held the virtual currency for one-year or less before selling or exchanging the virtual currency, then you will have a short-term capital gain or loss.

If you held the virtual currency for more than one-year before selling or exchanging it, then you will have a long-term capital gain or loss.

This means that if you are able to track how long you have been holding your crypto you can use this information to decide if you want to sell or hold on long enough to make the one-year mark.

#2 — IRS Wants You to Understand “LIFO” and “HIFO” As Costing Methods

Historically, most traders have opted to use FIFO (first-in first-out) to calculate their crypto capital gains or losses. But with the IRS’ newly issued guidance, traders now have the opportunity to use different, specific identification methods to minimize their tax liability.

The IRS has declared that specific identification methods like “LIFO” (last-in first out) and “HIFO” (highest-in first-out) as acceptable methods, so you can now look to better identify your assets. Changing the chronological order of how you calculate your crypto sales can make a big difference in the final result.

Applying “LIFO” and “HIFO”

Here’s an example of the potential savings you could see if you used “LIFO” or “HIFO,” instead of “FIFO.”

You buy 5 ETH on Coinbase on February 7, 2019 for $500 each.

On March 1 you buy 2 ETH for $700 and on March 7 you buy 4 more for $600 each. In July 2019 you sell 4 ETH for $2,400.

FIFO

If you use FIFO to calculate the capital gain for this sale you will use the purchase price of the first 4 ETH acquired in February (4 * $500) and subtract it from the sale price $2,400.

$2,400 (fair market value) – $2,000 (cost basis) = $400 (capital gain)

LIFO

If you use LIFO you can change the order and calculate a your cost basis with the last 4 ETH purchased in March (4 * $600)

$2,400 (fair market value) – $2,400 (cost basis) = $0 (capital gain)

LIFO is particularly effective for minimizing taxes during times of rising cryptocurrency prices, as the most recently acquired coins will have the highest value. And by selling off your oldest coins first, this method also extends the holding period for your most recently acquired coins, giving them a chance to reach the 1 year minimum to qualify for long-term capital gains rates.

HIFO

Using HIFO, the coins with the highest cost basis will be sold first.

Thus, your cost basis for 4 ETH would be (2 * $700) + (2 * $600) = $2,600.

In this example the HIFO method was used to realize a cost basis ($2,600) that is higher than the sale price ($2,400), leading to a capital loss of $200.

From this example we can see the dramatic effect that specific identifications can have as you calculate your capital gains or losses:

FIFO : $400 capital gain

: $400 capital gain LIFO : $0 capital gain

: $0 capital gain HIFO: $200 capital loss

The key to effectively using this strategy is to maintain clear records of when you bought each coin and the original purchase price.

However, it’s easy to lose track of the cost basis for a coin as you move it through multiple exchanges.

For example, if you purchased a coin on Binance, you may consider moving it to a cold wallet, and then transferring it to Coinbase where you make the final sale.

Why? Coinbase only recognizes that a coin has been transferred. They do not have any way of knowing the cost basis.

At the end of the year, Coinbase cannot give you the documentation you would need (cost basis and date of original purchase) to use LIFO or HIFO.

#3 — Tax Loss Harvesting

If you know that you’ve experienced some losses in your crypto portfolio this year you can use the volatility of the crypto market to your advantage with tax loss harvesting. This is a common strategy used with investors of stocks and securities, but crypto assets have a unique advantage that makes them even more strategic for minimizing your tax liability.

One method, known as “Tax Loss Harvesting” allows you to sell an asset at a loss in order to offset your capital gains.

You can declare up to $3,000 in net losses if you’re filing as a single individual or up to $1,500 if married and filing separately. Anything over those amounts can be carried over to the next year.

We’ll start with an example from the world of stocks.

You buy $1,000 worth of Microsoft stock and $2,000 of Apple in 2019.

Then, Microsoft rises to $2,000 and the Apple falls to $1,500.

You sell the Microsoft at $2,000 and now you you will be taxed on that $1,000 capital gain.

Applying Tax Loss Harvesting, you can offset that capital gain by selling your Apple for $1,500, and taking a loss of $500.

$1,000 (Microsoft gain) – $500 (Apple loss) = $500 (total capital gain)

Think about it. You just strategically sold an asset at a loss, and now you’ve cut your capital gains in half.

But what if you want to buy back that Apple stock and wait for it to appreciate? This is considered a “wash sale,” and pursuant to the SEC, there are rules (IRS Publication 550) that prohibit you from deducting losses in this scenario, or other words, rules that would prevent you from buying back that Apple stock within a 30-day window.

This is the point where cryptocurrencies present a unique opportunity, because the IRS has specifically stated that cryptocurrencies are “property not securities,” so wash sale rules do not apply to crypto assets at this time. Following that logic, that could mean you could technically sell a crypto asset at a loss, realize that loss to offset your capital gains, and then buy back the crypto right away.

Unfortunately, December 31 was the deadline to realize your crypto losses for 2019, but with this strategy in mind you can look forward to using Tax Loss Harvesting to offset your capital gains and to balance out any disappointment from under-performing crypto assets.

Do You Have a Headache?

Please keep in mind that you should still one-hundred percent consult with a tax professional when reporting your taxes. Don’t look to us. We are providing you with the insight so you can then discuss with your tax professional the options that may apply to your particular reporting period.

At the end of the day, these three-tactics above should provide you with plenty of motivation to begin collecting your tax records to help keep you pushing through the world of cryptocurrency.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Stablecoin giant Tether Ltd. has just launched a gold-backed cryptocurrency, which is price-pegged to the precious metal. The news was announced in a Jan. 23 web post.

Each token of Tether Gold, or XAUT, is physically backed by one troy fine ounce of gold. Currently, there are 3990.225 XAUT in circulation, meaning that the market cap of the new cryptocurrency is approximately $6.3 million.

Though exchanges must buy at least 50 XAUT ($78,500) worth of Tether Gold, general investors can buy small fractions of the token through an exchange.

Bitfinex, Tether’s sister company, has become the first exchange to add Tether Gold to its listings. XAUT is currently trading on the exchange at roughly $1,570.

Tether Gold’s Practical Features

Tether boasts that its collateral is highly safeguarded. Its gold reserves are held in a Swiss vault, with “best in class security and anti-threat measures,” according to the announcement.

Coinholders can look up the serial number of their assigned gold bars via Tether’s website. Without an audit, this is not full proof that Tether owns the bar in question, but it does give investors some level of assurance.

Tether also offers redemption options for those who hold entire tokens. Investors can have their gold physically delivered or redeemed for cash.

Furthermore, the XAUT token itself can be freely moved on the TRON and Ethereum blockchains, and transactions can be tracked on block explorers like Etherscan.

Facing the Stablecoin Competition

Tether Gold is not the only coin of its type. Paxos, a crypto exchange company, launched a similar stablecoin called PAX Gold last September.

Dozens of other minor projects are also attempting to introduce a gold-backed cryptocurrency, but so far, most have had little success.

Digix, one of the most successful gold-backed coins, briefly saw high trading volumes in August 2018 and January 2019. However, demand for DGX is generally low, and users voted to have the project’s treasury holdings returned to investors this month.

Despite the potential offered by gold-backed stablecoins and other alternatives, dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDT remain the most popular option. This is either due to Tether’s first-mover advantage or due to the U.S. dollar’s general popularity.","More than 85% of employees in the crypto space work for companies focused on three major service areas: exchanges, development, and mining.

The statistic was included in The Block Genesis's Digital Asset Human Capital Trends Report, which was commissioned by the Blockchain Association.

There are 48 firms with 100 or more employees across the crypto industry. The largest employer: Asia-based exchange Huobi Global. Huobi is followed by two other exchanges, OKEx and Coinbase, in terms of the number of workers employed.

Indeed, nearly 46% of employers with more than 100 employees are digital asset exchanges. Development firms account for roughly 29% of employers in that category.

The digital asset space grew into a high growth, professional industry in 2019, boasting some 20,000 employees. Of the largest employers, 67% of them are domiciled outside of the U.S.

If you were hoping to keep your bitcoin stash under wraps from the IRS, think again. As the 2019 tax season kicks off on Jan. 27, the taxman is expecting you to disclose whether you had any cryptocurrency transactions last year. The IRS asks the following question on the first page of Schedule 1 of the individual income tax return: ""At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?"" ""If the answer is yes, then say yes,"" said April Walker, CPA and lead manager for tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of CPAs. ""But from a documentation standpoint, there are many different ways that you can interact with cryptocurrency,"" she said.

""The overarching idea is, however you transact with it, you'll need to track your transactions,"" said Walker. This new question is only the latest salvo from the IRS, signaling the taxman's heightened interest in virtual currency. Last summer, the agency sent letters to more than 10,000 taxpayers with cryptocurrency transactions who may have failed to report income and pay taxes owed. Here's what you should be aware of when reporting your virtual currency to the IRS.

How is it taxed?

Generally, the IRS treats virtual currency as property, much the same way they would regard stocks or other investments. That means that if you bought your Ethereum and then sold it — or if you exchange it for something else, you're logging either a capital gain or a loss. You'd be responsible for taxes related to the gain. While cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase may provide you with a Form 1099-K detailing these transactions, there's no guarantee you'll get one. ""The taxpayer has to have at least $20,000 in gross sales for the year and a minimum of 200 transactions to get a 1099-K,"" said Andy Phillips, director for The Tax Institute at H&R Block.

Say you paid $10 for virtual currency, but then bought coffee for $8. You have a $2 loss you need to report. April Walker lead manager for tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of CPAs

On the other hand, virtual currency that you get from an employer is treated like wages: You must have federal income taxes withheld from the payment, as well as FICA tax and unemployment taxes. All of this must be reported on your Form W-2, which you should receive from your employer by the end of January. Finally, cryptocurrency that you mine must be included in your taxable income. That is, you're including the fair market value of your bitcoin as of the date of receipt. Don't try hiding your stash from the taxman. You're running the risk of an audit, as well as paying penalties and interest on the income you failed to report. In the most extreme cases, you could face prison time and a fine of up to $250,000.

Cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology are on a meteoric rise in Latin America.

The digital money’s lack of regulation has shrouded the industry in stories of criminal enterprise; and there’s no doubt that corruption, secrecy and illicit laundering play an important part in Latin America’s adoption of cryptocurrency.

But the region’s warp-speed adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also stems from innovative initiatives to combat corruption and theft, boost corporate productivity and promote beneficial public policy.

Young, Unbanked and Connected Embrace Crypto

According to a study published last year by Statista, one of the world’s leading statistics portals, the Latin American region holds the largest number of cryptocurrency users in the world.

Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico and Chile all fall within the top 10 cryptocurrency countries (Venezuela was not a study participant). Meanwhile, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and France were closer to the bottom of the list.

Why?

Much of Latin America has been wracked by financial chaos in recent years. Amid unemployment and falling reserves, Argentina’s inflation rose 53.8% in 2019. Rising prices also plagued Brazil, where in 2015 inflation increased to the highest rate in 13 years. Despite the risk and volatility of cryptocurrency, digital assets have nonetheless become a viable alternative to shaky national currencies.

Good for Remittances

Similarly, cryptocurrency offers a quick and secure method to send remittances. In recent years, migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean have been sending a record amount of money to their home countries.

Startups such as La PlataForma of Chile, for example, allows users to transfer funds to family or friends in a variety of the region’s countries via blockchain technology. As millions of Venezuelans flee to make new lives in other countries, Colombian company Valiu created a blockchain-powered system that transfers remittances to Venezuela in less than one hour and in a way that prevents loss or theft.

Meanwhile, the barrier to entry for cryptocurrency in many Latin American countries is often lower than traditional forms of financial management. About half of the Latin American population has no access to basic banking services. Just 113 million people out of a population of about 650 million have credit cards.

On the other hand, the World Bank reports that 55% of adults in Latin America own a mobile phone and have access to the internet, 15 percentage points more than the average in developing nations. A large unbanked population with access to WiFi makes diving into cryptocurrency far easier than opening a checking account.

Venezuela: A Lifeline for Citizens …

No country in Latin America shows the two sides of cryptocurrency better than Venezuela. As the nation has seen its currency rendered valueless amid record, Zimbabwe-style hyperinflation, Venezuelans have turned to digital money as an alternative to the Bolívar.

With appropriate regulation, the region may become the global leader of efficient, real-world applications for cryptocurrencies.

Even amid persistent blackouts, Venezuela is today one of the top markets for peer-to-peer crypto transactions, according to LocalBitcoins, a popular bitcoin trading platform. Crypto is a common payment method on the country’s top e-commerce platform, freelancers often price their services in Bitcoin and even brick-and-mortar retailers list their prices in digital money (in January 2020, Burger King started to accept cryptocurrency in Venezuela).

Cryptocurrency has also served Venezuela as a key tool for humanitarian relief.

The Venezuelan government’s refusal to formally declare a humanitarian emergency has blocked aid from many international agencies. In turn, digital money has allowed in-country charities, like the Bitcoin for Venezuela Initiative, to receive cryptocurrency donations for food, medicine, clothing and other resources that Venezuelans need, bypassing corrupt officials and the regime’s restrictions.

That’s the positive news.

… and Bad Actors

However, Venezuela has seen rampant use of cryptocurrency by bad actors. Venezuela is a nation wracked by drug trafficking, corruption, illegal mining, agriculture and other criminal activities.

As Venezuela became increasingly isolated from the global financial system, the regime tried to ring-fence itself from outside pressure by attempting to launch the world’s first sovereign cryptocurrency — the Petro — in a largely failed bid. The government tried to push its digital currency on Venezuelans, including launching a new international casino run on Petro and forcing airlines to buy fuel with Petro. The government also helped normalize cryptocurrency among Venezuelans by giving it away, airdropping Petro to military members and retirees ahead of the recent holiday season.

Meanwhile, the state-owned oil company PDVSA is counting on Venezuela’s central bank to hold cryptocurrencies in its coffers and wants the government to use crypto to pay entities to which PDVSA owes money.

In January this year, President Nicolas Maduro signed a decree to sell 4.5 million barrels of oil from PDVSA’s reserves in exchange for the Petro cryptocurrency.

Regulating Crypto

One major factor that will expand, mature and normalize the cryptocurrency industry in Latin America is the active participation of governments in the market’s regulation and promotion.

That is already happening. On August 1 in Brazil last year, regulation came into force requiring Brazilian residents to report transactions involving cryptocurrencies. Brazil’s Federal Revenue Service, known as Receita Federal, reports some $3 billion (R$12.5 billion) across a total of 2.49 million cryptocurrency transactions, declared by taxpayers between August and September 2019. Brazil’s Central Bank has also officially recognized cryptocurrencies as an asset in the calculation of the balance of payments.

Meanwhile, the region’s governments are also actively promoting cryptocurrency’s underlying blockchain technology. For example, Colombia’s attorney general’s office is using a blockchain network to boost transparency in awarding new contracts and minimize cases of corruption.

In December 2019, Colombia announced a new government initiative to boost the adoption of blockchain technology in the country. Meanwhile, Colombia’s state oil company, Ecopetrol, recently announced new investments in blockchain technology to improve its oil and gas supply chains in its 2020 spending plan.

Becoming a Viable Alternative

Latin America represents a breakthrough region for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry — and it is poised for even greater growth. Digital currency has a long way to go before becoming mainstream. Adoption can’t just stem from financial desperation and a desire for secrecy.

But while part of the cryptocurrency story is about misconduct and corruption, there’s real evidence that Latin America is taking crypto as a serious and viable alternative to traditional currency. With appropriate regulation, the region may become the global leader of efficient, real-world applications for cryptocurrencies.","Dubai Launching Crypto Valley in Tax-Free Zone – No Personal or Corporate Income Tax

A Dubai government authority has announced that it is launching a crypto valley in the country’s free zone where there is no personal or corporate income tax. With the help of its partners from the Swiss crypto valley, Dubai will offer a variety of services such as incubation for startups, coworking facilities, blockchain training, education, events, mentoring and funding.

Crypto Valley in Dubai’s Free Zone

DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Centre), a Dubai government entity, announced at Davos 2020 on Thursday that it is launching a crypto valley in its free zone, at the heart of the city’s leading business district. DMCC explained that it is “Designed to foster growth, collaboration and integrity across the global blockchain economy,” elaborating:

The ‘DMCC Crypto Valley’ will offer a variety of services including incubation for early-stage startups, co-working facilities, innovation services for corporate clients, blockchain and entrepreneurship training, education, events, mentoring and funding.

“The launch of the crypto valley in DMCC will enhance the city’s dynamic business environment, and support the wider strategy of the UAE government to attract the innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers that will shape the future economy,” commented Executive Chairman and CEO Ahmed Bin Sulayem.

Established in 2002, DMCC aims to enhance commodity trade flows through the country. Its free zone offers a range of benefits including 0% personal and corporate income tax. Members can also remit all profits made back to their home countries without restriction. In October 2019, DMCC received the Financial Times Fdi magazine’s “Global Free Zone of the Year” award for the fifth consecutive years. A total of 85 global free zones were nominated in the 2019 competition.

Situated in the heart of Dubai, DMCC is home to over 100,000 people and 17,000 member companies representing more than 170 countries and 20 business sectors. The companies range from startups to multinational corporations. Every month, 170 more companies join DMCC, 95% of which are new to Dubai, the authority says.

Partners From Swiss Crypto Valley

For the crypto valley launch, DMCC is collaborating with Swiss investment company Crypto Valley Venture Capital (CV VC) and its subsidiary CV Labs to develop “a comprehensive DMCC Blockchain Strategy that is aligned with the Emirates Blockchain Strategy 2021, and supports the Dubai Blockchain Strategy launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the crown prince of Dubai and chairman of Dubai Executive Council.” The agreement between the companies was signed on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.

“We are thrilled to move into the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] region with DMCC as a strong local partner,” CV VC and CV Labs founder Ralf Glabischnig commented, adding:

We are looking forward to bringing our strong partner from crypto valley to Dubai, like Coreledger, Inacta, Lykke, and Tezos which are already active in the MENA region.

With the launch of its own crypto valley, Dubai joins the company of Switzerland and the Philippines, which have already established their own crypto valleys. The Philippines has built a crypto valley of Asia which will soon get its own airport.

The Bitcoin Gold (BTG) network suffered another set of 51% attacks on January 23-24, as roughly 29 blocks were removed in two deep blockchain reorganizations (reorgs). Reports indicate that more than 7,000 BTG was double spent ($70,000) in two days.

Also read: Bitcoin Gold Hacked for $18 Million

Bitcoin Gold Sees Two Deep Blockchain Reorgs With 29 Blocks Replaced

In May 2018, the Bitcoin Gold (BTG) blockchain was 51% attacked for the first time suffering a loss of more than $18 million. BTG is a fork of the Bitcoin protocol but it doesn’t use the SHA256 consensus algorithm like BTC, BCH, or BSV. The blockchain BTG utilizes a variant of the Equihash algorithm (Equihash 144, 5 or “Zhash”) which can be mined with a GPU. Bitcoin Gold’s creators believed that creating a Bitcoin fork that could be mined with GPUs as opposed to ASIC devices would be more decentralized. However, things went south in the spring of 2018 when a miner gained control of more than 51% of the overall BTG hashrate. After losing $18 million, BTG was also asked to pay the exchange Bittrex back or face being delisted. Since then BTG has been meandering along while other small coins like ethereum classic and vertcoin were 51% attacked too.

Last week on Thursday and Friday, BTG again dealt with a malicious mining entity as more than 51% of the chain’s hashrate was captured and still is. The blockchain suffered from two deep reorgs on both days that saw $19,000 double spent on Thursday and $53,000 double spent on Friday. For instance, at approximately 1:01 p.m. on Thursday, BTG’s chain saw 14 blocks removed and 13 new blocks added. At 7:24 p.m. on Friday, the blockchain saw 15 blocks removed and 16 blocks added during a small period of time. Most of the blame has been directed at the cloud mining operation Nicehash which has been blamed for most of the 51% attacks in the last two years. Some BTG members believe that there are secret ASICs mining the BTG network and community members are begging for a safer algorithm.

“I think it’s time we get a real leader that listens to the members of this community and take action,” one BTG proponent wrote on Reddit. “It is obvious that the first 51% attack was done by ASICs — Why can’t BTG be novel and create a truly new [algorithm]? This coin is a bad investment for anyone looking to buy — None of the devs are qualified.”

$719 per Hour to Attack as Nicehash Captures 57% of the Bitcoin Gold Hashrate

During the last few months, news.Bitcoin.com has reported on how the three main SHA256 Bitcoin forks have seen an exponential rise in hashrate. BTG’s hashrate, on the other hand, has not followed the same pattern and has declined significantly since the last 51% attack in May 2018. The lack of hashpower behind the BTG network makes the blockchain extremely vulnerable to more 51% attacks unless the developers change the consensus algorithm. According to statistics from the Crypto51 application, BTG only has 3 million hashes per second (3MH/s) securing the chain. It would only cost $788 per hour to 51% attack the BTG blockchain and cause a reorg with double spending.

The cloud mining site Nicehash sells individuals and businesses CPU and GPU-based hashrate and on January 26, Nicehash commands 57-74% of the BTG hashrate or 2MH/s. A comparison of how much easier it is to attack the Bitcoin Gold chain in contrast to the Zcash (ZEC) network shows it’s far more convenient to attack BTG. Even though they share a similar Equihash variant, ZEC has 5 billion hashes per second (5GH/s) securing the blockchain. Nicehash miners who are mining ZEC only capture 182 MH/s of the overall 5GH/s or a mere 3% of the network. The estimated cost to 51% attack ZEC is much larger than the BTG attack at $11,788 per hour to accomplish the mission.

Interestingly enough, and similar to coins like vertcoin and ethereum classic, BTG’s market price did not drop in value. In fact, BTG’s price has jumped since the 51% attack and is up over 9.6% for the week and 15% in the last 24 hours. To most observers, it is strange that instead of losing value after two deep reorgs and $70,000 in double spends, BTG is seeing more market demand than it has in months.

The data gives excellent insight to the actual way coins are being held and moved around by cryptocurrency users.

Analysts Leverage UTXOs to Quantify Onchain Data

UTXOs are Unspent Transaction Outputs. The easiest way to understand UTXOs is to imagine a cryptocurrency token as a 5 dollar bill. If you buy a soft drink for 2 dollars and spend your 5 dollar bill, you should receive 3 dollars in change. You no longer have the 5 dollar bill, the 2 dollars you gave to the soft drink vendor is your input, and now the UTXO of the vendor. Your change is your Unspent Transaction Output or UTXO of 3 dollars. A blockchain simply keeps track of who has access to which UTXOs.

Be aware that not all cryptocurrencies or blockchains use this UTXO model, but many do, as this was the mechanism chosen by Satoshi for Bitcoin, and many blockchains are based upon or forked directly from Bitcoin’s codebase. Other blockchains like Ethereum, use an accounts-based system similar to your checking account at your local bank.

Jesus Rodriguez analyzed the UTXO sets of several of the most popular public blockchains like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash and Bitcoin Cash. The information he discovered uses metrics like UTXO age, UTXOs spent and UTXOs created to provide an insider’s view of the behavior of cryptocurrency users.

UTXO analysis is invaluable to those who desire to find patterns and trends in blockchain usage. This kind of information could give traders an insight into market fluctuations and other information that could give them an edge. UTXOs offer a unique way to look at cryptocurrencies that simply can’t be done with other assets.

Bitcoin Hodl Waves and Other Blockchain Curiosities

One of the original UTXO studies was Unchained Capital’s Hodl Wave analysis, which calculated the “age” of a specific Bitcoin UTXO. This means when it was last used in a transaction, not the age it was created through mining. Unchained Capital found that there have been several “Hodl Waves”. A Hodl Wave is an epoch when many accumulated Bitcoin and put them into cold storage. There have 3-4 such mass accumulations with a large amount of UTXOs which have not moved since. Data shows that these hodlers are still accumulating more Bitcoin.

Jesus’ research also demonstrates these Hodl Waves, with his findings showing that 4 million Bitcoins haven’t moved in the last 5 years, in contrast with about a half a million Bitcoin that move every seven days or so. This kind of data could show the difference in the behavior of traders and savers. This same Hodl Wave data shows similar findings for Dash, even with its wild movements in price, the pattern holds true.

One of the more interesting findings from the IntoTheBlock research is the creation of new UTXOs and price fluctuations. In the data for Litecoin, the data showed the number and volume of UTXOs created over a set period of time. This metric was highly correlated to price movements and gave data on real transactions as opposed to just transfers.

The UTXOs spent metric is similar to the UTXOs created metric but shows the amount of spending taking place and provides a trend indicator of the balanced composition of the network. Jesus’ research analyzed the last 3 months of data for the Bitcoin network.

UTXO analysis is a very unique way to analyze public blockchain data by studying the nuts and bolts of the blockchain’s immutable ledger to gain insights not normally available for other investments. This kind of information will play a huge part for traders and investors who want to know about the trends actually happening in real life with blockchain participants. It remains to be seen how Coinjoin and other methods to foil blockchain analysis will impact this kind of research.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has awarded a young entrepreneur for her cryptocurrency price tracking application while the government is still deliberating on the country’s crypto policies. News.Bitcoin.com caught up with the award recipient to find out more about her app. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is being challenged in the supreme court regarding its crypto action.

Modi Awards Creator of Crypto App

While the Indian government is deliberating on whether to regulate or ban cryptocurrencies in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has awarded a young entrepreneur for her cryptocurrency tracking app creation. Modi tweeted on Jan. 24: “I am delighted that the very talented Harshita Arora has been conferred the Bal Shakti Puraskar 2020 … She has been focussing on a wide range of sectors. Her passion towards science, technology and human welfare are clearly visible.”

The award recipient, 18-year-old Kumari Harshita Arora, created an app called Crypto Price Tracker, a portfolio management and price tracking tool for cryptocurrencies, which she designed herself.

Interacting with the award winners at his residence, the prime minister said that he is proud to see the awareness of their duty towards society and the nation, local media reported. There were 49 winners in various categories; Arora was awarded the Bal Shakti Puraskar 2020 for her excellence in innovation. Noting that he gets inspiration and energy from the award recipients, Modi was quoted as saying: “When I was getting introduced to you a while back, I was really surprised. The way you all have tried in different fields, the work that has been done at such a young age … is amazing.” The prime minister added:

Whenever I hear about such courageous work of all you young comrades, talk to you, I also get inspiration and energy.

The Bal Shakti Puraskar award is given by the government of India every year “to recognize exceptional achievements of our children in various fields i.e., innovation, scholastic achievements, social service, arts & culture, sports and bravery,” explained the government’s website. It is also “to recognize the contribution of dedicated individuals and institutions, whose tireless efforts complement the actions taken by the government of India for the welfare of children.”

Arora’s Crypto Tracking App

News.Bitcoin.com caught up with Arora who shared some details about her award-winning app. “I created a cryptocurrency portfolio management and price tracking application called Crypto Price Tracker and launched it on the App Store in Jan 2018,” she told the news team, noting that it was later acquired by Redwood City Ventures. The entrepreneur elaborated:

My app received a lot of positive feedback from the crypto community and got thousands of paid downloads in the first 24 hours of launch which led it to becoming the #2 app in the Finance category of the App Store.

Crypto Price Tracker is a portfolio management app that does price tracking and customizable alerts. It tracks the prices of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies from over 18 exchanges in 32 fiat currencies. It also provides price charts for all monitored cryptocurrencies during the last one day, one week, one month, three months, and one year.

Users can create time-based alerts to get prices of a coin as a push notification regularly or at a specific time. They can also create price threshold-based alerts to get notifications when the price of a certain coin drops, rises or changes by a certain percentage. The app is available in the Apple app store, but not in the U.S., however.

Is the Indian Government Changing Its Stance on Crypto?

An entrepreneur winning such a prestigious award from the Indian government for crypto-related work came as a surprise to many in the crypto community since lawmakers have been considering an anti-crypto bill. The interministerial committee (IMC) headed by former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg recommended a ban on all cryptocurrencies, except state-issued ones. Garg has since resigned but maintains a negative view on the future of cryptocurrencies.

“Now this is interesting,” Varun Sethi, also known as Blockchain Lawyer, tweeted in response to the news of Arora receiving the award, pointing out that the “draft law by the interministerial committee imposes punishment for direct / indirect use of cryptos.”

Indeed, the crypto bill drafted by the IMC states that “No person shall directly or indirectly use cryptocurrency in any manner,” including providing cryptocurrency-related services to consumers or investors. Those in violation face a fine or imprisonment of “not be less than

one year but which may extend up to ten years, or both,” according to the text of the bill. However, the bill has not been introduced in parliament and the Indian crypto community believes that it is flawed and will not be introduced as is.

Indian social media influencer by the name “Shalini” commented, “India is in a love-hate relationship with cryptocurrency,” adding:

While RBI fights against crypto in the supreme court, our prime minister just awarded Harshita Arora a prestigious award for innovation in various fields including crypto (she created a crypto price tracking app).

The Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly displayed its negative stance towards cryptocurrency. In April 2018, it issued a circular banning regulated financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. The supreme court is currently hearing the petitions against this ban, which will resume next week.

Announced Friday, the consortium seeks to bring together financial institutions, government representatives, developers and other members of the global community to determine what sort of governance around cryptocurrencies can best further the goal of financial inclusion.

Digital currencies are “a key area of interest for the Forum,” said WEF Founder and Chairman Klaus Schwab. The area “requires input across sectors, functions and geographies.”

“Building on our long history of public-private cooperation, we hope that hosting this consortium will catalyse the conversations necessary to inform a robust framework of governance for global digital currencies,” he said.

The new consortium has buy-in from a number of central banks from developing nations, as well as the Bank of England’s Mark Carney (who has opined on the potential of digital currencies before) and several non-governmental organizations.

David Marcus of the Libra Association, Joe Lubin of ConsenSys and Neha Narula of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative also praised the effort in a press release.","A lawsuit accuses the frontman of the Tron cryptocurrency and his business associate of harassing and firing two employees, allegedly as payback for the employees’ objections to management practices and applications of the technology they were developing.

In a 70-page document filed in October in the California Superior Court for San Francisco County, Richard Hall, 50, and Lukasz Juraszek, 28, said they put up with escalating hostilities on the job that culminated in their termination last summer from BitTorrent, a file-sharing service that combined with the Tron Foundation in a $120 million sale two years ago.

The Tron Foundation is the main sponsor of the Tron cryptocurrency. Justin Sun, Tron Foundation’s 29-year-old founder and CEO, and Cong Li, 37, the head of engineering, are named together with the companies as defendants in the lawsuit, made public last week.

According to the lawsuit, Sun berated Hall with derogatory exclamations to pressure him into fast-tracking BitTorrent software releases. On other occasions, Juraszek claimed, Sun slapped Li and was never disciplined for it, and Li appeared to have physically hit a manager whom he allegedly had a pattern of verbally attacking in person and in group chats.

“Lukasz Juraszek saw two sets of shoes under the conference room door,” the lawsuit said, referring to Li and the manager, “and then heard a loud commotion coming from the room and then what seemed like a punch, slap or a strike of a hand.” After Li opened the door to leave the room, Juraszek saw the manager’s “face was red, his eyes glossy.”

The lawsuit also highlights the ethical dilemmas confronting cryptocurrency professionals working on technology touted as value-neutral that can be used to break laws. Hall said he flagged the risks of third parties hosting copyright-infringing content and child pornography, but Sun and Li cared little about his proposal to retain lawyers to review the Tron Foundation’s BitTorrent updates.

“Cong Li summarily dismissed these concerns, stated that he had discussed these concerns with Justin Sun, and that no legal review would be done,” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit is pursuing $15 million in damages and government action against claims of labor law violations, on grounds of wrongful termination, discrimination, emotional distress and hostile work conditions. A response submitted to the court in December by the Tron Foundation, BitTorrent, Sun and Li contested the charges’ motivations, jurisdiction and factual substance.

In a statement from a spokesperson, Sun and Li said: “Tron is not able to speak on the details of pending litigation, but what we can tell you is that our customers, employees and the Tron community are extremely important to us.”

'Impossibly high standards'

After the conference room incident, the manager informed Juraszek that Li schemed to “hold him to impossibly high engineering standards” and boot him from the company for reporting what he observed to human resources, the lawsuit said. Then, Juraszek claimed, unknown users logged in under his work computer’s ID from another location and his emails disappeared.

Hall, who said sabotage also extended to him, claimed Li threatened to fire him if he took a vacation that had already been approved in writing under company policy, instead of canceling the travel without seeking a contractually guaranteed reimbursement.

Choosing to go on vacation anyway, Hall upon his return was demoted by Li, who tried to deter him from documenting their verbal conversations in emails, making such threats as, “If you go tighter with me, I will go tighter with you,” “things will end badly for you,” and “I cannot protect you,” according to the lawsuit.

Their eventual firings, they argued, amounted to cases of retaliation and discrimination. The lawsuit, and the complaints to a California employment board that greenlighted it, said the plaintiffs never fared poorly on job evaluations — Juraszek claimed he was even promoted at a higher salary prior to the conflicts — and that mainland Chinese hires came to replace them and other domestic employees. Sun and Li are Chinese nationals.

To Hall and Juraszek, the new recruits from China seemed prone to being steered into behaving less responsively toward American laws and customs than they would have, giving Sun the upper hand to enforce a “9-9-6” Chinese office schedule — 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., 6 days a week — and brush off unlawful BitTorrent material, the lawsuit said.

Juraszek’s own investigation surfaced pirated movies on a BitTorrent website, said the lawsuit, which recalled that even when told about the risks, Sun pushed forward to keep up with deadlines, and that the manager told Juraszek that Li lied to his team about obtaining go-ahead from corporate counsel.

BitTorrent has dealt with recurring copyright lawsuits and law enforcement investigations since it opened at the turn of the century as an environment to freely download books, music, television shows and movies.

Hall, a product director, lasted seven months until June at the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent. Juraszek, a software engineer, started in February and ended in August.

Neither Juraszek nor the lawyers for either side answered requests for comment by press time. Hall declined to comment.

Controversial chief

The court case throws Sun deeper into the fray of mounting scrutiny over his cryptocurrency businesses.

Well in advance of the Tron cryptocurrency’s circulation, traders uncovered paragraphs in the Tron white paper — a document laying out its blockchain model — that had been lifted verbatim from other cryptocurrency white papers. Sun chalked it up to unknowing volunteers with purported translation difficulties.

Zhiqiang Chen, Tron Foundation’s first CTO, who left to spin up a Tron competitor, would find himself in May denying Sun’s accusations he had been fired for embezzlement, bribery, non-disclosure violations and trade theft. Sparking the fight was Chen’s now-deleted blog post communicating worries that Sun and the Tron Foundation could override the Tron blockchain.

In the aftermath of the Tron Foundation’s takeover a year earlier, BitTorrent was plagued with resignations by employees who echoed that Sun exaggerated their technology’s promise and accessed too many Tron nodes, points of power in the Tron blockchain that affect its cryptocurrencies’ prices. Winners of Tron contests and sweepstakes have also faulted Sun for discrepancies in how prizes have been advertised and received.

Jared Tate, the creator of the Digibyte virtual currency, also known as DGB, blamed related broadsides he personally lobbed at the Tron Foundation in December as the reason for his token’s delisting on Poloniex, a cryptocurrency exchange Sun bought with a group of investors in the fall.

Most conspicuously, amid reports the Chinese government had placed him on a travel ban on suspicions of illegal financial dealings, Sun took to Chinese social media network Weibo in July to publicly apologize to Chinese state officials for flaunting his winning $4.6 million bid on a charity lunch with Warren Buffett.

Sun postponed the lunch but was spotted at a Tron event on the same day. The Tron Foundation, whose official Weibo account was suspended in November during a government crackdown on cryptocurrencies, had claimed he needed to recover from a bout of kidney stones.

Staffed in Beijing and San Francisco, the Tron Foundation is a Singapore non-profit that supports the development of the Tron blockchain and its add-on features: a digital platform for mobile and web utilities such as entertainment, gambling and gaming that are available in Samsung’s blockchain store, and a network for different cryptocurrencies including bitcoin-dollar peg Tether and TRX, the Tron cryptocurrency.

BitTorrent under Tron’s management facilitates BitTorrent token, BTT, payments to send and receive files or buy faster download times. TRX, traded between less than one cent and 20 cents over the past three years, has fallen from a peak market capitalization of $13 billion to $1 billion today.

","The partnership between BitPay and Simplex will facilitate the process of purchasing cryptocurrencies within the BitPay app.

Popular Bitcoin payment processor BitPay has sealed a partnership with fiat-to-crypto payment processor Simplex, enabling users to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly within the BitPay app using a credit card. They can also transfer funds, make purchases and send money to friends from a single dashboard.

In providing BitPay with a fiat onramp to conduct and settle crypto transactions, Simplex has created a major on-ramp to the cryptoconomy. Over 30,000 merchants use BitPay, and the company processed over $1 billion in cryptocurrency transactions in 2018. Simplex has previously tied up similar agreements with Binance and Huobi, enabling users of those platforms to buy crypto with credit card directly on the exchange.

Big Day for BitPay

The Simplex deal significantly enhances BitPay’s capabilities. Existing and would-be users can tap into a single portal that converts fiat to crypto for crypto payments and crypto to fiat for BitPay card transactions. In connecting its payment rails with those of the fiat world, BitPay is enhancing key infrastructure that will facilitate broader accessibility and utility of digital assets.

The Atlanta, Georgia-based payment processor is not alone. The Simplex agreement is part of a broader industry trend towards constructing crypto onramps. Other examples include Plutus, a mobile application that dispenses loyalty tokens that are awarded on purchases. Plutus users can also convert fiat to crypto in-app, as can users of Skrill, Monarch and hybrid fiat and crypto-powered banking alternative Wirex.

Square’s Cash App, which is headed up by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, is another major on-ramp, helping users purchase, sell, store and deposit bitcoin, doubling as a bitcoin exchange and custodial wallet. The Cash App has become one of the main retail onramps in the U.S., accounting for $150 million of bitcoin purchases in Q3 of 2019 – or 8.6% of the total BTC mined during that period.

Binance, meanwhile, recently added tabs for payment processors WeChat and AliPay, expanding its range of fiat onramps in China particularly. While the Chinese government has been famously wary of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, President Xi Jinping’s recent endorsement of blockchain technology lead to a short-lived surge in bitcoin’s price.

Enhanced Fiat Options for Traders

It’s not just fiat onramps that are connecting the cryptoconomy with its fiat counterpart: new stablecoin projects have also lifted off, powered by hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital. There are now over 200 stablecoins on the market, with these asset-backed cryptocurrencies providing an alternative bridge between the world of mainstream finance and crypto. Central banks are also developing their own digital currencies, though only China’s appears close to seeing the light of day.

The BitPay-Simplex partnership is primarily targeted at cryptocurrency exchange users initially. In a statement, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said that “cryptocurrency exchanges can be intimidating for new users. The Simplex integration, however, makes the blockchain payment experience seamless.” BitPay’s reach and reputation coupled with Simplex’s payment processing capabilities will give traders the ability to convert fiat-to-crypto and vice-versa quickly and confidently."
2020-01-27,"Bitcoin traders are split on whether the cryptocurrency’s once-every-four-years “halving” will jolt prices toward 2017’s all-time-high near $20,000 or multiples of that.

What’s clear is interest in the topic is surging on Google, according to a report from the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research.

The search engine’s Google Trends feature shows queries on the term “bitcoin halving” have doubled this month from December levels to the highest since the last such event in 2016.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

According to Arcane Research, the increasing number of Google searches is a sign the halving might be capturing greater public interest as a potential catalyst for higher prices in 2020.

“The bitcoin halving is gaining more traction,” Arcane said Friday in the report. “There is now a clear indication that awareness of the concept is spreading to new people.”

Google Trends doesn’t disclose the actual number of searches on “bitcoin halving” but does publish data showing the search term registered a reading of 35 during the week ended Jan. 19, up from an average 15 during the month of December. The scale is normalized so that a reading of 100 represents the peak of a particular search term’s popularity.

For “bitcoin halving,” that happened in 2016, when the last such event occurred. Bitcoin prices doubled that year and surged by 13 times in 2017.

The halving was codified into bitcoin’s underlying software code when the cryptocurrency was launched just over a decade ago. Every four years, the bitcoin network undergoes a 50 percent reduction in its “mining rewards” – essentially the number of new units of the cryptocurrency issued as rewards to computer operators that are working to confirm data on the underlying blockchain network.

Some crypto investors say the event could boost bitcoin’s price because the pace of new issuance will decrease at a time when more investors are considering getting into, or increasing their allocations of, the cryptocurrency. As an investment, bitcoin has outperformed traditional assets like equities, with a price jump of 94 percent in 2019 that was roughly triple last year’s gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks.

Analysts for the German bank BayernLB predicted last year the halving could send bitcoin to a new record around $90,000, but some investors maintain that the event is so well telegraphed and understood that it’s likely already reflected in the market price, currently around $8,500.

Within the crypto industry, the halving is highly anticipated. Some enthusiasts have even created a dedicated website to count down the remaining days, hours, minutes and seconds until it happens. According to the site, bitcoinblockhalf.com, the event will take place on or around May 12 – now just 108 days away.","Bitcoin’s price fluctuations do not make it a “reliable” store of value, according to new research from financial services giant Deutsche Bank.

In the first part of its 3-series “The Future of Payments” reports, published last week, Germany-headquartered Deutsche Bank said while cryptocurrencies have “passed the tipping point needed to become fashionable,” they are still in the “early adoption stage.”

Particularly for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, the bank said it is “too volatile” to be a “reliable” store of value. It referenced bitcoin’s sharp price fluctuations during 2017-2018.

Bitcoin payments also still represent a “tiny” fraction of global payments, according to Deutsche Bank, although it said such payments have taken off.

Overall, the bank believes that cryptocurrencies have the potential to ""revolutionize"" payments. “Looking ahead, it may not be surprising if a new and mainstream cryptocurrency were to unexpectedly emerge,” it added.

In the second part of the series, also published last week, Deutsche Bank said cash would be around for “decades to come.” The third part - “Digital Currencies: the Ultimate Hard Power Tool” - published Monday, states that ""a new digital currency could become mainstream within the next two years.""



""Still in their infancy, digital currencies have the potential to radically change payments, banking, central banking, and the balance of economic power,"" said the bank.

Just last month, Deutsche Bank said crypto has the potential to replace cash in the next decade, as the current fiat system looks “fragile.” It added at the time that crypto needs to become legal in the eyes of governments and regulators to become widespread.","David is a tech journalist who loves old-school adventure games, techno and the Beastie Boys.

Malicious cryptocurrency miners took control of Bitcoin Gold‘s blockchain recently to double-spend $72,000 worth of BTG.

Bad actors assumed a majority of the network‘s processing power (hash rate) to re-organize the blockchain twice between Thursday and Friday last week: the first netted attackers 1,900 BTG ($19,000), and the second roughly 5,267 BTG ($53,000).

Cryptocurrency developer James Lovejoy estimates the miners spent just $1,200 to perform each of the attacks, based on prices from hash rate marketplace NiceHash.

This marks the second and third times Bitcoin Gold has suffered such incidents in two years.

Double-spenders like to target cryptocurrency exchanges

Any entity that controls more than 51 percent of a blockchain‘s hash rate can decide what version of the blockchain is accepted (or rejected) by the network.

These scenarios also allow for ‘double-spending,’ attacks that initiate a transaction with intent to quickly reverse it by ‘re-organizing’ the blockchain, so that they can spend their original cryptocurrency again.

Evidence of double-spending, courtesy of GitHub

What results is a third party accepting the original transaction and the network returns the cryptocurrency spent to the attacker, essentially allowing their funds to be used twice — hence the name ‘double-spending.‘

With Bitcoin, a transaction is generally deemed legitimate once found six blocks deep in the blockchain. These particular 51-percent attackers performed re-organizations up to 16 blocks deep, seemingly in a bid to trick exchanges like Binance into paying out BTG destined to be double-spent.

“We note that at the time of the attack, on Binance deposits of BTG were credited to one’s account for trading after six confirmations, and were available for withdrawals after twelve confirmations,” said Lovejoy. “A fourteen or fifteen block reorg would thus evade both of Binance‘s escrow periods.”

He then provided a screenshot showing that Binance had since increased their BTG withdrawal requirement to 20 confirmations.

Hard Fork has reached out to the exchange to learn more about its response to the incident and will update this piece should we hear back.

Two years ago, cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex chose to delist BTG after 51-percent attackers successfully double-spent $18 million worth of the cryptocurrency in a similar fashion.

Ethereum Classic also suffered a $1.1 million double-spend attack in January last year.","What you need to know when trading Cryptocurrencies



The popularity of Cryptocurrency is on the rise and more and more skeptics are investing in digital assets each day. With people losing trust in central banks, coupled with the allure of investing in a digital currency which could appreciate, these factors have contributed to an industry boom.

What is even more exciting is the options available surrounding Cryptocurrencies nowadays. In the past, investors would simply buy a coin and wait/hope for the value to increase whilst running the risk of having value wiped out of an investment in a volatile market. This is avoidable now thanks to Crypto trading. Much like traditional Forex trading, Crypto enthusiasts can now trade on the projected performance of a coin without necessarily purchasing that asset.

The option of trading Crypto can be far more appealing than investing which comes with constantly monitor price performance. Thanks to leveraged trading on broker platforms, traders can concentrate on: going long and short on a range of Cryptocurrencies opposed to just investing and HODL-ING.

In this article, we will explore some of the major Cryptocurrencies which will suit day traders, scalpers, and swing traders. First of all, let's consider some factors which contribute to a good Cryptocurrency to trade





What factors to consider when trading Crypto





Volatility This is needed as a trader. Coins that are moving the most will give us the most opportunities and the largest opportunities to make gains. To find the most volatile coins we can look to websites with a long list of coins and stats - from there, go to 24hr change and look at the percentage price increase/decrease. From there you will be able to search from lowest to highest and vice versa. If the volatility percentage is shown in green, then this indicates the price is moving upwards and it would be best to input a 'buy trade' or 'go long'. If the volatility percentage is showing in red, this indicates a downward price movement and a 'sell' trade or 'shorting' the asset would be advised.



Fees What is important to consider if the transaction cost or fees applied by your chosen broker or exchange. If a percentage price movement is floating around the 1 - 3% mark, consider these charges and consider if a successful trades profitability would be damaged by added fees.



Volume First off, volume provides liquidity. The more volume available, the more liquidity - meaning more orders can be filled. If you were looking to sell vast amounts of Crypto on an exchange, ensure the exchange can facilitate this. It can often mean that the seller would have to go somewhere else to sell the remainder of the chosen Crypto and sell at a lower price.



Available Assets Ensure that the broker you are trading with has a wide range of assets to long and short, especially the major ones to capitalize on. Many altcoins move according to how other coins or tokens within that network are performing.



Do your own research This is critical when considering your next move on digital currency and the Crypto world as a whole. Use a range of sources to come up with a sound strategy of how to enter a market and when. Using a range of sources helps to distinguish one person's opinion from the general consensus.

Tradable assets





Bitcoin (BTC) So let's get started with the original Cryptocurrency - Bitcoin. Bitcoin was the first Cryptocurrency to emerge as a digital asset. The technology was designed to facilitate electronic transactions without relying on trust or central authority and uses Blockchain technology to function. Bitcoin is now a household name and the interest surrounding the digital coin has reached fever pitch. With the amount of news, controversy and online content surrounding Bitcoin, this has only helped increase interest surrounding Cryptocurrencies. Big-name BTC investors include the Winklevoss twins. They were made famous by their depiction in the movie 'The Social Network' where they fight over who created Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg. The twins own around 1% of the whole circulating supply of Bitcoin making them Bitcoin billionaires! Bitcoin is the number 1 Crypto in the world by quite some distance. The current market cap (Circulating Supply * Price) sits at a whopping $151,684,062,986. Current price is $8,394.53 and a volume of 2,933,660 BTC Bitcoin is the most stable coin out there and will always provide an opportunity to make gains. The question, however, is to 'long' or to 'short' BTC? Enjoy pristine trading conditions, low deposits, and the tightest spreads by depositing BTC at EagleFX today.





Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Bitcoin cash is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This is a fork from the original BTC Blockchain where some developers who disagreed with how to move the BTC Blockchain forward - so built a new one and Bitcoin cash was formed. This is a fork of the original Blockchain containing some additional features including Block size increase and wipeout protection. BCH is stable, fees are low and it facilitates super-fast transactions. The average size of a transaction is around 250 bytes. BCH can handle more transactions per second compared to BTC, transaction fees are cheaper - working out around $0.20 per transaction. Also, more people can use BCH at the same time compared to BTC. All of these factors make BCH more appealing as a peer-to-peer payment system for fast transactions. This has helped catapult BCH to number 4 on the list of Top 100 Cryptocurrencies by Market Capitalization. Current price is $308.15, up from an all-time low of $75.03. BCH reached dizzying heights of $4,355.62 in December 2017. Will we see BCH climb this high anytime soon?





Ethereum (ETH) Launched in 2014, Ethereum is the world's leading programmable blockchain. The local currency to the Ethereum network is Ether. Ethereum's goal is to truly decentralize the Internet. Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized, open-source, and distributed computing platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications, also known as dApps. Smart contracts can not be altered - ensuring a secure payment network. Current ETH price is $161.05 and has a market cap of $17,620,688,401. The flexible network experienced an ATH of $1,432.88 from a low of $0.420897. The ROI for original investors would be a mammoth 5,587.60% This flexible product has applications such as Crypto wallets, financial apps, games and much more showing true flexibility. Surely there can only be further growth for this versatile, digital asset.





Ripple (XRP) Unlike Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, Ripple can not be mined. Mining is the process of completing complex algorithms using high powered computers to complete mathematical equations and once completed, miners are rewarded with Crypto. What is noticeable is the sheer volume of CXRP in circulation - 43,675,903,665XRP! The price per XRP is $0.222813 making it affordable to the masses and with plenty of volume, this makes XRP a suitable trading option. Sitting at 3rd in the Top 100 Cryptocurrencies by Market Capitalization, the stable coin reached an ATH of $3.84 in January 2018. Compared to BTC, transactions on the XRP network are much quicker with transactions taking only a couple of minutes to complete, unlike an average 70/80 minutes for Bitcoin transactions to be confirmed on the Blockchain.





Summary There is a vast array of Crypto that you can trade. Not only hold onto coins but speculate on their value. What is important before investing or trading is to research! Crypto trading is volatile! Find a broker where you can deposit with amounts you are comfortable with and to have available support if and when you may need it. New STP broker EagleFX provides a trading environment on the MT4 platform where users can benefit from high leverage, free sign-ups and generous leverage on a variety of assets including Crypto, Forex and Stocks.

Trade over 30 Cryptocurrency pairs with access to leverage of up to 1:100 for digital currency at new broker EagleFX","Harshita Arora – an 18-year-old cryptocurrency app developer – has won the prestigious Bal Shakti Puraskar 2020 award for her ‘Crypto Price Tracker’ portfolio manager app, which aims to protect users from scammers.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi selected Arora to win the award in recognition of her “passion towards science, technology, and human welfare”.

According to the Indian Ministry of Women and Child’s Development website, the award is given for “exceptional achievements” in a variety of fields such as innovation, scholastic accomplishments, social services, arts and culture, sports, and bravery.

Arora was one of 49 winners in multiple categories and was reportedly chosen due to her excellence in technological innovation.

The Crypto Price Tracker app analyses and keeps records of price movements for more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies from 18 exchanges in 32 fiat currencies.

It has now been acquired by Redwood City Ventures and is available on iOS devices in various parts of the world.

Mr Modi tweeted: “I am delighted that the very talented Harshita Arora has been conferred the Bal Shakti Puraskar 2020!

“She has been focusing on a wide range of sectors. Her passion towards science, technology, and human welfare are clearly visible.”

Some have been quick to note that Arora’s award comes at a critical time with India’s central bank currently in the midst of a supreme court battle with numerous tech companies which could determine the future of cryptocurrency in the nation.

According to Finance Magnates, the debate is centred on whether banks should be allowed to have working relationships with crypto platforms.

The Bal Shakti award being given to someone to recognise their endeavours in the cryptocurrency space could possibly signal a shift in sentiment towards the industry as a whole.

Cryptocurrency transactions in Ukraine will be strictly monitored by the state, although the country’s finance minister admits that it’s not digital coins but fiat cash that criminals and corrupt officials are more likely to use. The legalization of cryptocurrencies remains a priority in Kiev as the government has indicated its clear understanding that the benefits outweigh the risks.

Exchanges and Banks to Collect and Keep User Data

Operations conducted by crypto companies and other entities dealing with digital assets will be examined and verified by Ukraine’s financial regulators, Minister Oksana Markarova announced during a recent press conference. All crypto-related transactions worth 30,000 hryvnias or more, the equivalent of approximately $1,200, will be subjected to government oversight, she emphasized while briefing Ukrainian media about the newly adopted anti-money laundering rules.

Cryptocurrency exchanges, other trading platforms and banks will be obliged to collect, store and provide authorities with detailed information about the identity of their customers, both the sender and the receiver, as well as the origin of the transferred digital money. The data will be gathered only once if a user conducts the same type of crypto transactions.

If a certain transaction raises suspicion, the operator of the platform is required to notify the State Financial Monitoring Service (SFMS). The agency has been charged with establishing the origin of the cryptocurrency and according to the finance minister, the watchdog now has at its disposal “the latest analytical tool” capable of determining where the money comes from and even what it has been spent on previously.

“There have been successful cases,” Markarova said, quoted by crypto outlet Forklog. Currently, the SFMS cannot suspend crypto operations completely but it has the authority to freeze cryptocurrency wallets and seize digital assets that have been obtained illegally or which are intended for illicit purposes, if the agency gets hold of a wallet’s private keys in the course of an investigation.

Parliament Finalizing Regulatory Framework for Cryptocurrencies in Ukraine

The powers of the financial monitoring service were expanded with a law transposing the FATF standards and harmonizing Ukraine’s legislation with European AML directives. It was adopted by the Verkhovna Rada in early December but its provisions will enter into force on April 24, 2020. The Financial Monitoring Bill introduces a set of legal terms pertaining to the crypto space, allocates supervisory duties and details that virtual assets can be traded, transferred and used for payments.

The law lists the different types of entities that can provide exchange, storage, sale, and transfer services for digital assets. It also updates the applicable penalties for various violations such as non-compliance with due diligence and customer identification requirements or breach of procedures for the creation and storage of documents. The maximum fine that can be imposed on these companies has been raised from 34,000 to 204,000 hryvnia (over $8,000). An expert group at the Rada’s Digital Transformation Committee is currently working to finalize the framework that will regulate the circulation of cryptocurrencies in Ukraine.

Oksana Markarova acknowledged there’s no comprehensive data about the amount of cryptocurrency Ukrainian citizens currently hold but experts believe the volume is quite high. According to a 2018 survey, 13% of internet-savvy Ukrainians owned digital coins. It was estimated that the daily turnover on the top three cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country reached $2 million. Two of the platforms, Exmo and Kuna, already have anti-money laundering and know your customer policies in place while the world’s leading exchange Binance recently opened an account with Ibox Bank providing Ukrainians access to global markets.

Ukraine’s finance minister, representing the country’s young administration that came to power after the election of President Volodymyr Zelensky, thinks the legalization of crypto operations can bring positives to the Ukrainian economy which outweigh the risks of using cryptocurrencies for money laundering. “I think that our criminals and corrupt officials are quite conservative and still keep funds mostly in cash. Therefore, in the legalization of cryptocurrencies, I see opportunities for the development of this industry in our country, and not a threat,” Markarova stated in an interview with the online magazine MC Today.

Cryptocurrency exchanges and digital coin issuers were recently listed among the “key players of the financial ecosystem” in Ukraine’s new Financial Sector Development Strategy 2025. The document, prepared by the country’s financial regulators, including the National Bank and the Finance Ministry, also mentions blockchain development as one of five “strategic goals” of innovation growth.

Halliday will report to Gemini’s managing director of U.K. and Europe, Julian Sawyer, and will work closely with the firm’s New York City-based chief compliance officer, Noah Perlman, who was formerly global head of financial crimes at Morgan Stanley.

The move comes as ramped-up regulations go into effect with the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which requires crypto firms to demonstrate compliance with enhanced know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) procedures.

Halliday’s first project will be ensuring Gemini’s risk management practices are in place as the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority reviews its e-money license application, Sawyer said.

“At the moment, our customers in the U.K. have to send money to the U.S. as a wire transfer,” Sawyer said. “An e-money license would allow them to deposit local currency without foreign exchange [costs].”","Iran is actively regulating cryptocurrency miners, months after the government introduced a licensing regime.

The Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade has issued more than 1,000 permits to cryptocurrency miners, according to an official at the Iranian ICT Guild Organization (IIG), an industry body representing the country’s computing sector.

However, IIG’s Amir Hossein Saeedi Naeini said that although there are now licensed cryptocurrency mining operations in the country, the new regulations have not attracted much foreign investment, according to a Financial Tribune report citing Ibena.

“Our studies show that the crypto mining industry has the potential to add $8.5 billion to the economy,” he said to local media. “[But] most potential investors have left for neighboring countries, because they offer incentives for crypto miners.”

The Iranian mining industry has grown significantly in recent years, with many operators attracted to the country because of state-subsidized electricity tariffs. Some of the most popular online Iranian crypto mining channels have thousands of members.

In 2019, the Iranian government proposed legislation that would officially recognize cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate business activity. Under a draft proposal, operators have to submit detailed information about their mining activities in return for a license that would need to be renewed on a yearly basis.

The licensing regime, which received formal approval from the Minister of Industry, Mine and Trade last summer, only applies to mining farms with equipment that consumes more than 30 kilowatts of energy, shutting out smaller household operations.

Prior to the licensing system, some mining operators told CoinDesk they operated within a climate of fear as the penalties for non-compliance were high. Those caught were likely to face fines, the confiscation of their equipment and even jail time. Some said they felt forced to consider moving to neighboring countries.",
2020-01-28,"Something to look forward to: While crypto enthusiasts are no doubt interested to see the effects of Bitcoin's 'halving' slated for later this year, it looks like others are joining the fray. The question on everyone's mind is whether 2020 is the year Bitcoin reaches new heights, and the increase in awareness might well send its price well above the $20,000 mark it reached in 2017... or not.

A lot of people seem interested to see what 2020 will bring for the cryptocurrency industry. Arcane Research points out to how Google searches for related keywords have spiked this month and that might be because on May 20, 2020, the third Bitcoin 'halving' will occur.

That means the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated will decrease by 50 percent of what's been for the past few years. Bitcoin is designed as a deflationary coin that is limited to 21 million units, the last of which will be mined in 2140.

Historically, ""halving"" events have boosted the price of Bitcoin by an order of magnitude, while cutting rewards for miners that solve ""blocks"" of transactions. The current block reward is 12.5 BTC and takes place every 10 minutes, but in May it will go down to 6.25 BTC. Consider for a moment the current price of 1 BTC, which is hovering at ~$9,000 -- give or take a few hundred dollars -- as of writing.

If history were to repeat itself, it could send Bitcoin higher than the already crazy peak of almost $20,000 reached in 2017, possibly even as high as $90,000 if you believe some enthusiastic German bankers. If that sounds impossible, it's worth noting that some of the people that bought this token for pennies close to its inception didn't exactly believe it would become so valuable over time, and nowadays even the most pessimistic investor doesn't see it falling below $5,000 for the foreseeable future.

On one hand, you have people like Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, who thinks Bitcoin would still be undervalued even if it reached $100,000. And considering the sudden increase in public awareness, it's not hard to imagine people rushing to buy Bitcoin in the hopes of makings easy returns if it happens to skyrocket over night.

On the other, you have the skeptics that believe the Bitcoin halving may have already been priced in, in which case there isn't much to gain by pouring your life savings into the cryptocurrency. Then there's the hypothesis that investors and companies will mostly trade in derivatives rather than speculate on Bitcoin.

However, there's enough indication out there that newly mined Bitcoins would most likely be absorbed through Square's Bitcoin purchasing service and Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust. Add to that some 30 million Coinbase customers and people using trading apps like eToro and RobinHood, and you have a lot of variables that will affect Bitcoin's value.

But let's forget the halving for a minute. In the last decade, the best investment you could make was Bitcoin, provided you jumped into the boat relatively early. Some were even able to ride the recent wave of miners that bought each and every capable graphics card on the market hoping to make a profit. Now you'd have to own a large mining operation with specialized equipment somewhere in a cold climate or in places like China where electricity cost is just a few cents per kWh.

Companies like Starbucks and AT&T are slowly adopting Bitcoin as a payment method, while others like Apple might never integrate it into their services. Some would be quick to dismiss it based on how transactions are very slow and not at all energy efficient, but solutions backed by tech executives like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey are on the way to solve that in the near future.

When that happens, there is a good chance the value of Bitcoin will rise, as it has the potential to offer inexpensive financial services for the 1.2 billion people in places like Africa who can't rely on the banking system.

Governments don't like the idea of highly volatile and speculative assets like Bitcoin, but they are much more open to the idea of currency-pegged ""stablecoins."" After the 2020 halving, much of the effort that was previously devoted to mining will have to be directed towards greater adoption, so at least there's a low chance we'll see Bitcoin go down in price.

In any case, expect more companies to follow in the footsteps of Facebook to launch their own cryptocurrencies, which is also known to cause surges in Bitcoin's price as soon as an announcement is made. If anything, 2020 might be the year cryptocurrency hits the mainstream and governments start to take it more seriously.","Share this article

Maker, the Ethereum-based DeFi protocol, remains dominant in decentralized finance, but competitors such as Compound and Synthetix showed strong growth in 2019.

Maker Remains the King of DeFi

MakerDAO, creator of “the world’s first unbiased currency” DAI, enjoyed first mover advantage in the burgeoning DeFi market. With almost $850 million worth of collateral locked in DeFi smart contracts, Maker dominance sits at 57% with almost half a billion dollars in total locked value. The DeFi market itself grew exponentially in 2019, up from just over $250 million since the beginning of last year.

Maker’s dominance is even more pronounced in lending markets, where it powers 78% of total value locked. In the beginning of 2019, Maker was the only DeFi protocol to have locked in significant collateral.

Competitors Emerge

Over the course of last year, however, competitors emerged to take away some of Maker’s market share. The difference is stark. While MakerDAO began 2019 as the only DeFi player of any significance, by the end of the year, it shared the spotlight with a number of rivals.

Most notably, Compound grew with the wider DeFi market, boasting six times the total value locked in U.S. dollar terms than it had at the start of the year. The Compound protocol currently has almost $150 million worth of assets locked in collateral, spanning eight different markets. Ether and Dai dominate Compound contracts, with around $65 and $24 million worth in its protocol, respectively.

Uniswap, a token exchange protocol and liquidity pooling platform, grew its total locked value from $470 thousand to $50 million in 2019, representing 50X growth over the course of the year.

Synthetix grew from less than $2 million to over $150 million in total locked value in the same period of time, to become the second largest player in the market. On the other hand, Maker’s single collateral and multi-collateral Dai have over two million Ether locked up in contracts, representing 16% growth for the year.

With eight major lending protocols, a few of the more recent entrants saw staggering growth rates. According to DeFi Rate, Nuo Network grew by 66,000%, with bZx and InstaDApp both soaring by almost 30,000% in terms of value locked.

Why Has the Landscape Changed so Dramatically?

Maker continues to be the dominant force in DeFi, but it is no longer the only player. As the DeFi market exploded, room was created for competitors. DeFi in 2019 in many ways mirrors the explosion of growth of blockchain projects in 2017.

One of the reasons for the surge in interest in decentralized finance are the high yields. Compared to more traditional assets, DAI and SAI have both seen yields expand to double digits. Those stability fees have been rare, but stablecoin yields in the DeFi market are ordinarily above five percent. Compared to low yielding traditional assets, DeFi contracts provide attractive returns for investors.

The 2019 explosion of growth is probably the most significant reason for the rapid expansion of MakerDAO competitors. According to DeFi Rate, the entire market grew by almost 140% over the year, with the increase in locked DAI growing almost 1,000%.

Derivatives surged by close to 5,000%, the fastest growing segment of the market. The growth in DeFi derivative products explains the success of Synthetix, a “crypto-backed synthetic asset platform that provides on-chain exposure to real-world currencies, commodities, stocks, and indices.”

A year ago, one in every 56 Ether was locked in a DeFi protocol. That figure is now around 37. That hasn’t led to an increase in the price of Ether, which was down slightly for the year. The Ethereum network continues to grow in terms of activity, but its token price has not enjoyed a resultant uptick.

The Future of DeFi

With Bitcoin and Ethereum towering over the remaining 14 most active blockchains, Ethereum’s ecosystem appears healthy and vibrant. It hosts the fastest growing segment of the blockchain landscape in DeFi, but its price decoupled from the level of decentralized finance activity last year despite almost 3% of it being locked up in DeFi contracts.

As the decentralized finance industry matures, it is unlikely to witness such significant rates of growth in the future. But given the emergence of a number of new players in the space in 2019, the makeup of the sector is likely to shift. Maker remains the most significant entity, but as in all areas of crypto, that could change rapidly.

Keeping ahead of the curve and remaining innovative is important. The arrival of decentralized insurance protocol Nexus Mutual last year demonstrated that there is a lot of innovation to play out in the space. But user experience is beginning to be acknowledged as vital to a project’s success. If DeFi is to truly go mainstream, society stands to benefit immensely.","Why did this happen?

When it comes to the estimated possibility of a 51% attack, while there's great news for some networks, several networks have a reason to be worried.

After recent attacks on Bitcoin Gold (BTG), we decided to re-visit both the vital discussion of 51% attack vulnerabilities*, and specific coins we have discussed previously in December 2018 and April 2019, to see how these have fared over the course of almost a year. Besides the eight previously discussed coins, we introduce two more interesting cases.

The results were quite representative of the realistic situation, one may say, as four of the listed ten coins have strengthened up, while the defense of the rest has dwindled since April last year. It goes to show that this is another pricey element of the Cryptosphere that can change quickly and that there's no time to rest in keeping the defense up against it.

As a reminder, a 51% attack happens when a person or a group gain the control of the majority of mining power on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain network, meaning that they can double-spend and reverse transactions, preventing other users from mining. It doesn't, however, allow the attackers to steal other's coins. While major distributed networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are safer due to their sheer size and are commonly a lot more expensive to attack, smaller networks have fewer participants and lack that layer of protection.

Here's how the theoretical costs of one hour attack have changed for some of the PoW coins since April 2019:

The 51% attack cost:

December 2018: USD 275,613

April 2019: USD 375,502

January 2020: USD 682,993

BTC price change in a year: +158%

Market capitalization: USD 164.1 billion

Bitcoin, standing at the top of the list, has made a major improvement of almost 82% since April, almost doubling the amount of money somebody would need to pay for an hour of attack, while NiceHash, a Slovenian cryptocurrency cloud mining marketplace, has but 1% of hash power to offer such a person. It's unknown if anybody could offer enough. A 51% attack is never impossible in theory, but the protection offered by the size of the network, and the price in combination with the lack of rentable hashing power, are a major deterrent in either case. Additionally, BTC is gearing up for the approaching halving in May. Meanwhile, two European mathematicians, Cyril Grunspan and Ricardo Pérez-Marco, calculated that double-spending an average BTC transaction is not profitable.

The 51% attack cost:

December 2018: USD 4,008

April 2019: USD 6,317

January 2020: USD 10,875

ETC price change in a year: +160%

Market capitalization: USD 1.2 billion

ETC is another interesting case. Though it sits in second place, NiceHash can offer 36% of the needed hash power if a villain decides to go for an attack. Nonetheless, this is still far less than 72% we noted back in April, so the overall improvement is noticeable. As mentioned last time, ETC suffered a 51% attack in January 2019.

The 51% attack cost:

December 2018: USD 7,896

April 2019: USD 22,322

January 2020: USD 26,422

BCH price change in a year: +221%

Market capitalization: USD 6.7 billion

Bitcoin Cash has been pushed down from the very top to the third place on the list. Though its improvement has been consistent since December 2018, it registered a 182% rise in April 2019, and then continued upwards at a slower pace since. NiceHash can offer 13% of the hashing power necessary for an attack, which is among the higher percentages on today's list, yet far from the highest. It's also noteworthy that last May two BCH mining pools, BTC.com and BTC.top, committed the 51% attack in an effort to stop an unknown miner from taking advantage of a bug and grabbing coins they weren’t supposed to even have access to following the code change. October also saw speculations that BCH may be under attack by an unknown miner.

The 51% attack cost:

December 2018: USD 3,851

April 2019: USD 4,460

January 2020: USD 5,227

DASH price change in a year: +65%

Market capitalization: USD 1.04 billion

Dash is another coin with a moderate, but constant improvement since December 2018. Additionally, only 7% is NiceHasha-ble. In July 2019, as promised, Dash activated a solution called ChainLocks in order to protect the network against 51% attacks.

The 51% attack cost:

December 2018: USD 75,390

April 2019: USD 94,112

January 2020: USD 89,894

ETH price change in a year: +59%

Market capitalization: USD 18.8 billion

While improving the attack cost 24% between December 2018 and April 2019, Ethereum saw a drop in the cost since April. But as Bitcoin's, Ethereum's strength also lies in its size, making it a lot more difficult for a dishonest player to seize control of it all. It doesn't mean that people will not try to though: in late December, the network was reportedly the target of a coordinated attack during ETH's Muir Glacier upgrade, and Parity issued new releases as protection. There have been warnings before that the entire network may be in danger due to certain vulnerable clients.

The 51% attack cost:

December 2018: USD 15,228

April 2019: USD 19,083

January 2020: USD 15,252

ZEC price change in a year: +11.7%

Market capitalization: USD 481 million

Following a 25% rise noted in April, Zcash hasn't shown any improvement since - what's more, it reverted to its December 2018 costs. That said, there is an improvement as NiceHash has even less hashing power to offer currently than several moths ago: 3% now, compared to 6% in April. Furthermore, there were no incidents reported throughout since the June 2018 attack on its algorithm Equihash, which had seen more than USD 550,000 double-spent from ZenCash at a cost of c. USD 30,000.

The 51% attack cost:

December 2018: USD 224

April 2019: USD 338

January 2020: USD 219

ETP price change in a year: -16.41%

Market capitalization: USD 26.7 million

Metaverse is another peculiar case we've been following. While showing a significant, 50% improvement in cost in April, it fell back below the December 2018 price. Furthermore, a villain has 1,708% available for rent on NiceHash, which is less than 1,338% reported in April, but a stunning number nonetheless. The team behind the coin announced last January that they'd be leaving PoW consensus algorithm for a hybrid called “Pillars of Creation,” deployed on the testnet at the time, reportedly followed by the mainnet a month later.

The 51% attack cost:

December 2018: USD 18,203

April 2019: USD 50,159

January 2020: USD 17,112

LTC price change in a year: +91%

Market capitalization: USD 3.8 billion

Standing among the winners just a few months ago, Litecoin has had a hard fall. Registering a 175% rise in cost in April, it is now not only in the negative, but the cost of an attack has fallen below the December 2018 one. Luckily for it, the hashing power available on NiceHash is 6% and it's not clear if there's somebody who could currently offer enough power for a successful grasp of the network. Importantly, Litecoin went through its second halving in August last year, which inevitably led to some miners shutting down their machines, switching to other coins, or investing in more powerful mining equipment.

The 51% attack cost, January 2020: USD 839

BTG price change in a year: +24%

Market capitalization: USD 205.2 million

We haven't discussed Bitcoin Gold in our previous articles of this kind. However, it's quite relevant for our discussion as it caught the eye of the public just a few days ago when it suffered two 51% attacks. The price of the coin rallied nonetheless. That said, NiceHash currently has a whopping 54% of the needed hash power to offer for the attack. The team behind the project confirmed that ""the hashpower for these attacks came through NiceHash.”

The 51% attack cost, January 2020: USD 7,978

RVN price change in a year: +134%

Market capitalization: USD 144.8 million

Our final coin is also an interesting one - it comes with a high price to pay for an attack, while NiceHach has no hashing power for the villains out there at the moment. The network experienced several attacks back in 2018, and a code change has been immediately proposed. It seems that there have been no incidents since. The hard fork, aimed at eliminating ASICs from the mining of the currency, took place in October.

________

* - calculations are based on the previous report by Cryptonews.com and information provided by a website called crypto51.app which tracks costs of these attacks and calculates how much of hashing power an attacker might rent from NiceHash, a Slovenian cryptocurrency cloud mining marketplace, to match the current network hashing power for an hour.

The Indian supreme court has finished hearing the crypto vs. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) case. The hearing concluded on Tuesday with the counsel for the Internet and Mobile Association of India wrapping up his arguments, followed by arguments by the counsel representing crypto exchanges. The judgment has been reserved.

IAMAI Concludes Arguments in Supreme Court

The supreme court of India resumed hearing the crypto vs. RBI case on Tuesday morning. The counsel for the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), Ashim Sood, picked up where he left off last week. He began by saying that there was no study showing that cryptocurrency affects monetary policy, local news platform Crypto Kanoon reported from the courtroom. Sood then brought up some previous cases to discuss the central bank’s power to take preemptive steps, reading out the RBI circular which bans banks from providing services to crypto businesses.

The IAMAI counsel pointed out that the circular has neither stopped crypto trading, or its use as a means of payment, nor cross-border transactions. Therefore, it does not address any of the central bank’s concerns. Sood asserted that the circular “was always intended to control consumer behavior and it seems to been failed even in this purpose,” Crypto Kanoon conveyed.

During the hearing, Justice Ramasubramaniam mentioned that Warren Buffett has made a negative statement regarding bitcoin, to which the counsel replied by showing an article where the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said he may have made a mistake by not investing in technology companies such as Apple and Google. Sood claims that if Buffett can make a mistake, why can’t the RBI? He then concluded his arguments.

Crypto Exchanges’ Counsel Concludes His Arguments

After the IAMAI counsel, Nakul Dewan, the counsel representing a number of crypto exchanges, began his arguments. He explained that cryptocurrency “should be seen from the perspective of its legal creation whereby it has characteristics of property but not by its use whereby it is akin to money,” the news portal detailed.

The counsel read out a few statements from other regulators, such as the U.K. Task Force, and submitted that crypto assets have the characteristics of property. He wrapped up his arguments after stating that the central bank’s arbitrary measure has indirectly shut down crypto exchanges’ businesses. The hearing then concluded.

A few hours after the hearing ended, the supreme court issued an order declaring that the judgment is reserved and the written submissions may be filed by Jan. 31. Furthermore, the court is set to hear the petitions relating to the country’s crypto policies after it has pronounced judgment on the RBI case.

On Jan. 14, at around 00:35 UTC, the price of BSV shot up 6 percent over a 10-minute period and 22 hours later, it was up a total of 139 percent from $196 to $458. A sell-off quickly followed BSV’s rally at around 00:30 UTC on Jan. 15, with the price dropping from $458 to $278. According to some analysts, the cryptocurrency is plagued by controversy and poor liquidity due to shallow order book depth.

The trust is said to be guarding pieces of the private keys necessary to unlock the bitcoin Wright and his former partner Dave Kleiman mined before 2014. Wright claims this is the $9.5 billion fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s founder.

“As it stands, a 300 percent move in a week is generally unsustainable,” Peters said of BSV.

Titled “Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision,” BSV has been embroiled in controversy since its early days, with major exchanges including Binance, Kraken and Shapeshift delisting the cryptocurrency , a move that has been contributing to increased volatility, Peters said.

“BSV is more vulnerable to major price swings due to a lack of depth of the order books in the smaller exchanges where it can be traded,” Peters said.

An order book refers to an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level. When there aren’t enough buyers or sellers on the books, illiquidity makes the assets more at risk to be manipulated by larger funds and investors.

BSV’s trading volume remains relatively thin compared to the others in the top 10 cryptocurrencies for the past 30 days. However, the standard deviation of returns — in other words, its volatility — has soared relative to the other nine leading cryptos. That signals that single orders in its shallow order books have a large impact on BSV’s price.

“Clearly the case,” said Alex Krüger, a prominent crypto trader and analyst, discussing BSV’s swift price rise and steep sell-off, saying that it was related to a lack of liquidity on the major exchanges.

But it’s not just the result of delisting the coin on many major exchanges. As Peters suggested, Wright’s recent court issues may have also caused a demonstrable effect on price movement.","Why did this happen?

The beginning of the new decade has seen Donald Trump play World War Three Chicken with Iran, Australia catch on fire amid dire climate forecasts, a US presidential impeachment trial, plagues of locusts devastate vast regions of Africa, and now the outbreak of a deadly virus from China.

For some cryptocurrency analysts and enthusiasts, moments of global crisis and geopolitical turmoil have become an opportunity to explain the notoriously volatile price of bitcoin.

The phenomenon has even inspired a popular meme, whereby a negative or seemingly unconnected event is arbitrarily attributed to the value of the cryptocurrency.

The 'This is good for bitcoin' theory states that during times of uncertainty, investors look to non-sovereign assets and currencies in order to safeguard their wealth.

For those that adhere to the belief that bitcoin is a safe-haven asset, it therefore may seem like no coincidence that its price has performed exceptionally well throughout the chaos of 2020, increasing its value by nearly a third since the start of the year.

Now, its price appears to be climbing in direct correlation with increasing fears over the global coronavirus epidemic.

Bitcoin has risen in price every day since Wuhan was placed under quarantine on 23 January, gaining nearly 10 per cent in value in less than a week. At around $9,000, it is currently trading at its highest level since November.

Other cryptocurrencies have also followed suit, with ethereum (ether), ripple (XRP) and bitcoin cash all experiencing considerable gains since the start of the outbreak.

""Prices jumped to near three-month highs following turbulence on traditional stock markets, reinforcing cryptocurrency's growing position as a possible safe haven investment,"" said Simon Peters, an analysts at the online trading platform eToro.

Similar conclusions were made earlier in January amid growing tensions between the US and Iran, as well as in August during the escalating trade war between the US and China.

Despite this, there is little research to actually support the theory that such events are related to bitcoin's fortunes. Market movements have instead been connected to developments within the cryptocurrency industry, such as favourable regulation being introduced, or rumours that a country is developing its own cryptocurrency.

Its value has also been pinned to the whims of traders who own large volumes of bitcoin, known as whales.

The tokens will be available in a Pokemon Go style app, called Socios, and give fans a direct voice in club decisions.

Football clubs catch blockchain fever

In one of the hottest new trends in professional sports, the Paris St. Germain Football Club (PSG) has just signed a deal with Socios, an app which will allow the club’s 78 million fans to participate and vote on decisions made by the team.

PSG is one of several teams to have signed a deal with Chiliz.net, a company based in Malta. Chiliz is the company behind the Socios app, which will allow users to find and also purchase the tokens in a Pokemon Go styled gamification of football fandom geared at die-hard fans.

La version Android est disponible sur Google Play tandis que la version BETA d'iOS peut être téléchargée à partir de notre site Web. 👉Android: https://t.co/4xKqRnN9wh

👉iOS: https://t.co/tAq4yVx0oE pic.twitter.com/lE29oecdHo — Socios.com (@socios) January 28, 2020

Other teams that Chiliz has signed include Juventus ($JUV), Atletico de Madrid ($ATM), A.S. Roma ($ASR), Galatasaray ($GAL) and West Ham United ($WHU). The initial launch will see 20 million PSG tokens issued, and they will have a price of £1.69.

The PSG crypto tokens, as well as the tokens for the other teams on the Chiliz roster, will be available to buy and sell on Chiliz.net starting in February. The PSG football club inked a 5 year deal with Socios, and expects to earn over £2 million pounds a year from the partnership.

Pro Sports around the world are dabbling in crypto

This PSG partnership with the Socios app, and the token launch, is reminiscent of the announcement of Arsenal FC’s deal with Cashbet two years ago. PSG’s token, however, will allow the team’s fans to decide things like where friendly matches are played and the design of the uniforms, giving them a utility that will draw fans in for a deeper experience, giving them a say through voting.

Professional football is just one sport that has embraced crypto tokens. The professional basketball team the Sacramento Kings has also launched a crypto-collectable in partnership with Consensys, and powered by Ethereum.

Major League Baseball has also jumped onboard and launched crypto-collectable baseball cards. These collectable MLB cards are described as CryptoKitties meet baseball, and will also be utilizing a smart contract based on Ethereum.

American Football Star and former Superbowl champion, Russell Okung, has been one of the most outspoken professional athletes to voice his support of crypto. He went viral after requesting to be paid in Bitcoin, and advocates frequently for the cryptocurrency.

In a more recent show of support, he wore BTCPay Server designed cleats on the field, in order to promote the open source Bitcoin payment processing project to his fans. He had the cleats custom-designed to promote the self-hosted Bitcoin payments app.

Crypto and sports may be the next big thing, and many pro sports clubs are already looking towards the best way to increase the excitement and bring fans one step closer to the action on the field. Crypto seems like an excellent way to add another dimension to the spectator experience.

In a Jan. 28, 2020 report, analytics firm Glassnode indicated that there are around 23 million entities holding Bitcoin. That represents a steady rise in adoption since the pioneer cryptocurrency was invented.

A Different Approach to Bitcoin

Despite the public nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, the question of how many people are using the cryptocurrency has always been difficult to answer. Recent analysis from Glassnode, however, provides some valuable insights.

Counting Bitcoin addresses has historically been the most commonly deployed approach to measuring Bitcoin users.

That method is limited by the twin problems of Bitcoin addresses that hold multiple users’ funds, such as exchange addresses, and users who control more than one address.

Lesser, more rudimentary methods based on educated guesses have also led to inconsistencies and inaccuracies when assessing the true number of users on the Bitcoin network.

For their part, Glassnode has developed an approach that maps multiple addresses to singular entities, thus solving some of the discrepancies mentioned above.

While they do not resolve the problem of exchange addresses, which hold Bitcoin for more than one person, their calculations paint a clear picture: Bitcoin usage is healthy and growing and always has been.

Measuring Adoption by Entity

By measuring new entities, former entities, and sending and receiving entities, the on-chain data and intelligence platform found that “as of January 2020 the number of entities holding Bitcoin is ~23.1 million.”

Importantly, those figures are almost 20% less than the number of addresses.

Glassnode found that the volatility observed when measuring addresses is not present when counting entities. That finding alone casts serious doubt on the viability of merely assessing Bitcoin usage by the number of addresses alone.

As the graph shows, (non-zero) address volatility is more pronounced than entity volatility.

In the bear market of 2018, for example, there was a clear spike leading up to it, followed by a severe drop off during the winter. That same pattern did not play out in the number of entities.

Findings Suggest Solid Long-term Growth

Bitcoin adoption, according to Glassnodes’ findings, has been consistently trending upwards for all of the cryptocurrency’s history. In fact, the analysts found that “there have been only 21 days so far in which the net entity growth was negative.”

The analysis also found that the seven largest Bitcoin entities, which hold around 13% of the supply of Bitcoin, were all exchanges.

These included Coinbase (983,800 BTC), Huobi (369,100 BTC), Binance (240,700 BTC), Bitfinex (214,600 BTC), Bitstamp (165,400 BTC), Kraken (132,100 BTC), and Bittrex (118,100 BTC). There are another 68 entities holding over 10,000 Bitcoin.

Whales aside, the findings demonstrate that, excluding a mere three weeks, the number of Bitcoin users has grown every day for over ten years.","Trading volumes in bitcoin options listed on the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt platform have completely dried up, even while CME’s options product is seeing strong interest.

As per Bakkt’s data, not a single bitcoin options contract was traded last week on Bakkt, with activity last registered on Jan. 17, when 20 lots had changed hands.

This is happening while the price of bitcoin has rallied to three-month highs, raising the cryptocurrency’s volatility.

Demand for options tends to rise with a spike in volatility, the standard deviation of an asset’s returns that is used as a measure of uncertainty. An options contract gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the specified amount of the underlying on or before the expiration date. A call option gives the holder a right to buy, while the put option gives the holder the right to sell.

New York-based Bakkt launched the first regulated bitcoin options contract on Dec. 9, having rolled out a cash-settled futures and physically settled futures November and September, respectively.

The physically delivered product, which went live on Sept. 24, was well received by the markets. Trading volumes quadrupled to $4.8 million in one month after launch, as noted by Bakkt Volume Bot, a Twitter account that tracks the exchange’s trades. The solid growth likely motivated Bakkt to offer option contracts on bitcoin.

CME versus Bakkt's bitcoin options volume Source: Skew

So far, however, the uptake for its options product has been weak. Bakkt traded a little over $1 million worth of options in the first four weeks since the launch on Dec. 9. The highest contract, worth $500,000, was initiated during the second week.

These numbers appear weak when compared to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) first-day options trading volume of $2.3 million. Trading activity on Bakkt has dwindled particularly since the launch of options on the CME. The CME listed options on Jan. 13, a month after Bakkt’s launch. Even so, the Chicago-based exchange is witnessing higher trading volumes; while Bakkt saw no activity last week, the CME traded 59 lots of options.

For now, institutional investors seem to be preferring CME over Bakkt, which isn’t surprising as the CME’s two-year-old bitcoin futures are among the most liquid derivative products in the cryptocurrency space.

While Bakkt futures witnessed a record trading volume of 6,600 contracts on Dec. 18, the CME futures registered an average daily volume of 6,400 in 2019. However, the difference is substantially more pronounced given that Bakkt’s contracts are for one bitcoin each while the CME futures’ contract size is five bitcoin.","ADVERTISEMENT

A crypto investor and technical strategist who predicted this month’s big Bitcoin rally says the king of crypto is targeting a long-term rise to $150,000.

On January 8th, when Bitcoin was trading around $8,000, the anonymous analyst known as Financial Survivalism said BTC appeared to be forming a classic Wycoff Spring pattern. The pattern is named after the late Richard Demille Wyckoff, whose method of analysis relies heavily on laws of supply and demand and divergences between volume and price.

Since then, Bitcoin has rallied to its current price of $9,384, with the analyst now identifying a potential cup-and-handle pattern – a formation often used to project a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal.

“Bitcoin just confirmed a cup and handle with today’s close. If it can reach its target of $11,675 then it would be the first higher high on the weekly in seven months. Breaking down the low of the handle ($8,100) would invalidate the pattern.”

The analyst believes BTC is at the outset of a long-term rally that will see the top cryptocurrency match its all-time high by July, and shatter $150,000 by the middle of 2022.

“I expect Bitcoin to retest all time highs by July of 2020. It will take some time to breakthrough that level but I fully believe we will before the end of the year. I also a holding onto my longer term target of $150,000 Bitcoin by May 2022.”

Meanwhile, analyst Josh Rager says BTC will likely retreat in the short term after moving far and fast this month. But he thinks “doom and gloom” calls predicting a major trend reversal are starting to get stale.

“Pullbacks should be expected, I’m fine with shorting, trading the range short term. But these doom and gloom calls get old, clearly Bitcoin broke the downtrend. For now, trading the range is fine.”

Featured Image: Shutterstock/Tithi Luadthong","Looking for the next Bitcoin (BTC, Rated ""A-"")?

Some people have long thought it would be Ethereum (ETH, Rated ""B+"").

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is more than just a payment system. It’s a platform for running an infinite variety of applications, called “smart contracts” or “distributed applications” (dApps). In fact, Ethereum aspires to be a worldwide computer capable of doing anything that a single, standalone computer can do, with two key differences: It’s everywhere, distributed all across the internet. And nobody owns it.

That was the Ethereum dream. But then began the Ethereum nightmare — a traffic jam of epic dimensions.

You see, due to Ethereum’s low capacity and slow speed — plus huge demand — the door was flung wide open to a host of wannabe Ethereum killers, all aspiring to replace it and become the new smart contract queen.

And now the big news …

The King Of Crypto Itself Could Become A Smart Contract Platform

We're talking about Bitcoin.

And we're referring to a new generation of Bitcoin developers that have appeared on the scene.

They’re hell bent on harnessing Bitcoin's first-mover advantage to muscle in on Ethereum's smart contract turf.

Their project is RSK (RBTC), and it has all the earmarks of becoming one of the toughest combatants in the smart contract war.

To be clear, RSK isn’t a run-of-the-mill upgrade to the Bitcoin blockchain. It's a whole new blockchain, designed as a sidechain that’s entirely dedicated to running smart contracts.

Think of a major highway strictly for moving (or storing) money. That’s Bitcoin. Then think of a parallel superhighway for doing everything else. That’s RSK. What about the miners? They’re the same as the Bitcoin miners. Plus, of course, it’s open to anyone with Internet access and a regular computer.

The major difference:

Bitcoin miners earn block rewards paid in newly-created Bitcoin (BTC).

RSK miners earn block rewards from fees earned from by RSK smart contract users. And they’re paid in RSK Bitcoins (RBTC).

A key reason it works: The RBTC and BTC are freely exchangeable one-to-one, anytime. In effect, RBTC is simply a form of Bitcoin used for running smart contracts.

Now, with this revolutionary change …

Bitcoin Owners Can Run dApps

Let’s say you’re among the millions who own Bitcoin.

Until now, all you could do is transfer it, spend it or hoard it.

But with the advent of RSK, all that changes. For the first time since Bitcoin was born, you can run Distributed Applications.

Or, let’s say you’re a Bitcoin developer. Without RSK, the things you could do were very narrowly confined. Now, you can use Bitcoin to build a myriad of applications.

Given the sheer size and volume of the Bitcoin network, we have little doubt RSK is going to be a hit.

And Decentralized Finance developers could be among the first to switch.

Why switch?

First, because RSK and Ethereum code have a lot in common. Some might say they’re virtually the same. So with RSK, anything currently running on Ethereum should run equally well on Bitcoin. It’s a relatively easy move.

Second, because of the collateral. Right now, DeFi apps that run on Ethereum use ETH for collateral. If they switch to Bitcoin, they will use BTC. Given the security, stability and size of Bitcoin, that’s a big advantage.

Right now, for example, a major Ethereum-project is DAI, a stablecoin with the potential to disrupt the way money works. DAI is currently backed by ETH, which most people know much less about. Imagine if it’s backed by the widely known (and owned) Bitcoin instead!

And think about what Bitcoin RSK could do for a peer-to-peer lending and borrowing platforms. If they switch to Bitcoin, they have the potential to gain almost instant credibility, greatly enhancing their chances for success.

End result. Someday, Bitcoin could emerge from its current, limited-use cases (mostly a store of value), and become the fuel for running smart contracts in what’s bound to become a fuel-thirsty market.

coincasso.com","During the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos last week, a number of panels featuring some key influential figures looked to address the growing trend of central bank digital currencies (CBDC).

Not only that, but Joseph Lubin, ConsenSys founder and one of the most important players in Ethereum, showcased a whitepaper entitled “Central Banks and the Future of Money” which presents a practical approach to developing central bank digital currencies.

The whitepaper provides guidance on how a CBDC could be designed and built on the Ethereum blockchain.

But what impact will CBDCs have on the overall cryptocurrency space? Do they represent a threat or are they an opportunity for Bitcoin and major altcoins to gain more traction and adoption?

Let’s take a look below.

Central bank digital currencies on the rise

The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) released a report a few days ago stating CBDCs are undergoing serious consideration by a great deal of central banks (CBs) around the world. The researchers concluded that:

“Globally, emerging market economies are moving from conceptual research to intensive practical development, driven by stronger motivations than those of advanced economy central banks. Central banks representing a fifth of the world’s population say they are likely to issue the first CBDCs in the next few years.”

It seems one of the most heated topics of 2020 will be the development of CDBCs as crypto enthusiasts fear their impact on cryptocurrencies.

On one hand, CBDCs could help spread digital cash to the unbanked, but they may also pose a threat to peer-to-peer, permissionless, and decentralised cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

For one, with the spread of digital cash backed by the government, physical cash will most likely disappear. In addition, users will need permission to use central bank digital currencies, so privacy will surely be affected.

Another issue is the impact CBDCs will have on fiat-to-cryptocurrency gateway coins.

Could central banks simply block the use of cryptocurrencies?

Do CBDCs pose a threat?

As an example of a potential issue that could arise with the use of CBDCs, let’s take a look at China’s credit score system.

I’ve discussed a similar issue here. Essentially, if enough points are subtracted off your credit score using the digital review system, you may lose the ability to trade with other individuals or travel to other locations.

Individuals in China are therefore intertwined with their credit score. This means that one unlucky move or word and you may find yourself blocked from interacting with your community.

How easy would it be for governments worldwide to adopt similar measures by implementing CBDCs?

It’s pretty straightforward in my opinion. As such, I’d argue that CBDCs are indeed a threat – not only to cryptocurrencies, but to individuals’ sovereignty as well.

CBDCs and crypto

One way to combat this of course is to hedge with cryptocurrencies. That way, if a centralised third party does decide it wants to control your funds, you at least won’t be completely cut off.

In my humble opinion, hedging against any government is (mostly) a smart move, especially in countries facing extreme hyperinflation.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top altcoins may help you secure and store value in the long term.

If there’s one thing CBDCs aren’t it’s cryptocurrency. As such, I believe it makes sense to possess unrelated assets in case there’s a storm.

Bitcoin's convincing breakout above the 200-day average overnight has opened the doors for a move to $10,000.

The weekly charts are also flashing strong bullish signals.

The case for a quick rise to $10,000 would weaken if prices drop below the 200-day average at 8,894 with strong volumes.

Bitcoin appears set to register its best January price gain in seven years and could soon rise into five figures.

The top cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $9,350 – a hefty 30 percent gain from the opening price of $7,160 observed on Jan. 1, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

If the gain is held through Jan. 31, it would be the best starting month to a year since 2013. Back in January 2013, bitcoin had rallied by 54 percent.

From 2015 to 2019, bitcoin has posted losses in January. The cryptocurrency now looks certain to snap that losing streak. The 30 percent rally is the second-best January performance on record.

Bitcoin picked up a strong bid at lows near $6,850 in the first week of this month and rose past $8,000, exiting a six-month-long downtrend. Notably, the breakout happened as the U.S. and Iran came close to war, forcing the analyst community to take note of the cryptocurrency’s strengthening safe-haven appeal.

Since then, we’ve seen a textbook bull move: a steady uptrend with regular low-volume pullbacks testing dip demand.

The price rise is in line with historical data showing the cryptocurrency hits a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a miner reward halving, but before the event, as discussed earlier this month.

With history looking to repeat itself, a further rise to levels above the June 2019 $13,880 before the May 2020 halving (supply-cutting event) cannot be ruled out.

For now, the technical charts do indicate scope for a move above the psychological resistance of $10,000.

Weekly chart

The falling channel breakout confirmed in the first week of January validated a bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-week moving averages (MAs) and opened the doors for a test of resistance at $10,350 (October high).

Supporting the bullish case are the ascending five- and 10-week MAs.

Additionally, the MACD histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change, while the relative strength index is on an upward trajectory and is reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 reading.

Daily chart

Bitcoin printed a UTC close above $9,188 (Jan. 19 high) on Tuesday, establishing a fresh higher high and signaling a continuation of the rally from the Jan. 3 low of $6,850.

More importantly, the move saw bitcoin cross the 200-day moving average (MA) with a positive “marubozu candle,” which comprises of little or no wicks and a strong body.

The candle indicates buyers remained in control during the 24-hour period and the cryptocurrency closed near the high point of the day. While bitcoin did see a minor pullback to $8.870 during the U.S. trading hours, the dip only ended up recharging the bulls for a strong move higher.

The positive marubozu candle indicates that bullish sentiment is strong – more so, in this case, as it shows buyers stepped without any hesitation despite prices trading close to 200-day MA, which acted as stiff resistance on Jan. 19.

Some investors may point out that bitcoin’s break above the 200-day MA in October turned out to be a bull trap. But back then the overall market sentiment was bearish, with the cryptocurrency trapped in a bearish channel on the weekly chart.

Overall, the broader trend is bullish, as noted. The stage now looks set for a quick move into five figures. Pullbacks cannot be ruled out, though, and the case for a quick rise to $10,000 would weaken if prices fall back below the 200-day MA at $8,894 on the back of a spike in trading volumes.

For the already initiated, there is a little spoken of land outside of crypto world where legions of normal people hear about Bitcoin and are interested, but don’t know where to begin. This is a problem considering the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed it as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system for anyone to use. Now that Bitcoin is in the news daily, and businesses and banks around the world are adopting the tech that supports it, it seems high time to better assist those interested in diving in.

What Is a Bitcoin?

With well over 5,000 different cryptocurrencies currently in existence, someone new to the scene might understandably be taken aback or even put off by the overwhelming amount of info surrounding digital assets. Luckily, the most popular cryptos aren’t so numerous, and the one that started it all, Bitcoin, is the focus of this article.

A breakdown of what Bitcoin is in simplest terms can be found in this resource from Bitcoin.com which states: “Bitcoin is a new type of digital money and, just like with all money, you can store it, exchange it, and make payments with it. However, unlike with traditional (fiat) currencies where payments are controlled by central banks, Bitcoin puts you in full control of your own money.”

The reason the holder of bitcoin is in control is thanks to a decentralized system that depends on math and open source code — not politicians, central servers or banks — to record, secure and enable transactions. When you have the private keys to your coins, nobody can take them. This is in stark contrast to a system like Paypal’s, for example, where the company can decide to withhold your funds or cancel a payment at will, with or without consent from the user.

Getting, Storing, and Spending Coins

The first step to getting into Bitcoin is having a basic understanding of what it is and what it can do. The second is to get your hands on some of it. As there are a couple “branches” of bitcoin (created by chain splits called forks) it is important to be familiar with the differences. For the purposes of this guide, however, the focus will be on Bitcoin Cash (BCH), referred to hereafter just as bitcoin, as it most closely adheres to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.

Getting and Securing a Wallet

Like traditional money, bitcoin must be stored somewhere, and requires a wallet. Crypto wallets are of course different from physical wallets that hold paper money and coins, but the concept is basically the same. There are mobile wallets and desktop wallets, as well as another variety called “cold storage.” It is highly important to make sure a wallet is non-custodial, meaning the user is in complete control of the funds, and not the wallet provider.

Once a newcomer to the crypto world has downloaded a non-custodial wallet, they’ll need to secure it. This is primarily done by backing up, writing down, or otherwise safely storing what is called a “seed phrase” or recovery phrase. A seed phrase is a string of words that can be used to restore your wallet if it is ever lost, and can be revealed in a wallet’s options or settings menu.

Let’s say someone takes their phone into the bathroom and drops the device into the toilet. Though the phone might be ruined, it doesn’t mean the bitcoin in the phone has been flushed. Once the person gets a new phone, they simply download the app again, and use the seed phrase to restore the wallet, complete with funds. The beauty of bitcoin is that the money is recorded on a distributed, encrypted ledger secured by multiple parties (blockchain), so the loss of one device doesn’t mean the loss of one’s cash.

Once a seed phrase is safely stored out of sight and in a secure place, the wallet should be locked so that a pin, password or fingerprint is required to open it. This is highly important as someone could pick up the phone and freely spend bitcoins if the phone and wallet are left unattended and unlocked.

Loading up on Bitcoin

A bitcoin neophyte can now begin loading their wallet with satoshis – the name for the smallest unit of bitcoin. There are several ways to acquire bitcoin. It can be purchased with a credit card, bought on an exchange, traded for privately, or even picked up in small amounts for free, via what is called a bitcoin faucet.

Crypto wallets send and receive money by way of bitcoin addresses. These are strings of characters that signify a wallet’s identity. A user’s public address can be shared with anyone in order to receive funds, and can also be represented as a QR code for easy transactions.

For example, in acquiring bitcoin via the Bitcoin Cash Faucet, the user is prompted in the final step to provide their bitcoin address. A good, reliable wallet will clearly show a user’s address when the “receive” or similar button is tapped in their wallet.

Every option for acquiring bitcoin mentioned above will require a wallet and an address. The video below demonstrates how QR code addresses are used to receive bitcoin as a shop owner in Venezuela accepts BCH from a customer:

Spending Your Coins

After all the right preparations have been made comes the fun part: spending bitcoin as peer-to-peer electronic cash for virtually anything and everything. Whether it is travel, charity, food, clothes, gift cards or anything in between, bitcoin can be used to get the job done. The Bitcoin Cash Map is a handy app that will show brick and mortar stores accepting bitcoin in your area.

The spending process is as easy as receiving. All that is needed is a merchant or other receiver’s address (in the form of a character string or QR code), and a tap or swipe of the send button after verifying the amount is correct. What’s more, crypto wallets keep track of your transactions for you, making record keeping and monitoring balances easy.

A lot of newbies to the exciting world of crypto start out by sending tiny amounts to a friend, or even to themselves via another wallet, just to get comfortable with the process. This can be a fun way to get a real feel for how bitcoin works. Though some crypto OGs, influencers, and talking heads on Twitter might seem aloof and out of reach on account of their next-level geekiness, it’s important to remember that they too were once new to crypto. As Bitcoin continues its rapid evolution from niche tech to peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world, you may just find yourself a “bitcoin OG” sooner than you think.

What got you interested in Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.","Cryptocurrency scammers raked in $4.3 billion worth of digital money in 2019, more than triple 2018’s haul. That’s according to the latest in a series of recent data drops by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, all of which it has included in a lengthy report it published Wednesday entitled “The 2020 State of Crypto Crime.”

You’ve got scams: Scammers exploit the fact that so many people are still fairly unfamiliar with cryptocurrency aside from its supposed “get rich quick” potential, according to Chainalysis. The various types of scams include fake token sales, blackmail scams, and fake services that promise to “mix” a user’s coins with those of others in order to make transactions harder to trace—only to run off with the money instead.

Predation by Ponzi: But according to the new report, Ponzi schemes are the elephant in the room. These scams, which entice unwitting people to invest in a phony enterprise and then dole out profits to earlier investors using the money that more recent investors have contributed, accounted for 92% of the stolen funds. Millions of people were defrauded.

The PlusToken fiasco: Chainalysis reports that a single Ponzi scheme based in China by itself brought in at least $2 billion last year, which would make it one of the biggest ever. PlusToken was a supposed cryptocurrency wallet service that promised users high returns if they used Bitcoin or Ethereum to buy the fake company’s own token, called Plus. An elaborate marketing campaign convinced more than three million people—the majority of whom were in China, Korea, and Japan—to invest by reaching them through the popular messaging platform WeChat, holding in-person meetups, and posting ads in supermarkets.

In June, Chinese authorities arrested six people alleged to have been behind the scam, but it appears that at least one still hasn’t been caught, since someone has continued to launder the funds and even cash some of them out.

Dirty laundry: Chainalysis says the PlusToken scammers have managed to cash out at least $185 million of stolen Bitcoin, but first they tried to cover their tracks by making 24,000 transfers and using 71,000 different Bitcoin addresses. Many of those transactions were executed via a special kind of wallet that uses a Bitcoin-compatible privacy technology called CoinJoin to combine the user’s transactions with others in a way that makes it difficult to tell who sent which payment to which recipient. Much of this money eventually found its way to so-called over-the-counter (OTC) brokers, independent entities that facilitate trades between individuals who don’t want to interact with a regulated exchange.

The PlusToken scammers weren’t the only criminals who took this route. Chainalysis concludes that the activity of a small subset of “rogue” OTC brokers providing crypto-money-laundering services “skyrocketed” in 2019. The authors warn: “Regulators need to be aware of how these scams function and how players like OTC brokers fit in so that they can craft more effective consumer protection laws.” In the meantime, keep your guard up.

Yet, in the white-hot cryptocurrency industry, lenders are burgeoning.

The Commerce Department reported Thursday that U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.1 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, on par with the third quarter’s clip, even after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times earlier in 2019 to stimulate growth. For the full year, the economy expanded 2.3 percent, a slowdown from 2018’s 2.9 percent, according to the report.

If there’s any softening in the economy, it hasn’t been felt by lenders like Genesis. The New York-based trading firm that lends cash alongside cryptocurrencies like bitcoin said Thursday in a report that loans increased by 21 percent during the fourth quarter to $545 million, driven by demand from big investors as well as aggregators of smaller loans in Asia and Europe.

Such growth was more than 10 times the pace at New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, where loan balances increased by 2 percent – roughly the same pace as the economy – during the period to $959.8 billion.

Only a few lenders can be found in the decade-old digital asset industry, and they are starting from a smaller base. There’s also a dearth of competition from established banks for loans to crypto traders and businesses, due to conservative risk-management policies and restrictions imposed by regulators. Since a cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be a highly volatile collateral for loans, more traditional lenders are rare.

But crypto lenders are seeing strong demand from borrowers who want loans denominated in bitcoin, cash or “stablecoins” – digital tokens like tether and USD Coin whose price is linked to the U.S. dollar or other government-issued currencies. And there are plenty of investors willing to pledge cash to lenders like Genesis in exchange for interest rates of 7 or 8 percent.

BlockFi, a big crypto lender backed by the investment funds Galaxy Digital and Winklevoss Capital, said earlier this month it planned to add five to 10 new assets to its platform, including the cryptocurrency litecoin and a dollar-pegged digital token, USD Coin. Later this year BlockFi plans to launch a credit card that offers rewards in bitcoin.

Celsius Network, another crypto lender, said in December large institutional clients were becoming an increasingly key contributor to the platform’s loan growth.

“Obviously the crypto sector is not even a beauty mark right now compared with the banking sector, in terms of the size and maturity,” Genesis CEO Michael Moro said in a phone interview. “But there is rapid growth in this new market, and it’s not just us. There are other companies trying to accomplish similar things.”

Genesis is controlled by the crypto-focused investment firm Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.

Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, surged 94 percent in 2019, more than three times the gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks over the period.

So far in January, bitcoin is up another 30 percent to about $9,300, the best start to a year since 2013. Earlier this month, the professional-network website LinkedIn named blockchain – the cryptographically-enabled computer-network technology underpinning cryptocurrencies – as the most in-demand skill among employers.

Silvergate Capital, one of the few banking companies serving crypto-related businesses, said Wednesday total assets were flat in the fourth quarter at $2.13 billion. But the La Jolla, California-based publicly traded company said it added 48 digital currency customers during the period, bringing the total to 804, while transactions on its digital Silvergate Exchange Network rose by 17 percent from third-quarter levels.

A recently announced initiative at Silvergate will allow customers to obtain U.S. dollar-denominated loans collateralized by bitcoin.

Genesis said in its latest report a new source of demand for cash loans in 2020 could come from “mining” companies that need capital to build, expand or upgrade data centers used to process transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.","Silvergate Bank is venturing even further into a field where few financial institutions dare to tiptoe.

The La Jolla, Calif., lender made a name for itself providing hard-to-come-by U.S.-dollar banking services for businesses that deal in cryptocurrency. But now Silvergate wants to handle digital assets themselves.

While the bank has no such services on its roadmap yet, it has applied for the New York trust license with the aim of providing custody and settlement for crypto. One example of this might look like “providing settlement services for their bitcoin trades,” Silvergate CEO Alan J. Lane said.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

In this scenario, Silvergate would be the intermediary ensuring settlement of a fiat-for-bitcoin exchange between two participants on its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a payments platform that allows commercial customers to instantly move U.S. dollars between crypto exchanges.

“In order for us to be able to be that trusted intermediary, we have to be able to touch the digital assets ourselves,” Lane said. “Think about it as if Silvergate also had the ability to be the SEN for bitcoin.”

The service, almost certainly the first of its kind offered by a U.S. commercial bank, wouldn’t apply to retail investors or institutional investors that are already comfortable with bitcoin as an asset class.

“It’s folks that aren’t quite ready to be in the business, and part of the reason is because this doesn’t exist,” Lane said, emphasizing the bank doesn’t yet have a product in mind to solve the problem. “Our current customers, they’ve already figured out a way to get comfortable with this, but they tell us there are other counterparties out there that they’re not yet doing business with because they don’t have a trusted way to settle.”

Lane spoke to CoinDesk Wednesday after Silvergate’s first conference call as a publicly traded company. Earlier in the day it had reported fourth-quarter results, including a 6 percent increase in crypto clients and a 4 percent decrease in deposits from those clients.

Coming soon

Silvergate Bank’s 2020 will be characterized by staff getting the bank’s bitcoin-collateralized margin lending running well and solving other pain points in the digital asset industry, Lane said.

Salary expenses climbed nearly 6 percent from a year earlier to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter. The majority of this went toward customer service and software engineers, Lane said when asked what share of the expenses was from compliance costs.

The bank does spend money on compliance, of course: Silvergate uses both Chainalysis and Elliptic, Lane said. These vendors analyze the public blockchains to flag suspicious activity, which banks are required under Federal Reserve regulations to report.

With $2.1 billion in assets, Silvergate is a relatively small institution, 0.07 percent the size of JPMorgan. The asset side of its balance sheet looks like a traditional community lender, composed mainly of real estate loans. But that may start to evolve soon.

In the immediate future, Silvergate’s biggest focus is its pilot of the SEN Leverage product, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans they can then use to buy more bitcoin.

Since the 90-to-180-day pilot will include only SEN participants, the bank will be able to monitor SEN Leverage loans more closely than it could other types of loans.

“We will be able to monitor the loan, the collateral underlying the loan and the balance of the loan, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Lane said. “We’ll be able to monitor this much more closely than we can monitor just about any other loan we make.”

In response to questions from analysts in the company’s earnings call about yield on SEN loans, Lane said, “The way we’ve thought about this initially is this would likely be a high single-digit type of cost to the borrower.”

In the interview, Lane emphasized the bank wouldn’t take advantage of crypto customers on SEN loans just because other banks aren’t offering the same product. “We’re certainly not going to poke their eyes out on what we’re charging them,” Lane said.

Silvergate is also working to increase the number of fiat currencies it supports for foreign exchange transactions on the SEN to include at least the top five to 10 major global currencies. From fourth-quarter 2018 to fourth-quarter 2019, volume on the SEN increased by 150 percent to an all-time high of 14,400 transactions handling $9.6 billion.

“Our customers are saying, ‘We’d love to have the SEN for the euro and the SEN for the yen,’” Lane said. “That involves having correspondent banking relationships with banks in those areas where those currencies are predominant and then being able to create a similar type of network as to what we’ve created with the SEN.”

Dry powder

Taking Silvergate public has given the crypto industry a clearer window into the bank’s business. It also positions Silvergate to more easily raise capital should the need arise.

Currently, Silvergate has a 10.5 percent leverage ratio, meaning the bank has more than twice the amount of capital required by banking regulators (5 percent).","A new cryptocurrency-routing scheme co-invented by MIT researchers can boost the efficiency — and, ultimately, profits — of certain networks designed to speed up notoriously slow blockchain transactions.

Cryptocurrencies hold promise for peer-to-peer financial transactions, potentially making banks and credit cards obsolete. But there’s a scalability issue: Bitcoin, for instance, processes only a handful of transactions per second, while major credit cards process hundreds or thousands. That’s because the blockchain — the digital ledger cryptocurrencies are built on — takes a really long time to process transactions.

A new solution is “payment channel networks” (PCNs), where transactions are completed with minimal involvement from the blockchain. Pairs of PCN users form off-blockchain escrow accounts with a dedicated amount of money, forming a large, interconnected network of joint accounts. Users route payments through these accounts, only pinging the blockchain to establish and close the accounts, which speeds things up dramatically. Accounts can also collect a tiny fee when transactions get routed through them.

Inefficient routing schemes, however, slow down even these fast solutions. They deplete users’ balances in these accounts frequently, forcing them to invest a lot of money in each account or frequently rebalance their accounts on the blockchain. In a paper being presented next month at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, the researchers introduce “Spider,” a more efficient routing scheme that lets users invest only a fraction of funds in each account and process roughly four times more transactions before rebalancing on the blockchain.

“It’s important to have balanced, high-throughput routing in PCNs to ensure the money that users put into joint accounts is used efficiently,” says first author Vibhaalakshmi Sivaraman, a graduate student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). “This should be efficient and a lucrative business. That means routing as many transactions as possible, with as little funds as possible, to give PCNs the best bang for their buck.”

Joining Sivaraman on the paper are former postdoc Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan, CSAIL graduate students Parimarjan Negi and Lei Yang, and Mohammad Alizadeh, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and a CSAIL researcher; Radhika Mittal of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Kathleen Ruan and Giulia Fanti of Carnegie Mellon University.

Packet payments

PCNs rely heavily on bidirectional joint accounts — where both parties can receive and send money — so money can be routed between any users. User B can have a joint account with user A, while also linking separately to user C. Users A and C are not directly connected, but user A can send money to user C via the A-B and B-C joint accounts.

To exchange funds, each party must approve and update the balances in their joint accounts. Payments can only be routed on channels with sufficient funds to handle the transactions, causing major issues.

Traditional schemes send transactions along the shortest path possible, without being aware of any given user’s balance or the rate of sending on that account. This can cause one of the users in the joint account to handle too many transactions and drop to a zero balance, making it unable to route further transactions. What’s more, users can only send a payment in full. If a user wants to send, say, 10 bitcoins, current schemes try to push the full amount on the shortest path possible. If that path can’t support all 10 bitcoins at once, they’ll search for the next shortest path, and so on — which can slow down or completely fail the transaction.

Inspired by a technique for internet communications called packet switching, Spider splits each full transaction into smaller “packets” that are sent across different channels at different rates. This lets the scheme route chunks of these large payments through potentially low-funded accounts. Each packet is then far more likely to reach its destination without slowing down the network or being rejected in any given account for its size.

“Shortest-path routing can cause imbalances between accounts that deplete key payment channels and paralyze the system,” Sivaraman says. “Routing money in a way that the funds of both users in each joint account are balanced allows us to reuse the same initial funds to support as many transactions as possible.”



All queued up

Another innovation was creating queues at congested accounts. If an account can’t handle incoming transactions that require it to send money, instead of rejecting them, it queues them up. Then, it waits for any transactions that will replenish its funds — within a reasonable time frame — to be able to process those transactions.

“If you’re waiting on a queue, but I send you funds within the next second, you can then use any of those funds to send your waiting transactions,” Sivaraman says.

The researchers also adopted an algorithm — built by Alizadeh and other researchers — that monitors data center congestion to identify queueing delays at congested accounts. This helps control the rate of transactions. Say user A sends funds to user C through user B, which has a long queue. The receiver C sends the sender A, along with the payment confirmation, one bit of information representing the transaction’s wait time at user B. If it’s too long, user A routes fewer transactions through user B. As the queueing time decreases, account A routes more transactions through B. In this manner, by monitoring the queues alone, Spider is able to ensure that the rate of transactions is both balanced and as high as possible.

Ultimately, the more balanced the routing of PCNs, the smaller the capacity required — meaning, overall funds across all joint accounts — for high transaction throughput. In PCN simulations, Spider processed 95 percent of all transactions using only 25 percent of the capacity needed in traditional schemes.

The researchers also ran tests on tricky transactions called “DAGs,” which are one-directional payments where one user inevitably runs out of funds and needs to rebalance on the blockchain. A key metric for the performance of PCNs on DAG transactions is the number of off-chain transactions enabled for each transaction on the blockchain. In this regard, Spider is able to process eight times as many off-chain transactions for each transaction on-chain. In contrast, traditional schemes only support twice as many off-chain transactions.

“Even with extremely frequent rebalancing, traditional schemes can’t process all DAG transactions. But with very low-frequency rebalancing, Spider can complete them all,” Sivaraman says.

Next, the researchers are making Spider more robust to DAG transactions, which can cause bottlenecks. They’re also exploring data privacy issues and ways to incentivize users to use Spider.","On January 13, pop singer Akon confirmed via tweet that his 2,000-acre, cryptocurrency-powered city in Senegal would soon break ground. The project was first announced in 2018, and the smart city will rise near the capital of Dakar, on a plot gifted to Akon by President Macky Sall.

Just finalized the agreement for AKON CITY in Senegal. Looking forward to hosting you there in the future pic.twitter.com/dsoYpmjnpf — AKON (@Akon) January 13, 2020

Oh, and Akon City will run on ‘AKoin,’ a proprietary cryptocurrency, as a trial run for whether digital currency can be better integrated into Africa as a whole.

The new city is being pitched as sustainable, and when complete in 10 years, will be the first LEED-certified project in Africa. Because the project is being touted as a tourism city, SAPCO, the state-owned tourism agency, is co-developing the project with Akon.

While the designer for Akon City hasn’t been announced yet, from the renderings, the aesthetic seems to borrow heavily from the biomorphic, parametrically-designed structures found in other smart city proposals. At the heart of the development will be two sculptural, interlocking towers with a large void between them, reminiscent of Zaha Hadid Architects’ recent work in Beijing. A large manmade lake and promenade will front a curvy center and will join undulating glass tower complexes. While concrete details about the city’s makeup are sparse, the project will reportedly feature a mixture of residential and commercial areas.

According to CNN, Akon City is only a five-minute drive from Senegal’s new international airport, which opened in 2017. The project is being rolled out in phases, with the second phase set to begin in 2025.

While it may seem far-fetched, integrating blockchain technology into city building has been gaining traction in recent years—though none of the projects have been successfully realized yet. Tom Wiscombe Architecture and Ehrlich Yanai Rhee Chaney Architects (EYRC) are designing a 100-square-mile city powered by Bitcoin-competitor Ethereum in the Nevada Desert, and The Orbit in Ontario is expanding a town that was an early adopter to cryptocurrency into a full-fledged smart city.","Bank Frick Expands Range of Crypto Assets to Offer Trading and Custodian Services for Bitcoin Cash

Bank Frick, a leading European blockchain bank, has expanded its range of cryptocurrencies for which it offers trading and custodian services. Bank Frick now offers trading and secure custody of bitcoin cash (BCH) for professional market participants and wealthy private clients. Trading takes place within the fully regulated environment of the bank.

The company announced the news Thursday, saying it has obtained digital asset insurance that will protect users’ holdings in cases of “external theft and internal collusion.”

Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara said the cover, which has a limit of up to $300 million, offers “peace of mind” and would show clients the exchange is “committed to prioritizing security throughout all of our decisions and forward-looking blockchain technologies.”

The insurance was underwritten by Arch Syndicate 2012, which provides specialized insurance for corporations. The policy was approved after the exchange demonstrated its internal security and compliance protocols, and was supported by other syndicates based out of Lloyd’s of London, one of the world’s largest insurance markets.

The term “external theft” is likely to mean a theft via a physical intrusion into Bittrex’s crypto vault, as cold wallets are not generally vulnerable to hacking. The cover is a tailored version of Arch’s Blue Vault, which provides limits of up to $150 million and covers the loss of digital assets due to internal and external theft (via direct access to the storage media) and also includes employee collusion.

CoinDesk has contacted the exchange to clarify the cover more precisely.

Sarah Downey, the co-leader of the Digital Asset Risk Transfer (DART) team at Marsh, the insurance broker that assisted Bittrex in drawing up the policy, said: “Insurance plays a critical role in the growth and development of any business, including those that work with blockchain technology and digital assets.”

Insurance coverage is a growing trend among businesses that hold users’ cryptocurrency. Custodial solution KNØX has insurance, also from Lloyd’s, which covers losses of up to $100 million. The Winklevoss brothers created their own insurance company earlier this month to guarantee losses up to $200 million for Gemini exchange users.

Coinbase previously held the record for the largest insurance coverage in crypto, insuring against third-party attacks of up to $255 million for digital assets held in the exchange’s hot wallets. With Bittrex’s news this week, the bar has been raised by a cool $45 million.","In the first installment of this two-part commentary, we’ll explain why custodian solutions are not in the spirit of the cryptocurrency revolution.

“Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins”

You should’ve already heard these words of advice from cryptocurrency veterans. Keys, i.e., private keys, sign, and confirm transactions. If you don’t own the private key, the bitcoins associated with it are not yours.

That’s why it’s not recommended to leave coins on an exchange unless you are actively trading them. While exchanges may be a straightforward way to store your coins, it doesn’t take much effort to HODL using open source software and procedures.

As an alternative to banking, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network that transfers value without third parties. Yet, some of the same intermediaries in the financial sector (such as custodians) are being replicated in the cryptocurrency industry.

Custodians want to keep your bitcoins safe for you, but their business model goes against the purpose of cryptocurrency. To enable individual sovereignty and financial privacy. Custodians take these away from the user.

How Does Crypto Custody Work?

The custody of crypto-assets is a unique issue as it involves both cryptography and cybersecurity. In traditional markets, central security depositories use electronic record keeping to manage assets under a bank’s custody. Once securities became dematerialized, the role of a custodian bank turned into an administrative service (rather than safeguarding a paper certificate).

But with cryptocurrencies, the problems of physical safe-keeping return. Which raises the question, what entities should assume this role, given the required expertise in public-key cryptography and blockchain technology?

Transactions on the Bitcoin network rely on public-key cryptography. Public keys generate addresses while a corresponding private key signs transactions. You must not share the private key with anyone to ensure no one else can access your funds. Possession of the private key establishes ownership of the funds that the key controls, making bitcoin a bearer asset.

The traditional definition of custody (i.e., holding something of yours, on your behalf) does not apply to crypto-assets. Once you share your private key or delegate some form of control, it means that the custodian owns that bitcoin too.

The Drawbacks of Crypto Custodians

The business of cryptocurrency custody is moving along slowly. Fidelity has shown interest in cryptocurrency for years now, but have only rolled their custody service in October 2019. Despite the care and effort put in place by custodians with passwords, vaults, and precautions, there is no way of assessing the security of private keys from internal and external threats.

Also, there is a conflict between keeping private keys secure and auditing a custodian’s crypto-assets. This is a problem unique to cryptocurrency because of its reliance on public-key cryptography to denote ownership. It remains to be seen how the regulatory requirements (such as surprise audits) and safeguarding of these assets will be reconciled. Because of the lack of regulatory oversight on cryptocurrency custodians, we do not know what the security features mean in practice or how legitimate their services are.

It is also uncertain how custodians will mitigate adviser fraud and mismanagement because of the practical complexities involved in securing bearer assets like private keys. As a result, no regulator can stamp out this type of fraud completely. The centralization of power and influence is a major concern with crypto-custody solutions, and we’ll detail this more below.

Centralization of Power

Many of the exchanges offering custody solutions already hold a significant amount of the supply of bitcoin. For example, a massive migration in December 2018 saw Coinbase move five percent of all circulating bitcoin (at the time), along with eight percent of all ether and 25 percent of all Litecoin.

Cryptocurrency custody services give exchanges even more influence over the supply of crypto-assets. Custody providers that operate other business lines may abuse their position. What’s stopping exchanges from using their own custody services to cross-subsidize their other business lines?

The threat of reputational damage, but it is not impossible that custodians may act in this way.

If we look at custodians in traditional finance, we see that some have failed before. BNY Mellon’s custodian arm failed to protect their client’s assets in 2015, mixing them with the bank’s own or borrowing money from one client’s account to pay another.

As institutional interest in cryptocurrency develops, hackers will start testing the security models of custodians. If a handful of these businesses store a large number of coins, it becomes a point of failure for Bitcoin. A breach of their security systems may mean that a group of hackers ends up having a large influence on the price of bitcoin.

No custodian will want to face being the first to deal with a hack. It will happen – it’s better that retail traders avoid this risk completely.

In the second installment, we’ll explain further how custody is opposed to the purpose of cryptocurrency and give you practical tips on an alternative to third-party custodians."

Bitcoin's January surge has put the bulls in the driver's seat, opening the doors for a continued rally into five figures.

A minor pullback to $9,000 could be seen in the next 24 hours or so, with intraday indicators are flashing bearish signals.

The overall bull bias will remain intact as long as prices are holding above recent lows near $8,200.

Bitcoin is holding its bullish trend while heading into the historically strong month of February.

The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid below $7,000 on Jan. 3 and has been on an upward trajectory ever since, rising to three-month highs near $9,570 on Thursday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

At the current price of $9,350, bitcoin is up 30 percent on a month-to-date basis – its best January performance since 2013.

Additionally, the cryptocurrency is on track to register a double-digit monthly gain for the first time since June 2019, when prices had rallied by 26 percent. January’s 30 percent rally is its best monthly performance since May 2019.

This month’s rally marks a sharp reversal higher from a six-month downturn when prices collapsed from $13,880 to $6,425. With the bulls still leading the price action, February may again turn out to be a good month for the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin has eked out gains in February for the last five years.

February saw losses in just two of the last eight years.

The popular narrative for February’s good record is Chinese investors tend to liquidate their crypto holdings ahead of the New Year holiday in January and reinvest in February, causing prices to rise.

This time, however, the supposed post-holiday reinvestments may be delayed due to coronavirus outbreak, leading to a weakening of the bullish momentum.

That said, the bitcoin market is currently showing no signs of bull fatigue. “It’s difficult to have a bearish argument,” popular trader and analyst @filbfilb tweeted on Thursday.

The analyst is drawing attention to the monthly chart, where the MACD histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

The bullish bias will strengthen if prices print a monthly close (Friday, UTC) above $9,158, establishing a higher high.

The shorter duration charts are also reporting a strong bullish bias.

Weekly chart

Bitcoin has broken out of a falling channel, indicating a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,100 observed in early April 2019.

The breakout is backed by bullish readings on both the MACD histogram and the relative strength index.

The weekly chart is aligned in favor of a rally toward $10,350 (October high).

Daily chart

While the daily candle is red, the losses may be reversed later today as the odds are stacked in favor of the bulls.

Bitcoin defended the former resistance-turned-support of $9,188 on Thursday with a bullish engulfing candle. That solidified the preceding day’s breakout above that level and signaled a continuation of the rally from $8,213 (Jan. 24 low).

Momentum is still strong, as suggested by the ascending five- and 10-day averages.

The cryptocurrency could test and possibly break above resistance at $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) and rise toward $10,000 over the next few days.

4-hour chart

The RSI has produced lower highs or bearish divergence on the four-hour chart. As a result, a quick pullback to $9,000 cannot be ruled out before the move into five figures suggested by the daily and weekly charts.

The bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $8,213. The odds of bitcoin falling all the way back to levels below $8,000 are quite low, according to renowned analyst Josh Rager.","Ethereum’s Value Transfer Is Now Dominated by Stablecoins

The Ethereum (ETH) blockchain has become home to a number of stablecoins. On January 29, Messari researcher Ryan Watkins explained that the stablecoin value transfer issued on the ETH chain recently flipped the number of native ether transactions. Essentially, Ethereum’s value transfer is now largely made up of stablecoins like tether, pax, and dai.

Researcher: ‘Ethereum’s Economy Now Dominated by Stable Value Transfer’

On Wednesday, Messari analyst Ryan Watkins reported on the Ethereum blockchain and how the ETH economy is now dominated by stablecoins. The ETH chain has a great number of stablecoins such as TUSD, USDT, DAI, PAX, and GUSD. All five of these stablecoins leverage the ETH chain for stable value transfers. “Stablecoin transfer value has now flipped ETH on Ethereum,” Watkins tweeted. While sharing another chart, Watkins indicated that most of the story is consumed by tether (USDT) transitioning to Ethereum last year. Watkins believes the flippening took place in mid-2019 and emphasized that since then “Ethereum’s economy is now dominated by stable value transfer.”

During the last week of August 2019, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the significant migration of tether from the Omni Layer network to Ethereum. At the time, ERC20 tether transactions flipped their Omni equivalent. The stablecoin tether is a $4.6 billion dollar network and all the coins are issued and maintained on chains like BTC (Omni), ETH (ERC20), EOS, and Tron. After the significant migration into the ERC20 standard, a majority of the USDT in circulation stems from the ETH chain. Additionally, researchers have noted that 70% of the circulating tether supply is controlled by roughly 104 addresses. Following Watkins’ tweet about stablecoins flipping the chain’s native currency ether, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) commented on the topic.

“Many of us (early adopters) don’t like stablecoins,” CZ tweeted. “But [the] fact is, that’s what’s needed to help us cross the chasm, as most new crypto people will still think in fiat base for a while to come. I wish that’s not the case, but we live on earth, not utopia.”

One person disagreed with CZ and said that certain stablecoins will likely remove revenue from trading platforms. “Very hypocritical — I totally agree with you about centralized stablecoins like Paxos – Binance USD or USDC,” the individual wrote. “[But] how about crypto — collateralized ones like DAI? The truth is that [decentralized finance] apps, like Uniswap, [and] Makerdao take away a lot of revenue from exchanges like Binance,” he added. However, the Binance founder said he wasn’t worried about that situation and stated:

The more choices for users, and the more innovation for the industry, the better for all of us. Don’t worry about Binance, we will manage — We are adaptable.

Stablecoins and Exchange Tokens Outshine 2017-2018 ICO Tokens That Used Ethereum’s ERC20 Standard

Another crypto proponent agreed with CZ’s assessment and said: “That’s usually how new tech and ideas are adopted. The present generation needs one foot on the old and one on the new at the same time to feel safe and be familiarized in their new surroundings.” Out of the five stablecoins maintained on the ETH chain, tether USDT is by far the most dominant. This is followed by Circle’s USDC, Makerdao’s DAI, Pax Global’s PAX, True USD (TUSD), and Gemini’s GUSD.

Today, @RyanWatkins_ reported that transfer value of stablecoins on ethereum has surpassed that of $ETH. Token transfers as a whole have been happening with higher frequency on ethereum than non-token transfers. These are both signs $ETH is proving more utility than currency. pic.twitter.com/cAt4hfqBLU — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 29, 2020

At the time of publication, 2.29 billion USDT is represented by ERC20 tokens and there are 439 million USDC tokens housed on the ETH chain as well. In addition to all the stablecoin value held on Ethereum, a great number of exchange tokens leverage the chain. For example, exchange tokens like BNB, LEO, HT, CRO, OKB, and KCS just scratch the surface when it comes to exchange-created coins hosted on the ETH chain. Stablecoins and exchange tokens are the most used ERC20s today by a long shot, and they have surpassed most of the initial coin offering (ICO) ERC20s issued in 2017-2018. Observers like Watkins and others have asked whether “it is good for ETH or does it damage ETH’s monetary premium?” Watkins further discusses this topic in his latest research analysis hosted on the Messari website.

In a Friday blog post, Kraken claimed that hackers can possibly exploit voltage glitching and extract encrypted seeds from the Trezor One and Trezor Model T wallets with only 15 minutes of physical access to the device.

Trezor has been aware of this vulnerability since designing the products, the post contended. Before publicly announcing the security flaw, Kraken in Oct. 2019 revealed details of the attack to Trezor. Ledger’s security team, Ledger Donjon, also conducted similar research last year.

According to Kraken Chief Security Officer Nick Percoco, the flaw is an inherent to the microcontroller used in Trezor's wallets, which is why the vulnerability persists despite Trezor's knowledge of it.

""It's a flaw that's present in the hardware, not something they can just put a formal update on and fix it for all their customers,"" he told The Block. ""To address this problem, they would essentially need to put out a new device.""

Following Kraken's blog post, Trezor cited in a tweet its official response to Ledger’s research dated Mar. 2019. According to the response, the attack cannot happen remotely and will not work if users turn on the BIP 39 passphrase.

""Physical access is a threat to 6-9% of people, according to our research,"" Trezor said in a subsequent tweet. ""If a physical access is a part of someone's threat model, we advice to use a Passphrase feature. But again, physical access is not a widespread case.""

Percoco confirmed Trezor's claims. ""We would not have been able to perform this attack if there were a BIP 39 passphrase, but unfortunately, the passphrase is an optional addition that not all users enable,"" he said. "" So the real recommendations here are, one, make sure that you are controlling physical access to your Trezor wallet, and, two, add that that additional passphrase to the wallet.""

Kraken previously performed a similar attack against the KeepKey wallet. In light of the two sets of research, Kraken concluded in the blog post that ""these chips are not designed to store secrets and... vendors like Trezor and KeepKey should not solely rely on them to secure your cryptocurrency.""

Percoco said Kraken decided to make the announcement in order to bring awareness to this kind of vulnerability.

""This is for our clients and for the users within the Bitcoin community to be aware that they need to take the additional precautions when using a hardware wallet to ensure that their seeds are protected,"" he said.","Bitcoin has experienced a remarkably strong start in 2020. Analysts believe it could be a blockbuster year for Bitcoin and for the crypto market in general. In January, the Bitcoin market gained steam and has finally broken through the level of $9,000 for the first time in 2020.

On the wave of bullish crypto market sentiment, now seems like a great time to start investing in Bitcoin. Let us figure out how and where to buy Bitcoin and store it safely.

How to buy Bitcoin

There are a few clear steps you should take before purchasing Bitcoin for the first time. Once you are ready, you can learn to buy Bitcoin in no time, as simply as using any other mobile app on your phone.

Step 1. How to buy BTC: choose a trustworthy Bitcoin trading app

There is a whole bunch of crypto exchanges out there with different performance and levels of credibility. You should focus on an award-winning and regulated crypto exchange. With Currency.com you can buy, sell and hold your crypto assets safely.

An online crypto exchange is a marketplace that operates similarly to platforms that traders use to buy stocks. The BTC exchange connects you directly to the Bitcoin marketplace, where you can exchange traditional fiat currencies for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin exchanges resemble Forex markets. These are digital platforms where you can exchange BTC to USD, BTC to EUR, BTC to GBP or choose any other crypto-to-fiat currency pair.

Although the crypto exchange serves as a one-stop solution compliant with the most stringent security standards and AML rules, you should note that it is not recommended to store large amounts of Bitcoins on your account for a long time. While the in-built wallets are secure enough to ensure smooth trading, it is advisable to transfer your crypto holdings to an external wallet.

This leads us to the next step of our journey – choosing a Bitcoin wallet. Experts believe you should stick to the one with a multi-signature facility.

Step 2. How to buy Bitcoin safely: choose the right wallet.

Since Bitcoins are not literally coins they need a special place to be kept securely. You should choose a digital wallet to store your Bitcoin holdings until you are ready to spend them or exchange to another currency.

The major challenge is to choose a crypto wallet you can trust. Crypto wallets operate through private and public keys, which represent long strings of numbers and letters, created through a mathematical encryption algorithm.

Public key works as a location where Bitcoin transactions are deposited to and withdrawn from. These keys appear on the Blockchain ledger as a user’s digital signature.

works as a location where Bitcoin transactions are deposited to and withdrawn from. These keys appear on the Blockchain ledger as a user’s digital signature. Private key is a password necessary to buy, sell and trade the Bitcoin in a wallet. This key should be protected and used only to authorise Bitcoin transactions.

Some traders prefer to encrypt a Bitcoin wallet with a strong password, and in some cases choose a cold storage option.

What exactly do we mean by saying a 'cold' and 'hot' wallet? In-built or ‘hot’ wallets offered by some exchanges are regarded as more agile and safe for exchanging crypto to fiat. Although they guarantee the highest level of security for clients’ assets, they still incur some external risks.

That is why many traders stick to offline or ‘cold’ wallets, when it comes to storing significant amounts of crypto assets. Cold wallets, representing special hardware devices, are not vulnerable to fraudulent activity when they are offline.

Step 3. How to buy Bitcoin easily: choose a payment method you want

Open a trading account in less than 3 min Create account

Bitcoin exchanges accept different payment options. Today you can use traditional payment methods, such as a bank transfer, credit and debit card transactions or even Apple Pay to fund your account and buy Bitcoins.

You simply click the 'Buy' or 'Sell' button on the exchange and select the payment method you want.

Credit and debit card payments are considered the most popular and user-friendly options, as they require less time. However, they may impose higher fees. Bank transfers, in turn, usually have lower fees, but they are more time-consuming.

Step 4. Buy Bitcoin now

Once you have set up your account on the crypto exchange, decided where to store your Bitcoins and what payment method to choose – you are ready to buy some Bitcoins or its fractions.

The crypto exchange will provide you with the real-time streaming Bitcoin price rate and show how much of a Bitcoin (or how many Bitcoins) you can buy for a particular sum of money.

Note that Bitcoin is used to skyrocketing and drastically sinking throughout its history. And even if you do not have enough funds to buy a Bitcoin, you can buy a fraction and trade it further to earn more.

To place a trade at Currency.com or another platform, you input the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy in the given field and click the ‘Buy’ button. This is a classic market buy order, which will purchase Bitcoin at the best market rate.

Once you have executed your purchase, your new Bitcoin assets will be stored in your Currency.com account. It is up to you to decide what to do with them next.

Step 5. Withdraw or hold your Bitcoins to sell them further.

Now when you have Bitcoins on your account, you start thinking what to do next. There are always several options.

Trade Bitcoin

If you have an account on a crypto trading platform you can not only buy Bitcoin at a competitive price, but also sell or exchange it. A wide choice of crypto-to-fiat currency pairs open enormous opportunities for traders to make money from price movements. You can sell Bitcoin the same way you buy it. Simply put a sell order, specifying the amount you want to sell, and the exchange will execute your order.

Hold Bitcoin

Having shown some positive price dynamics since the beginning of 2020, Bitcoin is considered a lucrative store of value. If you share the bullish forecasts for Bitcoin price, you may decide to hold your coins for a while and try to reap more profit.

Spend Bitcoin

It’s easy to forget that you can always use Bitcoin to buy goods and services. The list of vendors and retailers who accept Bitcoin payments, including Starbucks, Whole Foods and Nordstrom, is steadily growing.

According to SpendBitcoins.com, over 100,000 merchants are ready to provide almost anything you would like to buy with Bitcoin.

In the end

Bitcoin has proved to be a strong cryptocurrency which deserves investor attention. Today many traditional stock investors and traders choose Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies to diversify their investment portfolio. Although the crypto market and Bitcoin in particular is very volatile, it can bring you significant profit. Buy, sell and exchange your crypto holdings with a reliable crypto trading provider to make it work.

To make things easier, we’ve put together a comprehensive guide to bring you up to speed on the latest changes.



Crypto-assets have entered the mainstream in the past few years, attracting the attention of tax authorities in leading economies. Following a boom in trading and prices, the gains made from crypto-related deals and activities are starting to be counted toward taxable income. Especially in the developed countries, tax authorities have tools to track unreported income.



Cryptocurrency taxation accelerated after 2014, when Bitcoin and a handful of assets arrived on stage. With the arrival of significant gains in 2017, most tax authorities prepared to reinvent their rules and attempt stricter regulations on potentially hidden income.

Having a general idea of when taxable events occur make it possible for crypto investors to make informed decisions, and avoid working in breach of local laws.

Overall, the past 12 months saw shifts in regulations related to cryptocurrency. Tax regulators started not only passively reminding investors to pay any due taxes, but also issued specific guidelines and warnings on reporting income. It is possible that the IRS can also track transactions for some networks. The latest status of tax requirements and the level of interest that tax authorities pay to crypto assets varies by country and region, with the tax rates ranging from zero to as high as 55%. For now, the IRS 60X rule for futures and options trading refers only to forex options and futures, where 60% of gains or losses are accounted as long-term capital gain, and 40% are treated as short-term capital gains.

The Legal Status of Digital Currencies, Tokens, or Coins

The general consensus is that digital currencies of any form or based on any technology represent a type of ownership. The nature of the asset is relative as some types of tokens are considered securities.

Worldwide, regulations differ, but so far, no country has admitted any digital asset as “money”, “currency” or legal tender. Crypto assets are usually categorized as commodities, or a form of property.

So far, merely holding digital assets in a wallet is not a reportable event for most tax jurisdictions. But the most important concept is that of capital gains, or gains and losses realized upon the sale of a digital coin or token. Because cryptocurrency prices are extremely variable, it is highly possible that not all coins are sold for a gain.

Taxing and legalizing BTC and crypto trading is a complex issue, with each nation having its own set of rules. A handy list compiled by Reuters may be the starting point for exploring one’s specific tax situation and events that need to be reported.

Capital Gains from Crypto Sales

A capital gain is a rise in the value of any asset held, whether stocks, real estate, or in this case, ownership of digital assets. A capital gain is only realized when the asset is sold.

It’s important to differentiate between a short-term capital gain, where the asset is held for less than a year. Longer-term holding means the sale will be taxed at the usually more favorable rate for long-term capital gains.

Because of the turbulent nature of cryptocurrency trading, short-term capital gains reporting may be more involved, requiring a log of all trading activity, as well as gains or losses realized.

The rule of short-term, or long-term gains may be applied depending on jurisdiction, and some taxation forms do not allow for such a differentiation.

Taxable Events

The other important concept on trading crypto assets may be the actualization of a taxable event. For some jurisdictions, this may be as simple as selling the underlying asset.

But for US nationals, a taxable event may arise in other situations. Those may include:

Using cryptocurrency for buying and selling;

Exchanges between crypto assets;

Coins or tokens allocated in an airdrop;

Coins and tokens allocated after a hard fork;

Receiving a payment in the form of crypto assets.

US taxation rules are not entirely clear on taxing hard forks or tokens received for essentially zero-value. There is no consensus on what is the fair value of an airdrop, but it must be kept in mind it is possible some assets may be counted as a taxable event.

In the past few years, the growth of the sheer number of cryptocurrency assets, in the form of new coins and tokens, makes it impossible to track all assets received. However, some exchanges and other cryptocurrency-related operators may have the duty to report cryptocurrency sales and withdrawals.

Case: US-Based Forms

US-based exchanges have been asked to produce 1099-K form, which only counts the transaction coming out of the exchange. This means the trader may have sold at a loss, but the end withdrawal may be counted as a gain.

To avoid the confusion, US citizens may have to fill out form 8849, which allows for more detailed tracking of asset acquisition and disposal.

But this case reveals a more proactive approach, as the IRS started to send out letters reminding traders to pay taxes on their crypto gains. But after more detailed discussions, the IRS has allowed for detailed reporting to describe all exchanges and trades that are relevant to the tax base.

Cryptocurrency Ownership

At the moment, most blockchains, starting with Bitcoin, are pseudonymous. In theory, it is possible to track ownership, but only if there is voluntary reporting. For tax purposes, authorities count the receipt of assets as a confirmed transaction, and the moment the assets come under control.

In 2020, total surveillance of digital asset ownership is not feasible, and the IRS is still not tracking all potential owners. However, in the case of some tokens or specific blockchains, the ownership may be tied at least to a personalized account. In rare cases the issuers of tokens even perform KYC, tying ownership to a real-world identity.

But there is no proactive approach to track crypto ownership, and until the assets are sold through an exchange, or in another manner that is traceable, only voluntary reporting remains to inform the taxman.

And while the consensus sees crypto gains as taxable, at this point it is still possible for multiple transactions or trades to remain outside the scope of tax authorities. But those conditions may change in the future, exposing anyone that may have tried to disguise crypto ownership or gains.

Hard Forks and Capital Gains

The issue of hard forks has been highly contentious for cryptocurrency owners. Buying Bitcoin was simple enough. But in the past two years alone, Bitcoin forked into several assets, thus potentially giving all owners the claim to the same amount of coins on other networks.

Starting with Bitcoin Cash, there have been more than a dozen forks. And while some of those assets traded at very low prices, the IRS issued requirements in late 2019, which ambiguously claimed a taxable event upon the receipt of a hard fork.

But the IRS has not clarified what it means to receive coins in a hard fork. Taking control of those coins is not automatic, and requires a process known as “coin splitting.” Coin splitting requires that an exchange credits the user accounts with the forked coins. The other approach is to move coins to a new wallet, where the balance may be recovered from the new network. Not all owners of BTC choose to gain access and control to all forked coins.

This has led to a letter requiring the US IRS to specify what it means by receiving coins in a hard fork, and to avoid taxation that may lead to a high tax bill for a now-worthless asset.

Case: Bitcoin Gold

Bitcoin Gold was a hard fork from late 2017, which produced an asset initially trading above $500. If the initial IRS guidelines are to be counted, all BTC owners at the time of the hard fork, if they are US citizens, would owe tax on the new asset.

But the price basis for Bitcoin Gold is a price that has nothing to do with current market prices. The time of claiming the coins, if that is counted, may be very different from the price when Bitcoin Gold initially traded. BTG subsequently fell to a price as low as $5, and recovered to around $12 in early 2020.

Establishing the taxable event for this relatively small fork, as well as other similar attempts at re-creating Bitcoin, is still under discussion.

As of December 20, 2019, the IRS is still reviewing a letter from Congress, requiring a revision of the guidelines, and demanding that the latest tax rules are not treated as established law. Instead, the group of Congressmen takes into account the fact that cryptocurrencies are still a new technology, which cannot be captured in the rules of 1099 forms.

It is possible that reporting may vary in its detail and intentions, and the IRS cannot foresee and establish each taxable event arising from various digital coins or tokens. Hence, the best approach may be to look at trading history, but also to keep in mind the final gains, as well as funds that entered bank accounts or were received in another manner.

How the IRS Defines Crypto Value

The idea that cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets represent value, and are hence taxable, stems from the way the IRS codifies those assets as representing value in recognized national currencies, including the US dollar.

“Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as “convertible” virtual currency. Bitcoin, Ether, Roblox, and V-bucks are a few examples of a convertible virtual currency. Virtual currencies can be digitally traded between users and can be purchased for, or exchanged into, U.S. dollars, Euros, and other real or virtual currencies,” the IRS stipulates.

“The sale or other exchange of virtual currencies, or the use of virtual currencies to pay for goods or services, or holding virtual currencies as an investment, generally has tax consequences that could result in tax liability,” warns the IRS.

From those propositions stem most cases where each individual owner or trader may have to figure out the exact approach to report income, based on specific gains or losses.

The IRS has a set of guidelines, ranging from general to specific, and has asked for reporting since 2014. But the new tax season has more details on reporting, this time expanding the scope of taxable events. The rules of 2019 are what is considered the most recent and relevant basis for reporting for tax season 2020.

Letters of Warning

In 2019, the IRS signalled its strong stance on crypto trading by sending 10,000 letters of warning. The letters were of two types – a warning and educational letter, and a more serious one demanding a reply and actions to file the correct tax returns.

Letters 6174 and 6174-A require no action. But receiving letter 6173 requires an immediate response, and the failure to do so invites a tax audit.

The sending of 10,000 letters suggests IRS may be tracking accounts related to exchanges, most probably Coinbase. The accounts mentioned in the letter do not relate to wallets or other forms of ownership, such as having balances on the blockchain.

To file the correct tax return, if required, may be done through form 1040. The warnings and requirements affect persons that have shown activity related to cryptocurrency trading, while failing to mention their ownership and trading operations.

Sources of Balance Information

Building up the base to calculate taxes may be complicated. Information on balances may be acquired from exchange logs.

For now, the IRS has not issued specific requirements for futures or derivatives trading. Futures trading and margin cryptocurrency 100X leverage are also not unusual, and may generate specific income streams. In 2020, there are no specific guidelines on how to tax 200X leverage, or even higher margin calls. But it is possible to claim a loss on trades.

Reporting on Bitcoin transactions may also happen using various techniques, including FIFO and LIFO. But in the case of Bitcoin, any specific time of purchase may arrive with different price ranges. This means that a detailed list of transactions may specify exactly which coin was sold, and what is the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.

For instance, selling a coin acquired at $8,000 is not the same as one acquired when BTC was $1 or even $30. Hence, there is no requirement to sell earliest coins first, and reporting may focus on an asset purchased at a specific price.

This possibility means selling Bitcoin can form a base that can also lead to temporary capital loss, if the reporting person chooses to minimize taxes for a certain time period.

Transaction information from wallets is also not revealing all taxable events. Moving coins between owned wallets or addresses is not considered a taxable event. So far, the IRS has not issued guidelines on reporting transactions or revealing the intention behind transactions, or giving any other evidence of private key ownership.

Crypto-to-Crypto Exchanges and Stablecoins

Perhaps the most confusing moment of cryptocurrency trading is the need to report a switch between crypto assets, as well as any capital gains stemming from those operations.

The IRS has a concept of Like-Kind exchange, which does not generate a taxable event when moving between some types of assets. However, this does not apply to cryptocurrency exchanges, which are not registered for Like-Kind swaps. For US citizens, as of 2020, those types of exchanges are only limited to real estate.

This also means cryptocurrency exchanges in the US are not registered to support Like-Kind exchanges, and fulfill the requirements to file form 8824. This also means that switching between Bitcoin and altcoins is capable of generating a taxable event.

For instance, buying BTC at $6,000, and exchanging it for Ethereum when BTC has already climbed to $9,000 generates the same capital gain of $3,000.

However, this gain can be offset by a loss as well. In case the altcoin drops in value, the sale itself generates a loss that may offset the capital gains, in the end leading to a lower tax bill. However, both operations need to be accounted for, until the last liquidation into fiat.

Stablecoins and Taxes

In 2020, most cryptocurrency trades use one of several coins pegged to the value of the US dollar. Those assets have varied states of legal acceptance, but are widely used worldwide. The most common one, Tether, or USDT, is capable of storing the value of assets sold.

In the above example, BTC appreciated from $6,000 to $9,000. However, the asset was exchanged for USDT, meaning the funds are still not switched to fiat. Still, the capital gains may generate a taxable event, which means stablecoins are not suitable tools to disguise capital gains.

For US citizens, coins like Paxos, TUSD, or USDC also require complete screening with real-world identity evaluation. For now, exchanges do not report trades that transform gains into stablecoins. However, stablecoin issuers are a potential source of disclosure. Having a Coinbase account, as already discussed, means the IRS may be aware of cryptocurrency activity, while discounting the usage of stablecoins.

However, the best approach is to consult an expert on the issue of transactions between cryptocurrencies. The best approach is to have a complete log of activities, to achieve an easier calculation of the tax basis.

Crypto Taxation in Canada

The Canada Revenue Agency works with a set of guidelines from 2014, advising on the correct filing. Canada supported highly active cryptocurrency activity, and the tax authorities had the tools to track and require payments, similar to the US system.

Canada treats cryptocurrencies as commodities for the purposes of taxation. Depending on sources, income tax or capital gains tax is applicable. Canada differentiates between sporadic and regular income, and treats regular activities as sources of business income.

As for fair value, the requirement is to estimate and self-report based on general guidelines.

“To figure out the value of a cryptocurrency transaction where a direct value cannot be determined, you must use a reasonable method. Keep records to show how you figured out the value. Generally, the CRA’s position is that the fair market value is the highest price, expressed in dollars that a willing buyer and a willing seller who are both knowledgeable, informed and prudent, and who are acting independently of each other, would agree to in an open and unrestricted market,” the Canadian tax authority explained.

Crypto-to-crypto exchanges are also causing a taxable event in Canada, similar to the US-based system. Similarly, reporting for Canadian citizens or businesses requires the preservation of most records, including wallet entries, exchange withdrawals and any other relevant data on transfers and acquired coins and tokens.

Tax Situation in the EU

The European Union is one of the more relaxed regions for cryptocurrency trading. However, most countries are aware of the gains potentially made in cryptocurrency trading.

The tax rules within the EU are highly varied, as the overall rules allow trading, while leaving it to countries to figure out the tax accounts of citizens or corporations. For that reason, it is difficult to offer general guidelines on EU-based taxation. The exact rules vary based on local tax rates and types of taxes.

There is also a disparity in the way each country views digital coins and tokens. Germany, for instance, sees Bitcoin as money, however, not official money, but a form of “private money”. Switzerland, one of the most lax regulators, accounts for cryptocurrency in the way forex markets are codified when it comes to taxation.

For most EU countries, owning digital assets does not need to be declared. Switzerland is an exception, where the Swiss franc value of those assets must be declared in advance at the start of the tax year.

However, there is a big exception for speculative trading – not all operations need to be taxed as they happen. This is a big advantage and a relief to EU citizens, where only the initial and final value of assets may be reported.

Usually, traders will make a series of deals, and it is rare to see straightforward buying and selling of Bitcoin or other assets. The EU rules may be solved on a case-by-case basis. However, it must be noted EU bank accounts can be traced, and transfers above 5,000 EUR are often scrutinized.

EU-Based Exchanges and Brokerages

EU-based exchanges and brokerages are usually completely transparent. They are connected to the EU-wide banking system, and offer relatively high limits for trading and withdrawals.

However, EU-based exchanges are not obliged to report on taxes and tax events, especially given the decentralized nature of the union, with many different jurisdictions. Thus, all EU citizens must report their gains or losses as physical persons, to pay the taxes owed.

The EU taxation rules also apply to Malta, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and other territories that have harmonized their financial legislation. The potentially applicable taxes are, in most cases, physical person income tax; some forms of local taxes; wealth tax when it applies, and possibly corporate tax in case the cryptocurrency activity is related to a business entity.

EU and VAT on Crypto Deals

Cryptocurrency trading in the EU is treated in a way similar to forex trades. This means the trades do not incur VAT. Merchant usage of cryptocurrencies is also freely available, and for now may be a tool to circumvent VAT payments.

Taxing Miners in the EU

Cryptocurrency mining is differentiated from speculative activities. Namely, the gains from this activity can be counted as the results of business activity. Thus, the sale price of coins can be offset by business expenses, including the hardware and electricity costs incurred in the process. This approach may require the services of an accountant, which may end up in a lower tax bill.

The EU has not issued any specific requirements on income from hard forks or airdrops. For now, capital gains where they apply may be calculated for any coins received and possibly sold for fiat.

UK Crypto Taxation

The UK has had most of its financial rules harmonized with the EU. However, with Brexit looming as of January 31, 2020, and with a 10-month process of establishing a new relationship with the EU, the UK may have a different set of taxation rules before long.

The overall stance of the UK is that cryptocurrency is either an asset/property, or private money. Tax reporting also hinges on the principle of capital gains tax. Sales tax, a form of VAT, does not apply to cryptocurrency deals.

Case-By-Case Basis

Unlike the US, where the IRS has attempted to create a system of terms, the UK tax service HMRC has taken a case-by-case stance. This means that each transfer or sale may be regarded as a novel situation, looking into where the exchange of value really happened.

The HMRC has admitted that cryptocurrency is a new sector, and with the advent of tokens, it has created multiple tax situations that are too complex for a single framework.

UK Tax Terms

The tax authority has still established some general terms for digital assets. Usually, those

Assets utilize a Distributed Ledger, although a distributed ledger does not necessarily use a token or coin. Those assets can be stored, transferred, or exchanged.

The HMRC recognizes three types of assets: exchange tokens, utility tokens, and security tokens. Bitcoin, for instance, is considered an exchange token.

Taxation happens based on the de facto events regarding value transfers and capital gains, and not on the definition of the token. Thus, selling Bitcoin or a security token incurs the same capital gains tax.

The general stance of UK tax authorities is that in the majority of cases, individuals hold onto the tokens as a form of alternative personal investment.

“In the vast majority of cases, individuals hold cryptoassets as a personal investment, usually for capital appreciation in its value or to make particular purchases. They will be liable to pay Capital Gains Tax when they dispose of their cryptoassets,” the tax guidelines state.

But because the tax authority looks at different cases, using cryptocurrency as an alternative form of payments may incur not only capital gains tax, but also personal income tax and insurance.

UK Definition of Crypto Trader

UK tax authorities also differentiate between sporadic cryptocurrency deals, and what may be considered “trading” activity. High frequency and volume of activity may constitute financial trading activity, and incur a different type of taxation; once again income tax instead of capital gains tax.

“As with any activity, the question whether cryptoasset activities amount to trading depends on a number of factors and the individual circumstances. Whether an individual is engaged in a financial trade through the activity of buying and selling cryptoassets will ultimately be a question of fact. It’s often the case that individuals and companies entering into transactions consisting of buying and selling cryptoassets will describe them as ‘trades’. However, the use of the term ‘trade’ in this context is not sufficient to be regarded as a financial trade for tax purposes,” the tax authority explains.

Thus, in the UK, it is important to differentiate between sporadic activity, and what may be considered business-like activity or regular trading.

In the case of highly active and regular cryptocurrency-related activities, business income reporting may be necessary, falling under a different set of rules.

Airdrops Not Considered Until Liquidation

The term disposal means the final act of liquidating digital assets. Like all crypto cases, the UK authorities look at the specifics and whether the airdrops have the nature of assets with potential returns. Generic, goodwill airdrops not related to any purchase or investment, incur capital gains only upon their sale.

More specific airdrops which may present dividends or other types of returns present specific challenges, depending on whether the assets were liquidated or if their value presented potential capital gains.

Airdrops were a fad in 2017 and 2018, when projects would award tokens for free, as a tool to expand their communities. Those types of generic airdrops can usually be accounted as a capital loss.

Token Pooling

UK tax reporting has specific rules when accounting for multiple token sales with gains or losses. There is a 30-day waiting rule when acquiring new assets, before they can be pooled when accounting for capital gains or losses. Newly acquired assets that are traded within 30 days of acquisition must be counted separately.

Older assets may be used to calculate the cost of sale and the tax basis.

For instance, if Alice bought 10 BTC for $1,000, and then bought 10 BTC for $1000,000, she would have a total allowable pooled cost of $101,000. Selling 5 BTC for $40,000 could be discounted with the cost of 5 BTC from the pooled cost, or $25,250. Alice’s total tax gain would be $14,750, on which tax would be due.

However, if Alice bought one BTC at $7,000 and sold it days later at $8,000, it would be accounted separately and not pooled with previous purchases for a cost basis.

This rule makes the timing of purchases and a detailed log extremely important. Claiming a different cost basis may make a big difference in counting gains or losses. With turbulent crypto prices, this may also make the final tax bill look different. In any case, just like US-based traders or owners, UK tax reporting requires keeping score of all transactions, and being ready to make the case for one’s specific intentions and levels of cryptocurrency activity.

Pooling and Hard Forks

The HMRC will consider hard forks on a case-by-case basis. This means that if a Bitcoin owner did not decide to split coins, or receive coins from an exchange, tax authorities may be understanding and not require reporting.

For instance, a snapshot of the Bitcoin blockchain, which reportedly allowed access to HEX tokens, need not be reported if a user does not intend to take the HEX tokens, or trade them.

But if a fork-based asset is acquired, its fair value and cost are not pooled with other tokens, and a sale can be calculated just for that asset.



Rekt: Reporting Asset Prices Going to Zero

UK-based traders may claim they “disposed” of an asset, where the value has gone to zero. Even without a sale, following general capital gains rules, an asset can be pronounced to have “negligible value”. The zero-based value can then be used in conjunction with the cost basis of pooled assets, to claim capital losses.

This rule is especially valuable to altcoins, where indeed losses and crashes to zero have been possible, despite previous spikes to extraordinary valuations.

Lost Private Keys

Based on the above rule, loss of private keys may be used on a case-by-case basis to avoid paying capital gains. In case of a loss, the user claims negligible value minus the re-acquisition value of the assets, to crystallize a loss. However, the loss must be accepted by the HMRC, to avoid fraudulent claims. The tax authorities do not track blockchains, and claiming to have owned and lost private keys must be supported by evidence.

However, the HMRC does not have provisions for theft or loss of digital assets, except for the potential to claim negligible value.

As seen above, the UK guidelines are extremely detailed and also flexible, to reflect the shifting nature of the cryptocurrency space. The above cases may be made for other jurisdictions, and reveal examples in which tax authorities do not have a proactive outreach, but may be amenable to reporting or negotiations.

The latest UK regulation on cryptocurrency dates back from 2018, and there may be changes once Brexit becomes a reality.

Southeast Asia, Japan and China: Specifics in Crypto Taxation

Southeast Asia is one of the hottest regions for cryptocurrency activity. For that reason, in the past few years, tax authorities have also reawakened to the reality of relatively high potential gains from trading.

Japan considers Bitcoin as a legal method of payments. Its approach is to levy capital gains tax on sales made for profit or loss. Cryptocurrency payment is highly developed in Japan, but payments are exempt from consumption tax.

Japanese taxation is relatively high, ranging between 15 and 55%, with mandatory reporting required on gains made based on crypto assets. The taxation depends on tax brackets, and is higher in comparison to gains from international stocks. Japan has allowed exchanges to link directly to banks, and trading is not anonymous, hence traceable by the National Tax Authority.

China, for now, is still the Wild East when it comes to crypto. All coins and tokens are considered a “virtual commodity”. Ownership, trading, and disposal of cryptocurrencies are still a legal gray area.

As of 2020, China has still not levied tax on digital asset gains, despite the highly active trading activities. Exchanges may report in the form of corporate taxes, but for individuals, there is no tracking or compulsory reporting.

The reason for this may be the fact that China tried hard to separate the world of banking and fiat from trading cryptocurrencies. Back in 2017, most exchanges stopped offering pairs with the Chinese yuan, and switched to trading between coins only, with the aid of stablecoins. Legal observations have not noted any specific rules regarding cryptocurrency reporting, except for monitoring and auditing general wealth.

Since the fall of 2017, it has been near-impossible to trade in fiat. Hence, Chinese traders moved their activity entirely on the blockchain, and into USDT tokens. China is thus unable to track bank accounts, or link exchange accounts to real persons. Its aim to deprive the crypto sector of a fiat gateway is also hampering the potential to collect taxes.

The chief reason for China’s stance is to impress its rules on capital controls. However, the potential to move cryptocurrency internationally has somewhat managed to circumvent those controls, at least partially.

Crypto regulations constantly fluctuate in Southeast Asian countries. It is possible some countries levy taxes where there were none before.

Currently, Singapore levies no tax on crypto transactions. However, the country is very strict about money laundering, and has capital controls to avoid funds flowing out of the country. Selling cryptocurrency in Singapore may in the end require foreign citizens to report the sale to their respective countries’ tax authorities, or face a penalty and even imprisonment.

Thailand’s model is relatively simple, levying a 15% capital gains tax, while allowing a waiver of the 7% VAT in the country.

Hong Kong is also offering tax-free Bitcoin sales, and does not require specific reporting on trades. However, income in cryptocurrency for merchants may have to be reported in Hong Kong dollar value.

Foreign nationals, however, are mostly blocked by significant difficulties in liquidating assets in those regions. Attempting to avoid taxes may be a complex affair for foreign nationals, and lead to potential penalties.

Cryptocurrency laws in Asia are also constantly reinvented, mostly focusing on fraud, consumer finance risks, as well as money laundering. For now, the regions have more lenient policies on taxation.

Russia: Still Struggling to Tax Crypto Assets

Russia is yet another region where cryptocurrency activity is extremely high. Yet the country is still not ready with regulations, and trading is a big gray area. For now, cryptocurrency activity flies under the radar of tax authorities.

But the Russian Duma may be working on new legislation, potentially tracking cryptocurrency activity and finally taxing individuals. For now, Russia still allows low-verification trading on some exchanges, which remain high-risk. Banks have offered to track transactions coming from cryptocurrency sales, but for now, Russian traders and sellers may fly under the tax radar.

So, Can Crypto Avoid Some Taxes?

In 2020, it looks like most of the Western countries and some markets in Asia are on track with taxing cryptocurrency gains. The IRS has taken the most proactive approach by linking identities to Coinbase accounts. But there are still offshore regions where cryptocurrency sales may be tax-exempt.

There is a caveat though- for most jurisdictions, the location of assets is considered the country of citizenship. This means even if a token is held on an offshore exchange, its location can still be considered the UK or the US for tax purposes.

Still, there are regions where a tax-free sale could be achieved, alongside other techniques for offshore businesses.

Slovenia, part of the EU, has all the benefits of a fully legalized market, plus zero capital gains tax on cryptocurrency sales. However, income in cryptocurrency is taxed with personal income tax. But overall, speculative trading may be possible for local residents without capital gains tax.

Belarus, while not in the EU, is one of the regions where crypto taxation is a gray area. The country, despite political risks, is still a haven of crypto activity, for those willing to get exposure to its regime and economy.

Offshore zones already mentioned include Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as possibly China’s Hainan special economic zone. But similar possibilities exist for Barbados, Malaysia, and Mauritius. Other offshore zones with special cryptocurrency rules include Puerto Rico, the hurricane-stricken country which attracted Bitcoiners.

But perhaps the biggest advantage is that cryptocurrency trades are VAT-exempt, limiting the liability when switching to fiat.

Tools to Calculate Crypto Taxes

The tax base could be calculated using logs from wallets or exchanges. But there are tools that make the tracking of transactions easier, as well as the balances required to calculate the tax base.

Tools like Koinly consolidate exchange information, wallet transactions, and include the potential for professional advice to achieve the minimal potential tax payment. Koinly works with multiple major tax authorities, for detailed reports with complete compliance.

The eToro brokerage and trading platform also includes tax calculation for UK citizens. It is also possible to use generic free tools for easier calculation. Crypto tax calculators usually support information directly from exchanges to complete the reports.

Taxing Mining Income

Mining income is, in most cases, treated as regular business income, with rules applying to the specific jurisdiction. The biggest advantage of miners is they may claim the expenses of hardware and electricity to decrease the tax basis. In the past, mining has been an amateur activity. But since 2016, cryptocurrency mining 50x increases in activity were not unusual, for Bitcoin and other assets.

Depending on the coin mined, the value of this activity may be extremely low, as in the case of amateur mining. But Bitcoin mining may be used as a tool to decrease the tax basis for most miners. With multiple operations situated in China, it is possible some miners fly under the radar.

Best Approach to Crypto Taxation

The best approach to cryptocurrency taxation is to err on the side of reporting. Regulations shift all the time, and depending on the potential for surveillance on bank accounts, tax authorities may be more aggressive in seeking out earnings originating from cryptocurrency exchanges. Simply having a big unexplained balance may alert tax authorities.

The rules of residence may vary, as some regions may have more lenient taxation.

The other requirement is to keep detailed records of all activities, either using specialized tools or tracking and copying each transaction or operation to calculate the most favorable tax base based on regional rules.

For now, there is no need to report or reveal addresses or wallets, or declare a connection between a name and an address. But in the future, blockchain tracking may become a big part of taxation rules. Currently, only a few startups are working on tracking the blockchain, identifying “whales” and significant moves. But in the future, assets themselves may not be fungible and anonymous, leading to a stricter potential for taxation.

With season 2020 in full swing for reporting, the world of cryptocurrency also faced stricter regulations in the EU, as well as the USA, coming into force in the new year. Increased surveillance also looks like a positive fact, in that cryptocurrency has been accepted among investment methods, and taxing is a way to legitimize that activity.

The cover protects Bittrex against theft or collusion of its cold storage assets, and was arranged through Lloyds of London with support from broker Marsh.

Sarah Downey, co-leader of digital asset risk transfer at Marsh, said the policy had been developed by working closely with Bittrex to meet the unique challenges of their requirements: “We worked closely with Bittrex to create a tailored insurance solution to fit their specific cryptocurrency needs.”

The deal is one of the largest agreed to date, but is not the first time Lloyds have been involved in insuring crypto companies. In 2018, Lloyds arranged cover for Kingdom Trust, a crypto custodian, as well as writing a policy for Coinbase hot wallets in 2019.

According to Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara, the insurance comes on top of a number of layers of existing security built in to the exchange platform, and provides an enhanced degree of comfort for users of its platform.

The contract was reportedly agreed after Bittrex demonstrated its compliance and internal security procedures to the satisfaction of the insurers, offering further reassurance to those holding deposits at the exchange.

Crypto insurance is difficult to arrange and difficult for insurers to price, due to the notoriously high risks involved in managing and securely storing crypto assets.

Earlier in January, executives from Gemini exchange said they chose to set up their own insurance company to provide up to $200 million in coverage for their assets held in custody, after difficulties securing cover from external providers.

Despite the challenges, insurance is seen as an essential stepping stone to more institutional involvement in cryptocurrency.

According to industry research, a number of institutional investors who would get involved with cryptocurrency currently cannot due to a lack of adequate insurance coverage across the sector.

The Bittrex contract is the latest sign that insurers may be getting to grips with covering the risks associated with storing and managing digital assets.

A closely watched veteran trader who became legendary in crypto circles for calling Bitcoin’s big collapse in January of 2018 is revealing his latest thoughts on BTC, XRP and Litecoin, the world’s first, third and seventh-largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.

Peter Brandt, who has previously said Bitcoin could rise to $100,000 in its current long-term cycle, says the king coin remains in an historic bull trend. In his latest weekly crypto outlook, Brandt says the leading cryptocurrency is now showing early signs that it could climb “a lot higher” than $100k.

“We can use this recent low that we’ve seen back in December that connects back to December 2018 as kind of now redefining the parabolic advance that could be in the process of developing now. And that has implications.

I don’t want to get too far ahead of myself because I can make an argument here that I’m not sure really can be made yet – that we’re going a lot higher than $100,000, and it won’t be until 2021.”

Brandt says BTC may be coiling in a bullish symmetrical triangle that dates back to late 2017.

“A continuation symmetrical triangle is a coil that contains four major contact points. If we fail at this upper line and turn down, then it could be a symmetrical triangle top.

But for now, I’m going to look at it as a symmetrical triangle continuation, and as time goes on and we start to challenge this upper line, especially if we take out the highs that we made back here in June, then we’ve completed this symmetrical triangle, and we can really start accelerating the bull trend in Bitcoin.”

As for the altcoin market, Brandt says Litecoin is also showing signs of a potential bullish triangle similar to that of Bitcoin.

“Symmetrical triangles or triangulations tend to be a magic pattern with Litecoin, and you can see it a couple of places here – the big ascending triangle that blew off in 2017 and you had another triangulation [in 2018]. You’ve had different triangulations taking place, especially symmetrical triangles in Litecoin.”

As for XRP, Brandt says he often hears from investors who closely follow the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Although Brandt says XRP may prove to be a “boomer” and rise exponentially in value, he stresses his belief that Bitcoin is the real crypto asset to watch

“I know many of you are Ripple fans, XRP fans. I’m sorry, I just can’t get all excited about that. I’ve talked about that in the past with you many times. For me, this is a Bitcoin story. Bitcoin is the legacy coin. I don’t want to be sidetracked because I think the granddaddy of them all is going to continue to be Bitcoin.

… XRP may very well be a boomer, but it’s also going to be a buster. So my focus will continue to be on Bitcoin and I’ll look at Bitcoin as the litmus test of everything else.”

November 2012 was 4 years before the first Bitcoin halving event. At the time, Bitcoin was worth just around $12. During this time, the miner’s reward within the BTC network was a cool 25 BTC per problem solved.

The first halving event happened 4 years later in 2016, and the reward was slashed down to the current 12.5 BTC. However, it’s not the decrease of the reward that made history, but rather the event’s significance in catalyzing the price dynamics that followed the halving. By December 2017, Bitcoin was cruising price-wise to a tune of $20,000.

Basically, it’s already established that Bitcoin halving really affects the crypto’s price movements and this projection has had many people making variant opinions about the oncoming Bitcoin reward halving expected in May 2020. A great majority of these opinions have been on the bullish side of things. A recent tweet by Weiss Crypto Ratings explicates this.

Here’s how #Bitcoin halvings have impacted the market. So, does the Bitcoin halving help drive prices higher? Absolutely. The only question now is how high will #BTC go this time around? pic.twitter.com/YnSp4Y8igO — Weiss Crypto Ratings (@WeissCrypto) February 1, 2020

Latency Period

However, as much as the BTC halving event may be hyped to mean almost immediate price movement in 2020, it hasn’t always been like that with the previous halving. The halving of 2016 didn’t see much price movement until 2017. It’s already a known fact that the price increase of 2017 was the greatest crypto bull run yet.

That said, some crypto analysts are of the opinion that BTC might experience a latency period after the halving of May 2020, meaning that the price may not shoot up immediately after the event.

Going by the 2016 dynamics, the latency period could last almost a year. To some, 2021 may be the year when a sure Bitcoin bull run happens. In fact, some analysts expect BTC to hit the highs of $100k in 2021.

BTC Vs Inflation

For some time, Bitcoin has been touted as the ultimate long term favorite as a store of value, something that makes it attractive to investors seeking a more secure means of solving issues of inflation.

In fact, current projections show that Bitcoin is indeed a better cushion against inflation than the likes of Gold and the dollar (Going by the estimates of the Federal Reserve with respect to the US economy).","US Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang Says Regulations Cannot Impede Crypto

Andrew Yang, who is running for U.S. president in the 2020 election, has explained what his priorities will be regarding cryptocurrency under his administration. He said that crypto investors are finding a way to make use of their investments and regulations cannot impede it. Yang advocates for a uniform, nationwide set of crypto regulations so the U.S. is not stuck with state-by-state policies.

Yang’s Crypto Priorities

Andrew Yang is an entrepreneur who is running for U.S. president as a Democrat in 2020. In an interview with Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal in Iowa on Wednesday, Yang was asked about his policies in a number of areas, including cryptocurrency, universal basic income (UBI), and the coronavirus.

“There is a lot of people who are like really big cryptocurrency fans … they love Andrew Yang,” Weisenthal began. He asked the presidential candidate what he would do under his administration with regard to regulations of the crypto industry, such as bitcoin exchanges. “Do you support the right of people to use their bank accounts, credit cards, etc., to move into cryptocurrencies and other forms of money that aren’t as easily tracked by centralized authorities?” Yang replied:

What I would say is that we need to have a uniform set of rules and regulations around cryptocurrency use nationwide because right now we’re stuck with this hodgepodge of state-by-state treatments.

Emphasizing that the current way is “bad for everybody,” including innovators who want to invest in the crypto space, Yang declared: “So, that would be my priority … just clear and transparent rules so that everyone knows where they can head in the future and that we can maintain competitiveness.” He believes that the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies has “very, very high potential and we should be investing in it.”

An ABC News national poll from Jan. 26 shows Yang in fifth place, with 7% support. He was slightly behind Michael Bloomberg, but well behind Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. However, he was ahead of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.

Regulations Cannot Stop Crypto

Weisenthal asked Yang during the interview: “Would you support sort of monetary freedom for people that want to move their money away from fiat currencies, get their money out of the banking system into cryptocurrencies?” He elaborated: “Right now, you have banks restricting payments to these platforms and so forth. And people feel like government regulations are essentially impeding in their desire to do that.” Yang responded:

Right now people who are investing in these currencies are finding a way to, you know, do so and make use of their investments. No, I don’t think that you could impede it with regulations if you tried.

Yang’s Crypto Campaign

Yang has been outspoken about his crypto policies for quite some time. On his campaign website, he noted the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies. However, he explained: “A national framework for regulating these assets has failed to emerge, with several federal agencies claiming conflicting jurisdictions. At the same time, states have come up with a patchwork of varying regulations that make it difficult for the U.S. cryptocurrency markets to compete with those in other jurisdictions, especially China and Europe.”

He pointed out that different government departments treat cryptocurrency differently, such as property, commodities, or securities. He believes that it is time for the federal government to create clear crypto guidelines, asserting:

Cryptocurrency and digital asset markets have developed faster than regulations can keep up. Several states have conflicting and varying regulations on digital asset markets. Uncertainty in what regulatory framework will develop is causing U.S. investment in the area to lag behind the investment of other countries.

With clear guidelines, “businesses and individuals can invest and innovate in the area without fear of a regulatory shift,” Yang wrote, reiterating that “Investment in cryptocurrencies and digital assets has far outpaced our regulatory frameworks in the U.S.”

Autophagy, literally self-eating, is the latest dietary trend in the crypto community. More commonly known as fasting, the idea is to abstain from ingesting food for a set amount of time, ranging anywhere from 24 hours to an entire month or beyond. In doing so, proponents hope to improve their bodily health and mental acuity.

With nine hours left to my own exercise in self-starvation, I feel neither healthy nor sharp. In fact, I’m pretty sure I’m hallucinating. I’m imagining the taste of last night’s dinner. Fatty salmon. The salt on my tongue. A bed made of arugula. Alas, just cotton sheets and pillow to chew on. My only consolation? I’m not alone.

I’m skipping meals alongside the Bitcoin Fasting Group, a Telegram channel for crypto-minded people to discuss nutrition, organize fasts and encourage one another through their hunger. Using the predictable pattern of the bitcoin blockchain, which hashes a new set of transactions every 10 minutes, the group schedules 36- to 72-hour communal fasts once in a 2,000-block cycle, or about every two weeks if using a calendar.

I joined the channel in the middle of January after seeing a tweet promoting a fast. Beginning at block-height 614,000, a bunch of us (it’s impossible to say how many of the 242 members voluntarily participated) planned to forgo breakfast, lunch and dinner for the sport of it. The fast would start in the middle of the week, and I wanted to test the claims it would improve my productivity.

Katie Ananina, the channel’s founder, citizen journalist, and crypto bohemian from Siberia, gave me some pointers before embarking on this extreme – though relatively short – diet. First, don’t expect much; second, like a good Austrian economist, “try to keep a low time preference” (meaning I should value long term gain over short term discomfort).

She now sees the fasting group as a parallel conduit to 'hyperbitcoinization'

Ananina started fasting after going down the bitcoin rabbit hole in 2017. Once she began questioning the basic tenets of economics (which she studied at St. Petersburg University, before dropping out) her skepticism spread to other areas of her life. She now sees the fasting group as a parallel conduit to “hyperbitcoinization,” as both bitcoin and fasting encourage people to “exercise free will and self-discovery.”

“For a subset of the cryptocurrency community, getting interested and invested in this technology meant throwing out orthodoxy about the nature of money and other parts of society,” Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center’s director of communications, said over email. “Including nutrition.”

Building blocks

Though the process isn’t fully understood, fasting kick-starts a metabolic state called ketosis, where the body burns fat instead of carbohydrates, which has been linked to improved feelings of well-being, increased longevity and something called the best-known nerve growth factor.

“There’s a mountain of evidence that has caught on with the trend,” said Dr. Monique Tello, an internist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Tello has become a fasting evangelist after picking up the habit in medical school. She added that the best example may be how the practice has spread organically by word of mouth and on social media. (It’s how I heard of it!)

""Still Life with Peaches and Grapes"" by Auguste Renoir

“The internet has allowed alternative theories of nutrition to circulate, with communities forming around them,” Agrawal said. “The more people try it, the more data there will be. If that data looks promising to someone they may try it, too.”

Successful accounts of fasts in the crypto community aren’t hard for Tello to imagine. “Our bodies are very well adapted to deal with long periods of less food or no food,” she said. The story goes something like this:

Imagine our cave-dwelling ancestors, who hunted and gathered every meal: Their very existence was tied to the precarities of nature. Millennia of living through cycles of bounty and dearth are proof, for some, why human beings are not meant to be in a constant state of digestion.

Cave coiners

It’s this evolutionary perspective that may explain coiners’ experiments with heterodox diets. “The diet our culture has slipped into, high in added sugars and refined grains, is not good for clear thinking at all,” Tello said.

Just as bitcoin seeks a return to a sustainable economic system that challenges modern monetary policy, fasting subverts the received wisdom around “healthy diets” and modern supply chains, which produce foodstuff in total excess. “Beef is to food as bitcoin is to money,” said a member of the bitcoin fasting group, arguing for a ketogenic lifestyle.

Ananina encourages members to be self-sovereign and do their own research.

The essential nature of a bitcoiner is “someone who can search out valuable information, think critically, and is capable of taking responsibility for their own life, health, and finances,” said Hodlonaut, the astronautical feline Twitter personality and early member of the Bitcoin Fasting Group, in a private message.

Hodlonaut was an early member of the channel, and has been experimenting with fasting since 2017, about two years after he discovered bitcoin.

The ever-quotable Nic Carter, venture capitalist with Castle Island Ventures, called this phenomenon “epiphany-induced general skepticism.”

Stacking fasts

That this enlightenment to modernity’s shortcomings has resulted in as deep a skepticism of carbohydrates as central banking has taken the coin community pretty far out.

In 2017, it was reported bitcoiners were switching to all-meat diets. The trend led at least one person to eat nothing but meat for two weeks. (For what it’s worth, Teller said carnivorous diets are “hardly sustainable” and “have been associated with high levels of bad cholesterol in the bloodstream,” though could lead to “short-term weight loss.”)

A similar spurt of interest has been directed towards fasting. Since October, the Bitcoin Fasting Group has ballooned to more than 250 members, with more joining every day.

No matter how someone comes to bitcoin or heterodox diets, proponents of both will likely offer their support. However, this assistance is conditioned on whether the person is able to make their own informed decisions.

“Eating a low carbohydrate diet is a good way to prepare for fasting,” said Dr. Jason Fung, author of “The Complete Guide to Fasting,” and frequently cited source in the Telegram channel. “The average weight loss during fasting is 1/2 pound of body fat per day. Total weight loss is often more than this because of water loss.”

Ananina encourages members to be self-sovereign and do their own research. “Obviously, feel free to share your experience and ask questions, but the decision is always on you,” she said. Her philosophy is interwoven with the culture of the chat. With every documentary that’s recommended or research report posted, is a comment reminding others to draw their conclusions.

Kiernan Wright, former CEO of the Canadian mining company Honey Badger, is also new to the fasting group. I asked him if it seemed cultish to schedule fasts around the bitcoin block schedule. “This is more like a club than a religion, anyone can leave or join at will,” he said. “Bitcoin is a wonderful tool for organizing things, to push the boundaries of what is possible and to do it in a non-violent, non-coercive way, which is crucial to our survival.”","European authorities have arrested 10 suspects accused of defrauding over $6 million from tens of investors. The suspects conducted a crypto pyramid scheme targeting investors in several European countries, including France, Belgium and the U.K. The arrests are the culmination of an extensive investigation that began in 2018.

The investigation was led by Europol and Eurojust, EU agencies that focus on law enforcement and criminal justice cooperation respectively. In a press release, Eurojust indicated that the scheme had defrauded 85 investors, mainly from France and Belgium, although it was based in Israel.

The scheme targeted its victims by phone, promising them incredible returns of up to 35% for a small investment. In a classic pyramid scheme technique, the fraudsters paid off the initial investors using money raised from late-stage investors. The initial payments led many of the investors to stake more money and recommend the scheme to others.

However, after some time, the payments stopped, as they always do. The criminals began to channel all payments into bank accounts belonging to several fake companies in Asian countries and Turkey.

Investigations into the crime ring started in 2018, with Eurojust issuing investigation orders to authorities in the U.K., Bulgaria, Spain, Hungary, Portugal and the Czech Republic to assist with the investigations. In January last year, the authorities made the first arrests, bringing in four suspects arrested in France. Europol also partnered with authorities in Luxembourg to seize $1.1 million.

This is the latest case of crypto fraudsters being brought to book. In January alone, tens of crypto fraudsters have faced the law in connection to millions of dollars lost through crypto scams. The DoJ, for instance, recently charged two alleged fraudsters for using fake identities to raise over $30 million in an ICO. The two were behind CG Blockchain, a company that claimed to develop blockchain auditing tools.

The SEC, on the other hand, charged ICOBox with the issuing of an unregistered ICO in which it raised $14 million. Just days prior, it had charged a San Diego, California man for defrauding $3.5 million from investors in a cloud mining scam.

The law enforcement actions are a positive sign for the crypto industry as it indicates the authorities are cracking down on the rampant crypto scams. Once the industry sheds the scammers, it will appeal to more people and likely attract government support.

Bitcoin is sitting at a make-or-break point. This coming week BTC will decide whether to continue its bullish trend or pullback.

A Pivotal Point on Bitcoin’s Trend

Bitcoin entered a bull rally on Jan. 3 that has seen its price rise by nearly 40%. The flagship cryptocurrency went from trading at a low $6,900 to a high of $9,550 on Jan. 30. Since the peak, BTC began a consolidation phase without a clear sign of where it is heading next.

According to Josh Rager, a cryptocurrency trader and the co-founder of Blockroots, the recent price rejection off of the $9,500 resistance level could trigger a steep correction. A spike in the selling pressure behind BTC could push its price down to $8,800 or $8,700 before the bullish trend continues.

Rager believes that a break below this support level could cause panic among investors, sending Bitcoin down to $8,000 or $7,900.

Despite Rager’s assessment of a retracement, Big Chonis, a stock and cryptocurrency trader with over 10 years of experience, argues that “the weekly chart paints a different picture.” Chonis maintains that a weekly close above the $9,500 resistance level would be “very bullish” for Bitcoin.

Breaking this significant price barrier could send investors into a stage of FOMO (fear-of-missing-out). The pioneer cryptocurrency could surge quickly to the next level of resistance given by the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level, according to Chonis. This resistance level sits at $11,520.

The ambiguity about the fate of Bitcoin can be seen throughout the entire crypto market. As a result, the trading range between $9,260 and $9,500 is a reasonable no-trade zone. Moving below support would likely take BTC to the 78.6% or 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Conversely, closing above resistance could allow this crypto to test the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $10,400.

Overall Market Sentiment

Based on the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, investors appear to be overwhelmingly bullish about Bitcoin. In fact, this technical index is sensing high levels of greed among market participants over the past few days. Greed is usually perceived as a negative sign, which indicates that a selling opportunity could present itself soon. As Warren Buffett once said, “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”","Bitcoin emoji is now on Twitter. This is the first time that any platform has approved this symbol as an emoji. However, the BTC sign was approved as a Unicode symbol in 2017.

Twitter’s Bitcoin emoji has been introduced. This has generated lots of excitement within the crypto space. Twitter’s cryptocurrency community has been on fire as the Bitcoin symbol has been trending. However, it could have been rather expectable. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has been known to be a Bitcoin fan for many years now. His recent tweet has got a lot of positive feedbacks.

The Bitcoin symbol was approved as a Unicode symbol in 2017. This is the first time that any platform is approving the symbol as an emoji. It also indicates that Bitcoin is becoming part of popular culture. The Bitcoin emoji appears when the bitcoin hashtag is used. This has been hailed by many in the crypto space as a welcome development. Many fear that the crypto space is still young. This, of course, has led to concerns regarding market manipulation. Others have pointed to Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto space. This has set such people on the edge. They are concerned about the general acceptance of altcoins.

Many notable cryptocurrency experts have decided to keep the fire burning. Changpeng Zhao of Binance indicated this in a recent tweet.

It is uncertain who encouraged the addition of Bitcoin to Twitter’s emoji list. This hasn’t dampened the enthusiasm. Being a first, many have remained speculative as to its effect on Bitcoin prices. Some are still concerned about the sideways trend that Bitcoin is going through currently. Others want this move to drive Bitcoin prices up. Hodlers generally are in favor of the latter. There is a higher possibility of rising Bitcoin prices. The Bitcoin halving event is coming in a few months. Moves like this are slated to push prices higher than normal.

Bitcoin Emoji Will Improve Adoption Chances

Added to rising demand, this will be a win for the crypto space. It also improves the chances of adoption by newbies to the community. Hashtagging could be a powerful tool in doing this. Twitter adding Bitcoin to its emoji list may not go down well with regulators. This is a grey area for many. The U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has specifically classified Bitcoin as a commodity. One thing is certain: Bitcoin is gaining ground.

This is a public relations victory for the crypto space. Twitter is known to charge up to $1 million for the creation of emojis on its platform. Jack Dorsey’s announcement has created a new paradigm for the cryptocurrency. It places Bitcoin among one of the world’s top brands. Over 35,000 tweets have placed the hashtag in top twitter trends globally. This will change the way many view Bitcoin.

At the time of filing, this report Bitcoin (BTC) prices stood at $9,389.23. This is a 0.12% increase in the last 24 hours.","Become an FT subscriber to read:

Portfolio manager and crypto analyst Mati Greenspan says billions of dollars are essentially sitting on the sidelines, ready to move into Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and the altcoin market at large.

Greenspan is using data from the crypto research firm Messari, which shows that the total value of all stablecoins is just shy of $6 billion. Stablecoins are digital currencies that are pegged to traditional assets like fiat. They’re designed to maintain a steady value and offer crypto traders an easy way to sidestep the extreme volatility of the crypto markets.

Greenspan’s theory implies that the billions of dollars in the stablecoin market represent traders who have decided to exit their positions in BTC, ETH, XRP and other crypto assets and are waiting for the optimal time to re-enter the market.

Binance Research released a report in November on the habits of 69 clients with crypto allocations ranging from $100,000 to $25 million.

The report found that 96% of those investors are using the stablecoin market, with Tether (USDT) ranking as the favorite.

“USDT is the dominant stablecoin with 40.25% usage, holding the top ranking for both Chinese and English survey respondents. USDC, TUSD, PAX are following close behind USDT, and several English survey respondents wrote in BUSD under ‘Others’, reflecting an initial interest by our institutional & VIP clients…

Putting the broader results in line with respective market capitalizations, the overall use for each stablecoin is roughly in line with the rank of its respective market capitalization.”

“In the summer of 2018, we launched a comprehensive regulatory framework to provide clarity and leverage,” said Pitcher. “We introduced a principle-based framework that allowed us to define more of a scope around a business plan as opposed to specific activities. That allows you to have the flexibility to focus on managing risks of what’s new in this space.”

Pitcher hopes to create a system that allows Bermudians to spend the digital currency they receive on government services and, in so doing, build a bridge to overseas economies.

“By allowing the government to accept it, it provides an opportunity for merchants to start saying, ‘Well, I can look at accepting digital dollars,’” he said. “So taxi operators, tourism operators, commercial businesses have a place to actually spend, which means that you’re not going to have to fall back to the traditional financial system.”

Pitcher hopes these systems will finally introduce ordinary Bermudians into the global financial ecosystem.

“Our history allows us to really understand financial services,” he said. “But the challenge that comes from this is that when it comes to access to financial services, Bermudians are largely excluded. We don’t have access to PayPal, Revolut or Square and in order to actually get access to the Apple App Store we buy credit or gift cards.”

“We’re too small,” he said. “Nobody cares about 60,000 people.”","IRS Explains What Crypto Owners Must Know to File Taxes This Year

Kicking off this year’s tax filing season, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has published important tips for crypto owners to properly file their tax returns. This is the first time a cryptocurrency question has been included in the tax form. The IRS expects more than 150 million filers to reveal whether they acquired or disposed of any cryptocurrencies during the tax year.

IRS Kicks Off Tax Season

The IRS kicked off this year’s tax filing season last week with tips on how to file the 2019 tax returns. The deadline for filing and paying any tax owed is Wednesday, April 15. The agency expects more than 150 million individual tax returns to be filed.

Among the changes to the 2019 Form 1040, the main U.S. tax form, is the addition of “an inquiry regarding the acquisition or disposition of any virtual currency,” the agency explained. The new crypto question appears on Form 1040’s Schedule 1, entitled “Additional Income and Adjustments to Income.”

“Virtual currency is an important addition to the 1040 this year,” IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig commented. “This emerging area is a priority for the IRS, and we want to help taxpayers understand their obligations involving virtual currency. We will also take steps to ensure fair enforcement of the tax laws for those who don’t follow the rules involving virtual currency.” The tax agency elaborated:

In 2019, taxpayers who engaged in a transaction involving virtual currency will need to file Schedule 1 … The Internal Revenue Code and regulations require taxpayers to maintain records that support the information provided on tax returns.

The IRS clarified that taxpayers must keep records of “receipts, sales, exchanges or other dispositions of virtual currency and the fair market value of the virtual currency.” It further noted that taxpayers who did not engage in any crypto transactions in 2019 do not have to file Schedule 1 for this purpose. However, if they are already filing Schedule 1 for other non-crypto purposes, then check the “no” box for the crypto question.

Reporting Crypto Income

According to the instructions for Schedule 1, a transaction involving cryptocurrency includes “The receipt or transfer of virtual currency for free (without providing any consideration), including from an airdrop or following a hard fork; an exchange of virtual currency for goods or services; a sale of virtual currency; and an exchange of virtual currency for other property, including for another virtual currency.”

The agency explained that if a taxpayer received any cryptocurrencies as compensation for services or disposed of any coins held for sale to customers in a trade or business, they must report the income as they would report other income of the same type. For example, W-2 wages are reported on line 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Some are reported on Schedule C. Form 8949 will help with figuring out capital gain or loss, which will then be reported on Schedule D of Form 1040.

IRS Publication 525, entitled “Taxable and Nontaxable Income,” states:

If your employer gives you virtual currency (such as bitcoin) as payment for your services, you must include the FMV [fair market value] of the currency in your income.

“The FMV of virtual currency paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding, Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) tax, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) tax and must be reported on Form W-2,” the IRS emphasized.

The agency has provided two sets of guidance and FAQs on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies. The first guidance was issued in 2014 and the second in October 2019. The latter focuses largely on hard forks and airdrops. News.Bitcoin.com has also published a list of useful tax tools to help crypto owners.

Crypto Is ‘An Important Focal Point for the IRS in 2020’

In its Progress Update for the fiscal year 2019 published in January, the IRS explained that cryptocurrency is among the new and emerging compliance areas requiring its attention. Along with enforcement activities, it is providing outreach and education in these areas.

In 2019, the tax agency sent letters to more than 10,000 crypto owners suspected of possibly failing to report their crypto transactions properly, it detailed, adding that “The letters explained the tax obligations associated with virtual currency and describe how taxpayers can correct past filing and reporting errors.” Noting that “Voluntarily compliant taxpayers deserve to know that noncompliant taxpayers are at risk,” the agency declared:

Virtual currency, also called cryptocurrency, will remain an important focal point for the IRS in 2020.

But, this financial trend is changing, with there being banks that now charge consumers and businesses for storing money, something unheard of ten or twenty years ago.

This trend of money being expensive to hold could prove the value of Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and blockchain-based financial services that disincentivize certain behaviors.

ING forces negative interest rates on wealthy clients

Since the Great Recession of 2008, central banks have started to act in ways seemingly irrational compared to their traditional practices. These institutions have started pumping copious amounts of money into the economy through quantitative easing (or ” large-scale asset purchases”) and by decreasing interest rates, which are now at the lowest they’ve been at seemingly ever.

In some countries, the interest rate is effectively 0 percent, in other places, it’s a negative amount, meaning that certain lenders pay the borrower.

This is the case in the Netherlands, where the official long-term interest rate is -0.14 percent, per data from YCharts.

Banks, of course, have had to adjust for this. ING, one of the largest Dutch banks, revealed at the end of January that it will be charging an interest rate of -0.5 percent for wealthy clients with more than 1 million euros in their account. This will come into effect for businesses from April 1st and for private customers on July 1st. ING chalked up this move to the Netherland’s low rates:

“Due to persistent low and negative interest rates in the market.”

Second Dutch bank (ING) charges negative rates on savings account. – O.5 % on everything above €1 million euros. pic.twitter.com/vhkb9OZuk0 — VoimaGold.com (@JanGold_) February 1, 2020

Only 6,400 customers, the bank claims, will be affected by this move, but as rates have been decreasing for years now, it may be a precursor of what may come for mom and pop consumers.

Indeed, the bank confirmed that savings interest for accounts with a balance of up to 100,000 euros will receive a jaw-dropping (I’m kidding) 0.01 percent — effectively nothing. Zilch. Na da.

Enter Bitcoin, Crypto, DeFi

Enter Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

DeFi, arguably, is the easiest way to shoehorn crypto into the world of no yield on bank deposits.

Below is an image from LoanScan.io, a service that tracks platforms that offer loans of digital assets on Ethereum-based platforms and centralized platforms. As can be seen in the table, users can earn an interest rate of anywhere from 1.5 percent to 24 percent a year (rates are variable) by lending stablecoins and even Ethereum to platforms like dYdX, Compound, or Dharma.

Some services even allow clients in the U.S. to use their bank cards to deposit money directly into DeFi, lowering the barrier of entry to high-yielding Ethereum-based investment or savings opportunities.

There are also centralized solutions that help you put your crypto to good use, like the Galaxy Digital-funded BlockFi or Nexo, which both offer around an 8 percent interest rate on stablecoins that can be claimed for U.S. dollars.

If you don’t trust decentralized finance, which is admittedly currently in its earliest stages and thus open to attack vectors in the code, there’s also the option of mitigating negative interest rates by simply holding Bitcoin in a cold storage solution, safe from the hackers of the world.

Yes, Bitcoin doesn’t offer any yield and inflates with time, just like cash, but analysts say that it is becoming digital gold, so to speak, or a digital store of value that should theoretically hold its value over long swaths of time.

Banks are turning to crypto

The funny thing about all this is, the world’s banks and financial institutions are slowly turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ING included. Whether or not this is them acknowledging that the time of fiat is ending because of low interest rates isn’t clear, though.

ING, for instance, was revealed by Reuters to have started work on a crypto custody project. The company purportedly has other blockchain-related initiatives too, though details about those are scant.

Similarly, Fidelity Investments has launched a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trade execution and custody service for its institutional clients who hold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of wealth.

Banks turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a sign that they see a large amount of potential in this industry. Yet, it is somewhat antithetical to Bitcoin’s premise to be a decentralized, peer-to-peer movement.

Hanging in Canary Wharf, a financial district in London, on Friday was Ledger’s 7-by-4-meter digital billboard, reviving and modifying the controversial pro-Brexit slogan “take back control.”

Pascal Gauthier, Ledger’s CEO, said he was employing the phrase “to make a point about bitcoin.” There are similar values shared between the Brexit movement and crypto community, he said. But only crypto lets people “take back control for real,” as the advertisement read. The billboard was put up Friday for 24 hours.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

“We find it amusing that the same sentence, taking back control, can mean two different things,” Gauthier said in a phone call. “It’s a great moment to frame one of bitcoin’s taglines as an effective way to take back control over your money, digital secrets, and private key.”

The billboard is meant to challenge the nativism behind Brexit’s success. “Brexit means taking back control over borders and currency. It’s very U.K.-centric. Bitcoin is the opposite. It’s a borderless, global technology,” Gauthier said.

""Millions of people can't be wrong. Unless they're British.""

The executive is waiting to see how Brexit’s trade deals will affect his company going forward. Ledger opened a U.K. operation last quarter and employs several people in London, though does not have “a physical office at this time.”

Crypto exchange Bitpanda took a harder line on the U.K.’s departure.

“Personally, I think Brexit is a mistake,” said Eric Demuth, the Vienna-based co-CEO and founder. “I feel like many people do not see the great impact and were misled by the personal short-term goals of some politicians. No self-promoting politician should be a reason for anyone to be stripped of their freedoms.”

Ledger's ad.

Making light of this alleged political grift, Bitpanda shelled out for a multi-day advertising campaign reminding viewers that “millions of people can’t be wrong.”

Cryptocurrency exchanges process hundreds of millions of dollars worth of trades every day for millions of traders across the world. Most of us know how to fund our accounts and place orders to buy or sell the assets that we want, but do you really know how exchanges and order books work? Having an understanding of the mechanics behind order books can be a useful tool for traders to quickly assess a market and see what other traders are doing and thinking.

So What Is an Order Book?

If you view a market on an exchange, most of the time you’re shown a candlestick chart, an order book table and a depth chart. Candlestick charts allow us to see past trading activity, whereas order books and depth charts let us see a glimpse into the future and the minds of other traders at that current point in time. See the screenshot below from the Coinbase Pro BTC-USD market view, with the order order book on the left highlighted.

The order book is a real-time list of all outstanding orders that have been placed by other traders but haven’t yet been filled. That means that for every entry in the order book, there is one or more other traders with an open order for that exact price and amount. On the top in red are all of the open asks, or prices that that other sellers are asking for, and below in green are all of the open bids, or prices that other buyers are bidding to buy at.

Because these are all open orders, they let us see the prices that other people think they can get their orders filled at. This gives us an idea of where the market might go in the near future and what prices other people are speculating that the asset might be worth.

Those other traders have locked their funds up in these orders, meaning that if they have a buy order for 0.1 BTC at a rate of $9,000, that trader has $900 dedicated to that order that can’t be traded or transferred elsewhere. They’re putting their money on the line, so you can be sure that they are likely confident that the price will move in the direction they’ve predicted.

What Happens When You Place an Order?

Now that we have a basic understanding of what an order book is, let’s go through an example of what happens when you place two different types of orders, a market order and a limit order.

Market Orders

A market order is a simple type of order that will be executed immediately at the current market price. This doesn’t allow you to speculate about any specific price, you’re just buying or selling immediately at whatever the best available price is. As soon as you submit the order your trade will occur.

So how does the exchange know how to give you the best available price? It does this by using the order book. Let’s use the following example of a BTC-USD order book.

We can see that at this moment the lowest ask selling price by another trader is $8,900 (they’re looking to sell 1.5 BTC), and the highest bid buying price is $8,890. The last price, which is the price that the latest order on this market filled at recently, is $8,900. Let’s see what happens when we place a market order to buy 2 BTC.

The exchange is going to start at the ask order with the lowest price and fill that first, in order to ensure you get the best possible price. So you will buy all of the 1.5 BTC being sold for $8,900, but you placed an order for 2 BTC so there is still 0.5 BTC left in your order.

Since you filled the order for 1.5 at $8,900 (and some trader walked away with $13,350 given a price that they were happy to sell 1.5 BTC for), the exchange will now move on to the ask order with the next lowest price. Looking at the order book, we can see that is now the order selling 0.6 BTC at a rate of $8,950. Since you have 0.5 BTC left in your order, you will buy 0.5 of that 0.6 BTC, leaving 0.1 still open on the order book. Below is a demonstration of those orders by other traders that you will fill:

And here is what the order book will look like after your order is complete (although in the real world traders and trading bots are constantly submitting new orders, so the order book can potentially be updating tens or hundreds of times per second on an active market):

At this point we’ve purchased the 2 BTC that we wanted. We purchased 1.5 BTC at $8,900, and 0.5 BTC at $8,950, giving us a total cost of (8900 * 1.5) + (8950 * .5) which equals $17,825. If we average the two orders, we bought at an average rate of $8,912.50. The last price has now changed to $8,950 since that was the price of the latest order that you filled.

Limit Orders

A limit order is another type of order that is a bit more sophisticated than a market order. Unlike market orders, which just buy or sell at whatever the best possible rate is immediately, limit orders allow traders to specify a price that they want to buy or sell at, allowing them to speculate on what the price may be in the future. For example, a buying bid limit order for BTC at rate of $9,000 will only execute at a price of $9,000 or better (lower). In contrast, a selling ask limit order will for BTC at a rate of $9,100 will only execute at a price of $9,100 or better (higher).

Limit orders have their advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that you get to specify the price you want. The disadvantages are that there’s no guarantee the order will ever be filled (if the price never reaches that point then it can’t ever be filled), that your money or coins will be locked up in this order (you won’t be able to use it for anything else), and that there’s no guarantee your entire order will be filled. You might have placed a limit order to buy 0.5 BTC, but only end up buying 0.3 BTC.

For this example we’ll use the same order book that we started with previously:

Say your order is to buy 1 BTC with a bid limit order at a price of $8,800. Since the current lowest ask selling price is $8,900 (which is above $8,800) your order will not be filled because the price hasn’t reached the level that you want. So your order will be inserted into the order book like below.

If the price does eventually reach $8,800 by other people filling the higher priced bid orders, for example if someone placed a market order to sell 4.5 BTC (0.5 + 1 + 3, the sizes of the open bid orders at prices higher than yours in the order book), then your order will now be the highest priced bid.

At that point, if someone were to place a market sell order your buy order for 1 BTC would be the first order that the exchange would fill. If that other trader’s market order were for less than your total order amount, say a market sell order for 0.4 BTC, your order would remain in the order book with 0.6 BTC left to be filled.

Gaining Insights by Analyzing Order Books

That was a lot of information but I hope you now have a better understanding of what’s going on behind the scenes at an exchange when you place an order. The above examples are simplified to demonstrate the high level concepts of what an exchange does, but they should provide you a basic enough comprehension to now be able to understand how we can gain some helpful insights by looking at an order book.

Depth Charts

A depth chart is a very common way to visualize an order book. Let’s look at this example, again from the Coinbase Pro BTC-USD market:

This shows all of the open orders, bid buy orders are on the left in green and ask sell orders are on the right in red. The x-axis below the chart shows the price, and the y-axis on the left and right sides is the total cumulative number of BTC locked up in orders.

For each order (or price level if multiple orders exist at the same price) that is found in the order book, the depth chart adds that order’s amount (size) to the y-axis, increasing its height at that order’s price on the x-axis. So each increase in height that you see represents a single entry in the order book, meaning a larger increase in height means there is a larger amount in an order at that price.

If we hover over the bid portion of the chart at the 200 point on the y-axis, we see this:

This shows us that between the current last price of $9,020.10 and the price of $8,947.97, there are a number of different orders that in total contain ~200 BTC (the y-axis value at our cursor). It also shows us that in order to move the price down to $8,947.97 one would have to sell $1,991,329.63 worth of BTC, since that would fill every order between that and the last price.

Buy Walls and Sell Walls

A more interesting example of a depth chart is when we see a buy wall or a sell wall. By searching through the markets on Coinbase Pro I was able to find an example of a buy wall on the XLM-EUR market, see the screenshot below:

In comparison to the BTC-USD depth chart we looked at previously, which had a fairly constant upwards slope on both sides, this chart shows sharp increases in height. On the left bid side we see a large vertical increase at €0.0540 on the x-axis.

That means that there is a significant amount of money tied up in open buy orders at the price of €0.0540, so once the price reaches that level it could potentially take dozens or hundreds of other traders placing sell orders at that price to completely fill that order and move the price past that order’s price level. These walls provide an indicator that this could be a potential area of resistance, as it will take a comparatively large amount of money to move past that price point in the order book.

Order Book Superiority

Another helpful tool for assessing an order book is order book superiority analysis, such as that available in the Coygo application. Below is an screenshot of Coygo’s order book superiority analysis for the same Coinbase Pro BTC-USD market:

In this example, order book superiority is analyzing all open orders in the order book within 5% of the last price. This is done to avoid outliers and provide an analysis of the orders that have potential to be relevant in the near future.

On the left we can see that all bids with a rate within 5% of the last price are shown to have a cumulative total amount of 907.1201 BTC, with 798 different entries in the order book, which is 60.82% of the total amount of all orders (bids and asks combined) within the price range. On the right, all asks with a rate within 5% of the last price add up to a total amount of 584.2782 BTC, with 1347 entries in the order book, which is 39.18% of the total amount of all orders within the price range.

In the center we see that the total amount of BTC in all bids and asks combined is 1,491.3984 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $11,834,410.7533 given the current last price. Below that we see two horizontal bars representing the total amount of BTC locked up in bid orders in the green horizontal bar and ask orders in the red horizontal bar, and finally below that it shows that the order book superiority favors bids with a difference of 21.64% between the total cumulative amount of BTC locked up in bids compared to asks.

We can learn a number of things from this simplified visualization of the order book. The most obvious is that at this exact moment, traders are committing more money to buy orders than sell orders. This can show us that there may be more sentiment by traders thinking the price might go down to a lower price since they’re hoping to buy, but it can also be deceiving as perhaps only one very wealthy trader placed a larger sized order. That appears to be the case in this example, if we look at the number of entries we see that although there is 21.64% more BTC locked up in bids than asks, the total number of bid order book entries is much smaller, 798 compared to 1347 for asks.

Combining the two tools above, depth charts and order book superiority analysis, can provide a very quick but detailed assessment of the current state of a market’s order book. This in turn can tell you where other traders think the price might be moving, how much money is being committed by other traders at certain price levels, where areas of resistance might exist, and even if a market is potentially being manipulated by a small number of very wealthy traders.

This has just been a basic introduction to how order books operate on cryptocurrency exchanges and how you can read and visualize them to gain insights that put you at an advantage over others who don’t have as good of an understanding of how markets work. Good luck trading!

2020-02-03,"Cryptocurrency is a potentially great digital asset for investment. Some cryptocurrencies have better options for investment in 2020. Do you want to know what digital currencies are worth investing your money in the next 12 months? Read the following recommendations.

Factors to consider when choosing a cryptocurrency for investing in 2020

Despite the international trend of cryptocurrency devaluation in 2019, some coins still possess a very good potential for making quick and long-term ROI. Do not pay attention only to the current rate of cryptocurrencies because this index is the most volatile and may change drastically within a few weeks (take, for instance, the dramatic drop of Bitcoin price in 2018). On the contrary, consider the following factors and indicators:

Market capitalization – the value of all issued digital coins of the particular cryptocurrency. High market cap means a large volume of the crypto coins participating in active transactions, which means an enhanced interest of investors;

Liquidity level – the higher it is, the faster a cryptocurrency can be sold at the market price. The most popular cryptocurrencies – Ethereum, Bitcoin and Ripple – have a high liquidity rate. Trading activity on exchanges indicates the number of transactions with certain cryptos made over a certain period. This indicator shows an actual demand in particular cryptocurrencies among traders;

Rules to learn before investing in cryptocurrencies in 2020

According to AMarkets expert Artem Deev, the following recommendations will help to minimize risks and increase ROI for cryptocurrency investors this year:

Diversify your investments – never invest money in one asset. New traders and investors make this mistake repeatedly and, as a result, lose all money after the first failing deal. Diversify your investment portfolio. At least one of the chosen cryptocurrencies will bring profits and you will be able to minimize losses;

Do not blindly trust one source of data – always use a few sources (chats, forums, expert opinion, financial analysis, brokers);

Learn and observe – it is the only way to pick the best cryptocurrencies and the entry point to this extremely volatile market;

Top 5 cryptocurrencies to invest in 2020:

Story continues

1. Bitcoin

In May 2020, the first and major cryptocurrency developers will offer 50% reduced rewards – 6.25 BTC instead of 12.5 BTC for each verified block. However, apart from that, Bitcoin is likely to bring the dominance index to 65-70% compared to other altcoins. In such a way, it can become the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization. These factors may significantly affect the growth of its price in 2020. Active use of Lightning Network may also change the BTC ecosystem. It will enable the implementation of Bitcoin in decentralized applications, micropayments, and e-commerce platforms. The current Bitcoin price (January 28, 2020) is $8 994,85.

2. Ethereum

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is based on practical smart contracts used by many projects for the digitalization of transactions. The currency value may increase due to the increasing demand for its blockchain and functions, rather than a deficit of the asset as it happens with BTC right now. A major role in the success or failure of this currency will depend on upcoming fork updates and rapid implementation of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm. The approval by regulatory organizations and community decision to de-list ETH from the list of altcoins may also affect its price growth in 2020. The current ETH price is $171,38.

3. NEO

The NEO project is often included in different cryptocurrency investment ratings for the next year. This cryptocurrency breaks many stereotypes, including being the first open-source token originated from China. It claims to transform the traditional financial system by combining digital and real assets. Its unique Superconduct trading mechanism allows users to trust the funds through a decentralized platform. So, NEO’s appliance is beyond doubt, as its rapid demand growth. NEO may even hold an ICO, but so far it is trading at the level of $11,14 USD per token. The current NEO price is $11,14.

4. EOS

Chinese experts, according to CoinTelegraph, really like to include EOS to the list of the most promising cryptocurrencies for the next few years. Even if you don’t know much about crypto coins, it is definitely worth your investment in 2020. If Twitter, Uber, and Amazon ever move to a blockchain, the core of their work will definitely be EOS. The EOS system is free of Ethereum problems with scalability and it is ready to replace other competitive blockchains. If Ethereum fails, EOS can level up to 100 USD per token. EOS achievements become possible thanks to the consensus algorithm of delegated proof of ownership (DPoS) and an infinite number of similar blockchains. The current EOS price is $3,94.

5. Ripple

Some experts call XRP the “king of banking infrastructure”. The successful partnership with major financial market players made the Ripple ecosystem a breakthrough in the crypto industry. Take the latest integration with Western Union and the potential replacement of SWIFT to accelerate and reduce the cost of large money transfers between counterparties. However, do not expect huge profits with XRP in 2020, it is good for long-term investment. Even with the most optimistic approach, XRP price is unlikely to rise above 0.7 USD in the next couple of years. The current XRP price is $0,233759.

Cheap but potentially good for investment cryptocurrencies in 2020

Besides the obvious choices of popular cryptocurrencies, one of AMarkets experts – Basil Gamov – recommends to take a closer look at cheap but potentially great cryptocurrencies to invest in the next 12 months:

1) Chainlink (LINK) – appeared in 2017 in the USA. These crypto coins developed a technology that forms channels between different data providers employing smart blockchain technology. Chainlink allows all network operators, like information providers, to earn their token LINK. From an investment point of view, Chainlink has great potential. This is the list of partners who also believe in this crypto coin’s future: Dapps Inc, Google Cloud, ETHA, ConsenSys. The price (January 28, 2020) is $2,62. The market cap is $917 350 826.

2) Basic Attention Token (BAT) is another functional type of tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is used only in the Brave browser. The cryptocurrency was launched in 2015. Developers offer a various concept of interaction for all network participants. Browser users pick to choose ads or not and can monitor the token’s price in real-time via Brave. The token has a very active and massive affiliate program, has the support of the Tor browser and DuckDuckGo search engine. The current token price is $0,218456. The market cap is $311 019 624.

3) Synthetix Network Token (SNX) is a potentially interesting platform network based on the ERC20 token. It helps to create synthetic assets (Synths) for tracking the value of physical assets. People can create and support their Synths and make money with them, without actually being the owners of these assets. The token appeared in 2017 and back then it was called Havven. The current token price is $1,19. The market cap is $193 220 205.

Final thoughts

Sure, you are free to pick any cryptocurrency to invest in 2020. Remember to diversify and work with reliable exchange services and brokers to protect your investment deals from any fraud. Make sure to include crypto coins into your asset portfolio as soon as possible while top currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are still hot for investment.

More From FXEMPIRE:","Elon Musk has raised concerns about the ""dire problem"" of cryptocurrency scams on Twitter.

The Tesla CEO has been consistently targeted by scammers in recent years, who use fake accounts to impersonate him and trick people into sending them cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.

Scams typically involve fake accounts holding ""giveaways"", which require people to send cryptocurrency to a digital address in order to receive a greater amount in return.

Analysis by The Independent in 2018 found that more than 400 people sent thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency to scammers, however Musk claims the problem is even worse now.

""The crypto scam level on Twitter is reaching new levels. This is not cool,"" he tweeted to his 31 million followers. ""Troll/ bot networks on Twitter are a dire problem for adversely affecting public discourse and ripping people off.""

","Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have co-developed technology they say can help avoid congestion on off-chain cryptocurrency payments networks.

The “Spider” crypto routing scheme, according to its developers – including Vibhaalakshmi Sivaraman, a graduate student at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) – offers a more efficient type of payment channel network, or PCN.

Used on “layer 2” scaling solutions like bitcoin’s lightning network, PCNs allow users to charge accounts with a chosen amount of cryptocurrency. Payments are made across a network of such accounts and only the setting up and closing of the accounts is registered on the blockchain.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

This can result in payments that are far faster and more scalable than those made directly on the blockchain, and is touted as a way to make crypto payments more feasible in bricks-and-mortar stores. Bitcoin transactions, for example, currently take on average roughly 11 minutes to be confirmed on the network, though the figure has sometimes peaked at over 15 minutes. Lightning is said to take from milliseconds to seconds, by contrast.

According to a CSAIL report on Spider, PCNs can be slowed by inefficient routing schemes, and often quickly run down users’ accounts, meaning they are forced to top up their funds frequently.

Spider is claimed to be a more efficient way of routing payments, in which participants can invest just a fraction of funds in their account. It’s also said to be able to process around four times the number of transactions, compared with other PCNs, before registering the events on the blockchain.

Spider works by splitting transactions into smaller amounts or “packets” that propagate over different channels at varying rates, CSAIL writes. By dividing the amounts into bite-sized chunks, large payments can be routed through accounts that may have low funding levels. Unlike with other systems that will send the full payment and possibly be rejected by accounts with insufficient funds – thus causing delays as the transaction is rerouted – Spider can produce payments that are less likely to clog up the network or fail, its team say.

“Routing money in a way that the funds of both users in each joint account are balanced allows us to reuse the same initial funds to support as many transactions as possible,” Sivaraman said.

The routing system was inspired by packet switching, a method of efficiently transmitting data over the web.

Another feature of the tech is it allows payments to be queued at congested accounts rather than being rejected, while the team also built an algorithm they say can help spot congested accounts.

In tests looking at how it handles one-directional payments where an account becomes depleted and needs to be topped up on the blockchain, the team says Spider can also outperform other PCN systems.

The researchers aim to present a paper on Spider at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation later this month.

“It’s important to have balanced, high-throughput routing in PCNs to ensure the money that users put into joint accounts is used efficiently,” said lead author Sivaraman. “This should be efficient and a lucrative business. That means routing as many transactions as possible, with as little funds as possible, to give PCNs the best bang for their buck.”","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) has been shrouded in mystery. Some have labeled the development as a tracking tool for an authoritarian government. Others have been more generous.

Both groups can, however, agree on one point: it’s nothing like Bitcoin.

Don’t Call it a Cryptocurrency

A recent document found by a Chinese think tank suggests that the People’s Bank of China will track customer fund flow and use big data analytics to collect and process large amounts of transactional information passing through the database.

Although they claim to preserve user privacy in the process, the document clearly outlines that the commercial partners have the ability to track cash flows within the scope of their own users.

While it isn’t mentioned in the document, the very existence of such a system means the central bank has access to the entire system, just as the central bank of any country can track remittances back to a particular user within their country.

Matthew Graham, CEO of Sino Global Capital, an investment firm focused on blockchain technologies in Asia, told Crypto Briefing in an email that calling the DCEP a data scraping project is “misleading.”

Instead, said Graham, “one could argue that the DCEP represents the next era of central banking, where monetary policy decisions are increasingly based on detailed real-time information.”

This could help policymakers in the country make better decisions.

Chinese authorities will analyze payment behavior to gain a better understanding of currency circulation in the economy, as well as track down and weed out potential money launderers. A side effect of this is centralized control of the network.

This feature is also in line with how China operates politically. Whenever the country begins to pursue an objective, “their top-down structure ensures that the regulatory and legal path is clear and plans are executed rapidly,” said Graham.

Moreover, the central bank has publicly accepted this is a closed system, drawing on the example of Bitcoin to differentiate between a decentralized digital currency and centrally-managed currency.

Graham said that this decision was likely due to blockchain technology’s inability to scale. He added:

“Given this structure, it is not accurate to call it a cryptocurrency, even though it was announced that the DCEP wallets would likely employ distributed tech and public-private key cryptography when setting up user accounts. Thus it is important to distinguish between a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and a digital currency such as DCEP.”

Many new features have been included in the currency’s design, including anti-spam protection and offline transactions. The central bank is likely to roll out a dedicated wallet, either independently or through its commercial banking partners.

Issuance will be solely at the discretion of the People’s Bank of China. Banking partners will have to deposit a certain amount of money with the central bank and will be given an equivalent amount in digital currency.

These commercial entities can then disseminate the digital currency to the public and will be in charge of circulation and liquidity.

China’s commercial banking system will be kept intact and used as it is. This new digital currency aims to replace coins, banknotes, and other money equivalents that can easily be converted to cash with this new digital currency.

If this happens, financial privacy in the country will be under further attack as one of the remaining private forms of money ⁠— cash ⁠— is eliminated from the system.","How To Buy Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies Using Paypal

Buying Cryptos With Paypal

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is 11 years old and there are more ways than ever to purchase and obtain cryptocurrencies in 2020. Some trading platforms allow users to pay with debit and credit cards and with bank transfers as well. But there’s also a slew of businesses that allow people to purchase bitcoin and other cryptos with the Paypal payment processor.

In order to make your first cryptocurrency purchase by leveraging Paypal, you obviously need a Paypal account. You also need to register with a trading platform or brokerage service that sells digital currencies like BTC, BCH, and ETH with Paypal. There’s a good number of services that allow users to pay for their cryptos with the payment provider. Lastly, you will also need a cryptocurrency wallet that supports the digital asset you want to purchase. Bitcoin.com’s wallet is an excellent noncustodial wallet solution that allows you to store, send, and receive both BTC and BCH.

Using an Exchange

A lot of individuals use the exchange Coinbase ever since they added the ability for customers to link their Paypal and Coinbase accounts. Depending on where you live you can purchase or sell Coinbase listed digital assets using the Paypal system. If you want to use Coinbase in order to utilize Paypal, then you must complete all of the identity verification procedures issued by the San Francisco firm. After your identity is confirmed with Coinbase, go to the “settings” section and then “linked accounts.”

Simply click the “new account” tab and choose Paypal and the Coinbase dashboard will prompt you to log in to Paypal. After all these steps are complete, you can then purchase and sell digital assets with Paypal using the exchange. However, you can only link your Paypal account to one Coinbase account, the company’s guidelines note.

Using a Peer-to-Peer Marketplace

Another way to use Paypal in order to obtain cryptocurrencies is by using the peer-to-peer marketplace Local.Bitcoin.com. If you want to buy bitcoin cash (BCH) with Paypal you can register and log into your Local.Bitcoin.com account and press the “trades” tab. This will give you access to the “find an offer” and “create an offer” tabs.

In the find an offer section, you can simply search for people selling BCH that accept Paypal for payments. Or, if you are planning to sell BCH, you can head over to the create an offer section and create one that accepts Paypal for payments. Looking at the worldwide listings on the BCH marketplace shows that there’s a great number of buyers and sellers who use Paypal. Other localized exchanges like Paxful, Localbitcoins, and Localcryptos (formally Localethereum) also let traders use Paypal.

Weighing the Pros and Cons

Other trading services that allow you to purchase digital currencies via Paypal include Etoro, Xcoins, Cancoin, Cryptonit, and Wirex. Every platform and exchange has pros and cons when it comes to buying cryptocurrencies with Paypal. For instance some services, like certain peer-to-peer marketplaces, offer better privacy and you don’t need identity verification to trade with Paypal.

However, a bunch of the aforementioned companies do require account verification and KYC procedures like submitting a photo ID or proof-of-residence. Similar to Coinbase, in order to leverage Paypal with Wirex, you need to submit identification documents to deposit USD and be able to select the Paypal option. Most of the platforms that require identification will simply let you tether a Paypal account to the exchange as soon as you pass the verification services process.

It’s likely that anonymity won’t be a big deal to people who want to use Paypal to purchase cryptos because the Paypal system itself is not really anonymous or private. If ID verification is an issue, people can always utilize trading platforms like Local.Bitcoin.com for more privacy. With more than 260 million active Paypal users today, there’s definitely a number of individuals who want to purchase or sell digital currencies like ethereum or bitcoin cash with the payment service.

According to BitPay Chief Marketing Officer Bill Zielke, the payment processor facilitated $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions in 2019, with bitcoin leading the pack. Likewise, a Coinbase spokesperson said Coinbase Commerce processed $135 million worth of cryptocurrency payments for thousands of merchants in 2019, which represents a 600 percent increase in the number of unique transactions via Coinbase Commerce since 2018.

Ether and various stablecoins make up a small percentage of both of the above-mentioned totals, with Chainalysis reportedly estimating roughly $4 billion in bitcoin alone was sent through payment processors in 2019. As such, Coinbase is looking to build out its merchant services in 2020.

Of course, the number for credit card payments is much higher, dwarfing bitcoin’s $4 billion purchasing power. Credit card purchase volume in 2018 was $3.7 trillion, according to a 2019 report from the U.S. Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.

“In 2020, we’re hyper-focused on providing a complete merchant experience with business features and insights, better serving other geographies with internationalization, adding more currencies, and building seamless integrations that leverage other Coinbase products,” Coinbase Commerce lead Sahil Amoli told CoinDesk.

Among consumer-facing companies, Fold CEO Will Reeves said his shopping app processed more than 2,000 purchases during the 2019 holiday shopping season, out of which 80 percent were Lightning Network transactions.

“Amazon, Starbucks, Sephora were the most gifted brands by lightning users,” Reeves said.

Another option for merchants also emerged on the scene last week, in the form of Zap’s Strike, an application that lets users make U.S. dollar payments via the lightning network.

Tales from the cash register

All things considered, there’s ample reason to be cautiously optimistic about bitcoin usage beyond speculative trading in 2020. However, Lola Luna boutique owner Jean-Michel Daumas, a Coinbase Commerce customer who runs a luxury lingerie business in Paris, warned it’s still too soon to describe bitcoin payments as routine or trendy.

“People are not ready to pay with crypto. They prefer to keep it rather than spend it,” Daumas said. “I prefer to receive payments in crypto because they are more secure for me. For example, when I receive payments from PayPal, some people cheat and say they didn’t receive the goods.”

Daumas said his boutique received more than 90 bitcoin payments since early 2018, never more than four bitcoin payments a month. His customers are 80 percent men spending bitcoin on lingerie as a status symbol, an insight that aligns with BitPay’s findings that jewelry, precious metals and high-end tech products garner the most bitcoin buyers.

“It’s a very high level of fabric, couture-level,” he said. “We sell much more during the Christmas holidays, for example, [which] has much more influence [on the store’s sales trends] than the price of bitcoin.”

Indeed, Lola Luna is best known for statement pieces such as open G-string bottoms with dangling feathers to tickle sensitive areas. Perhaps some shoppers may choose to pay with bitcoin so that a “naked bra” and lace collar set doesn’t show up on a credit card bill. But, given French lingerie culture, Daumas said it’s “too early” to conclude why some shoppers prefer using bitcoin.

For broader context, BitPay’s Zielke said Europe and the Middle East are generally home to the most high-value merchant transactions, while there are more North American shoppers in terms of unique transactions. In the meantime, Daumas prefers to simply transfer the bitcoin earnings to a hardware wallet and hodl.","Line's Digital Currency Link to Be Available in Japan as Early as April 2020

Launched in October 2018, Asian messaging giant Line’s Bitbox crypto exchange has made its link (LN) digital asset available to users worldwide, with the exception of notable locations like Japan and the U.S. Last Thursday the group announced it was preparing to launch the coin in the Japanese market, compliant with the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). Though full details are not yet disclosed, a press release from Line details that the digital currency could be available to traders in Japan as soon as April 2020.

Link to Arrive in Japanese Market

Though the Line messaging app and payment service are popular in Japan, the Line corporation’s digital currency link (LN) has not yet been made available to the domestic market due to regulatory issues. In a press release posted Thursday Line announced:

Since launching on the BITBOX cryptocurrency exchange on October 16, 2018, LINK has been available to users worldwide except in Japan and the United States. Concurrently, LVC [Line subsidiary] has been preparing to roll out the coins in the Japanese market in accordance with the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association’s (JVCEA) official process to handle new digital currency.

The exact date of launch is not known but the release details, “The coin’s official release date (currently scheduled to be in as early as April 2020) will be announced separately once it is determined.”

Line’s Bitbox exchange is at present unavailable to residents of Japan, but the press release notes that “LVC is currently developing a system in preparation for LINK’s debut in Japan.” It is unclear whether the Bitbox exchange itself will be regulated and made available to the Japanese market. However, Line’s in-app exchange service Bitmax, launched in September last year, is available in the country, and a separate announcement will be made when link is available on that platform, according to the release.

Regulatory Hurdles for Multiple Social Apps

Like link, other projects such as Telegram’s gram and Facebook’s libra currencies are no stranger to legal barriers. As electronic money and crypto redefine what currency is and innovate its potential use cases, regulators worldwide appear to be struggling to deal with the rapid progress.

In October, Telegram chose to delay launch of its TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain in light of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing suit against the group, claiming the gram token is a security. The company had also refused to disclose financial information to the regulator, however this demand for disclosure was reportedly rejected by the New York Southern District Court in early January.

Facebook’s libra sees its latest struggles in big time players exiting the Libra Association, some of whom are likely influenced by the project’s ongoing regulatory entanglements.

Finally, popular Canadian messaging app Kik announced its own woes in September last year, pointing to an imminent shutdown in light of channeling resources to an SEC court battle for the sake of its own crypto known as “kin.” It’s in this broad milieu of turbulent relationships between new crypto projects and regulators that link will roll out in Japan. With the approval of the JVCEA, however, things can likely be expected to go more smoothly for Line’s digital asset. Whether the token will eventually arrive in the U.S. thanks to the development remains to be seen.

Opinion on cryptoassets is polarised even if the ‘plumbing’, in the form of blockchain technology, is now widely accepted.

Cryptocurrencies are booming globally and moving closer to the mainstream

Investors face a large amount of hype and misinformation about crypto assets

Cryptocurrencies may be useful as a diversifier in a portfolio

When Bitcoin is the subject of fervent discussion among financial practitioners it is easy to draw the conclusion that in 2020 there will be continuing volatility in crypto-related assets. Yet the real problem for institutional investors is that, while there may be potential uses and attractions, they are hidden underneath an immense amount of misinformation and hype.

“When institutions begin to consider cryptocurrency a legitimate asset class it will lead to a situation where individual savers have a proportion of their pensions held in a digital currency or invested in digital assets,” says David Mercer, the CEO of LMAX Exchange, a financial technology firm. “Even if it only starts out as a percentage point or two it will lead to extremely significant in-flows into the asset class.”

The current size of the crypto-asset market, according to Aaro Capital, a company that facilitates investment in the technology, is about $200bn (€180bn) compared with $18bn at the beginning of 2017. In the past three years over 500 funds have been launched in the distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and crypto-assets sector.

Bitcoin has made the initial investors millionaires or even billionaires, at least on paper. But if, as appears to be the case, most of the market capitalisation of Bitcoin is held by a tiny number of initial investors, most later investors face a serious risk of massive losses.

The initial controlling investors need to sell their Bitcoin investments to monetise their value. Selling requires an ever-increasing number of willing buyers. For an asset that produces zero income, and whose increasing value is solely determined by increasing numbers of buyers, it smacks of a Ponzi scheme. Initial investors, whether the famed Winklevoss twins – who, it seems, may have owned 1% or so of Bitcoin at one stage – or others, would have to find willing buyers to monetise paper gains. Any large-scale selling by large investors is likely to trigger a selling panic.

The one type of investor who will definitely generate profits from the crypto boom are those who have adopted the philosophy of the famed sellers of shovels during the California gold boom and provide services in the form of exchanges and the like for crypto-related transactions. But even here there can be confusion on the value that they can provide to institutional investors.

There are two key questions facing institutional investors if they want to be involved in crypto assets. First, what are the requirements in terms of credit intermediation, regulation and infrastructure and cost.

Second, and more importantly, what should be the role of crypto assets within a portfolio?

LMAX’s Mercer argues that there needs to be an internationally trusted marketplace for institutional-only cryptocurrency trading. “We need banks with sizeable balance sheets to start acting as trusted central credit counterparties to provide traditional fund managers or hedge funds with the funds to implement their strategies and trades on the direction of cryptocurrencies.”

But, as Max Boonen, CEO and founder of B2C2, one of the largest cryptocurrency liquidity providers, argues, the main premise of a crypto-currency is that there are no intermediaries in a transaction: “It is an ‘asset’ that cannot be taken away from you but the problem is that as a store of value it is extremely volatile.”

For institutions, though, there is another key question: are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin assets akin to others within a pension fund portfolio? “If you think are currencies, they are not assets – pension funds don’t buy currencies to speculate, they buy assets that happen to be denominated in a specific currency,” Boonen says. “No-one in their right mind would want their pension funds invested in Bitcoin because currencies are not assets.”

Pension funds are not in the business of trading currencies for speculative gains by betting on the direction of cryptocurrencies. It is therefore unclear what role a cryptocurrency offering zero yield would have within an institutional portfolio except as a source of diversification, alongside other volatile but zero-yielding commodities.

Yet despite their volatility and uneven infrastructure, cryptocurrencies are moving ever closer to the mainstream. Ankush Jain, a partner at Aaro Capital, says this is happening in well-regulated countries such as the UK, where financial regulations have been reviewing them, Germany, where legislation has been proposed to enable banks to handle cryptocurrencies, and Switzerland, which has led the way in establishing crypto exchanges. High profile institutions such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are also taking the sector seriously.

Crypto asset advocates such as Jain argue that their volatility presents opportunities in a world where return expectations across almost all established asset classes are depressed. Cryptocurrencies also have almost no correlation to other asset classes, and therefore provide clear diversification benefits. For institutional investment, Jain sees several possibilities:

• Direct investments: these can be risky, however, especially when investing in larger amounts, given storage and execution risks.

• Futures: available if one has the expertise to trade them

• Passive funds: for example, through exchange-traded products. These offer capacity but are a blunt instrument. They have concentration risk (because of the dominance, for the time being, of Bitcoin)

• Active hedge funds: Jain argues these are a better option because of the inefficiencies presented by the market: “Active, agile approaches can best exploit return opportunities and manage risk effectively. They are often small and difficult to source and diligence.”

• Venture capital funds: these can offer purer forms of DLT exposure, but often have long lockups.

• Multi-managers: these can offer a diversified portfolio of active managers that employ a range of different strategies.

Different cryptocurrencies possess varying levels of monetary properties which, in turn, affect their relative usability as money. For investors, the challenge with investing in any crypto-currency is that the main argument that drives investment in Bitcoin is that the supply of Bitcoin is limited. That may be true, but the supply of cryptocurrencies as a whole is unlimited, with no substantial barriers to entry.

Ido Sadeh Man, founder of Saga Monetary Technologies, points out that the cryptosphere is populated with cryptocurrency products – all geared towards delivering value through their approach to solving different issues – but their value is not being driven by demand for cryptocurrency per se, but by user demand for the solution they provide. “It’s correct to say that barriers to creation are low, he says. “But it’s what comes after creation that really sets them apart from each other, and exercises and demonstrates where their true value proposition lies.”

Like any form of money, the value of a cryptocurrency is derived from a combination of the usefulness of its money-like properties and subsequent network effects. Unlike traditional currencies, larger cryptocurrencies are secured by their network value, points out Jain. The higher the value, the harder it is to attack the network. But that still leaves the issue that cryptocurrencies may have as much long-term stability as tulips in 17th century Netherlands as a store of value. For long-term institutional investors, that is still a deal breaker.

One development that may change that is the creation of so-called ‘stable currencies’ which are linked to more stable baskets of currencies or commodities. Linkages to fiat currencies naturally mean that the cryptocurrencies are no longer decentralised as there are implicit links to the monetary policies of the issuing countries in the currency basket.

Facebook with its Libra electronic currency is leading a new trend – that of corporations issuing their own units of exchange linked to baskets of assets. Whether that will take off remains to be seen. But for central banks and institutional investors it adds further complexity to an already difficult set of challenges.","Matthew is the editor of SHIFT.

Hello Forkers, welcome to Moonday Mornings, Hard Fork’s wrap-up of the weekend’s top cryptocurrency and blockchain headlines you can’t afford to miss!

Let’s see what happened this week:

1. Cybercriminals use Kobe Bryant wallpaper to cyptojack victims

According to researchers at Microsoft’s Security Intelligence division, cybercriminals embedded a coin mining script in a digital wallpaper featuring the recently deceased basketball star Kobe Bryant.

While the world mourns the loss of an NBA legend, cybercriminals are, as expected, taking advantage of the tragedy. We found a malicious HTML file posing as a Kobe Bryant wallpaper that contains a coin mining script. pic.twitter.com/w2JwPvqFy5 — Microsoft Security Intelligence (@MsftSecIntel) January 30, 2020

Documented in a series of tweets last week, Microsoft says its Defender SmartScreen blocks the script after identifying it as a Trojan virus. It’s not clear if the unscrupulous scammers have managed to profit by exploiting Bryant’s passing.

2. Ex-NFL mogul rejects plea deal over cryptocurrency laundering charges

Reginald Fowler, a former stakeholder of the Minnesota Vikings NFL team, who was arrested for allegedly running an unlicensed money transfer business used for cryptocurrency exchange deposits turned down a plea offer presented by prosecutors.

Fowler was reportedly set to plead guilty to a single felony on the grounds that he would forfeit $371 million held in more than 50 different accounts, BNN Bloomberg writes.

However, the accused said they would only agree to forfeit whatever assets currently sit in the accounts.

3. Luxembourg’s financial regulator warns of illicit cryptocurrency business

The Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) in Luxembourg issued a warning for a suspicious cryptocurrency business last week. According to a CSSF announcement, Crypto Bull is operating out of offices based in Luxembourg, but has not registered with the regulator.

The country’s financial regulator was one of the first to grant operating licenses to businesses that deal in cryptocurrency in an attempt to better regulate the space. In other words, avoid or at least tread with extreme caution when dealing with unlicensed cryptocurrency businesses in the country.

4. No, Bitcoin ETFs are not coming anytime soon

A year ago, with rising institutional interest, it seemed possible that a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) would be approved by US regulators. But that doesn’t appear to be the case anymore.

According to The Block 2020 Outlook Survey, most respondents don’t believe we’ll see a Bitcoin ETF approved this year, The Block reports.

106 individuals from venture capital firms, financial services businesses, and other companies in the digital asset space took part in the survey. More than 77 percent responded “no” when asked if a Bitcoin ETF would be approved in the US this year.

And finally…

5. Twitter adds a Bitcoin emoji

Twitter figurehead Jack Dorsey tweeted the Bitcoin emoji yesterday and “Crypto-Twitter” is going wild. Anytime the #bitcoin hashtag is used, Twitter now automatically adds a Bitcoin emoji immediately after (you may need to click through to see the emoji on Twitter‘s app or site).

Dorsey also took the opportunity to CC in Unicode, the Twitter account for industry standards in how computer text is represented on screens. But according to Emojipedia, the Bitcoin sign was added to Unicode 10.0 in 2017, as a character, but not an emoji.

Either way, Twitter has a Bitcoin emoji now.

Now go get on with your week of furiously tweeting the Bitcoin emoji."

The U.S. government has opened registration for the bidding of over 4,040 bitcoins, currently worth more than $37 million, which will be auctioned off on Feb. 18. The winning bidder will be notified on the same day. These bitcoins were forfeited in various federal criminal, civil and administrative cases, the U.S. Marshals Service explained.

US Government’s BTC Auction

The U.S. government is auctioning off some bitcoins this month. According to the announcement by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) which is holding the auction, approximately 4,040.54069820 bitcoins will be for sale. The USMS is a federal law enforcement agency within the Department of Justice (DOJ). The agency explained that interested parties are invited to submit a bid for purchase, adding:

This sealed bid auction is for 4,040.54069820 bitcoin … The required deposit to participate in this auction is $200,000.00 USD.

The auction is divided into four series. Series A consists of five blocks of 500 BTC per block, Series B has 10 blocks of 100 BTC each, Series C has 10 blocks of 50 BTC each, and Series D has one block of 40.54069820 BTC. Bidders cannot view other bids and cannot change their bids once submitted. At the current rate, the BTC up for auction is worth more than $37,436,660.

How to Participate in the US Government’s Auction

To be eligible to bid in the auction, interested bidders must register with the USMS and submit all required documents with deposits. Registration opened on Feb. 3 and will close on Feb. 12. The winning bidder’s deposit will be retained by the USMS and credited towards the purchase price. The deposits of other bidders will be returned to the original accounts from which they were received.

The online auction will take place on Feb. 18 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. EST. Bids must be an all-cash offer in U.S. dollars. The announcement details:

The USMS will endeavor to notify the winning bidder(s) by 5:00 PM EST on Tuesday, February 18, 2020.

However, the government agency warned that “the number of bids received and the complexity of the review process may require additional review time.” The winning bidder must wire purchase funds to the agency by 2:00 p.m. EST on Wednesday, Feb. 19. Failing to do so will disqualify the bidder and another winning bidder will be selected.

Seized BTC From Various Cases

The USMS also explained on its website where these digital assets came from, stating:

These bitcoins were forfeited in various federal criminal, civil and administrative cases.

These cases involved the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Customs and Border Protection (USCBP). Some of them were named, such as the U.S. v. Tyler Lee Ward (Case No. 18-cr-438), U.S. v. Ryan Farace (Case No. 18-cr-00018), U.S. v. Matthew Lee Yensan (Case No. 17-cr-00303), U.S. v. Alexandre Cazes (Case No. 17-cv-00967), and U.S. v. Ronald L. Wheeler, III (Case No. 17-cr-377).

The USMS is recognized as the U.S. government’s leader in the sale of cryptocurrency. It has conducted a number of digital asset auctions over the years, including one that disposed of the 144,000 bitcoins seized from the Silk Road darknet marketplace.

The first online government auction of seized bitcoins was held in 2014; the USMS sold 130,000 bitcoins valued at approximately $50 million at the time of the sales. In 2015, the agency conducted multiple online bitcoin auctions, selling nearly 174,000 BTC valued at approximately $67 million at the time.

The agency established a memorandum of understanding in 2016 with the Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture for it to handle the disposition of forfeited bitcoins emanating from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. In its annual report for the financial year 2018, the agency declared that it sold a total of 5,883 bitcoins in two auctions for a total of $55.8 million, adding that it continued to be the lead custodian for the 22 different types of cryptocurrencies seized by the DOJ and the Department of Treasury.

The BSV network upgraded at approximately 02:00 UTC Tuesday, implementing Genesis rules that bring about “the full restoration of Satoshis Bitcoin protocol.” Jimmy Nguyen, president of the Bitcoin Association and bitcoin SV advocate, tweeted, adding the “historic moment” had been confirmed at block 620539.

By rolling out the original bitcoin protocol first released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, the Genesis fork removes the default hard cap for block sizes, reportedly removing limits for transaction capacity and increasing on-chain scalability.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Doing away with the hard cap allows businesses to build “large-scale applications” on BSV, the project said Tuesday. A change in the bitcoin scripting language, they add, will enable the protocol to perform functions – like smart contracts – and potentially allow the project to compete with blockchain projects such as ethereum.

Genesis is designed to be the last significant update on the BSV blockchain; the implementation has been “locked-in irrevocably,” according to an on-chain message in the first post-fork transaction from the BSV developer team. An unchanging base protocol saves developers and companies from having to undergo frequent technical changes, the team says.

'Inadvertent' split

BitMEX Research tweeted there were still “a significant number of nodes [that] have not upgraded for the hardfork and are stuck on the pre-hardfork block,” an hour or so after the Genesis implementation.

Initially there appeared to be no signs of a chain split – where a blockchain splinters into multiple active versions – but BitMEX research reported just a few hours later the pre-Genesis chain had been “extended by one block.”

A BSV spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk the split had been caused by one miner – “which in the scheme of things is very good” – the Bitcoin Association was trying to contact.

Nguyen said this was not a “persistent chain split” but what appeared to be a miner “who did not update their software to Genesis.” None of the mining pools so far contacted by the association had been responsible for the “inadvertent block,” he added.

“A single block inadvertently mined on the wrong chain will not be extended – just the way Nakamoto consensus is supposed to work as described in the Bitcoin white paper. Nodes consider the longest chain as valid and extend that branch,” Nguyen said.

BSV has been at the center of controversy since it forked from bitcoin cash in November 2018. One of its main proponents, Craig Wright, has claimed to be bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto since 2016; many industry figures have disagreed with his claims, however.

Further, the cryptocurrency’s proponents commonly hold the belief that BSV is the true bitcoin.

“Bitcoin can finally be Bitcoin again and the miners can continue to write the Chronicle of everything,” stated the on-chain post-fork message.

Emotions still run high on this issue. For instance, after announcing Monday that Twitter added a bitcoin emoji to its platform, billionaire and BSV advocate Calvin Ayre tweeted founder Jack Dorsey he is backing the “wrong side.”","Source: Mode

London-based fintech firm Mode, advised and backed by Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, has launched its Bitcoin banking mobile iOS app.

This will make Bitcoin - the world’s most popular digital asset which many refer to as ‘digital gold’ - accessible to everyone at the touch of a button.



The platform is available to users globally, except in the United States of America.



A Mode account can be opened in less than 60 seconds, with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements completed in less than two minutes through AI-enabled identity verification technology. Once users are whitelisted, depositing GBP via bank transfer and buying Bitcoin takes seconds.



Mode’s launch is supported by new research (1) which reveals that many current and potential Bitcoin investors are unhappy with the platforms and services currently on offer. Findings (2) also reveal the potential for strong Bitcoin market growth, as 42% of people who currently own Bitcoin plan to buy more, 51% of people surveyed indicated they may buy Bitcoin soon, and just a small fraction of respondents, around 7%, said they have no intention of currently buying the digital asset.



Through its new easy to use app, Mode aims to bring down the barriers and open up the Bitcoin market to everyone, not just tech-savvy or professional investors. As a result, users can get started with only £50, and unlike many other apps, Mode only charge a very competitive fee of 0.99% at the time of purchasing and selling Bitcoin. Mode doesn’t charge for transferring GBP in and out of users’ accounts, and funds are credit almost instantly via Faster Payments - a process that can take up to 5 days with some of the most renown crypto exchanges.



Users can buy Bitcoin with bank cards or via a bank transfer, which is then safeguarded through one of the world’s leading digital asset custodians, BitGo.



In addition to its new app, Mode has also announced plans to launch a Bitcoin interest-generating product later this year, which would allow users to earn passive income on their Bitcoin holdings without having to touch their assets.



Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter, joined Mode as an advisor of the project. He has also invested in Mode and acts as a non-executive director of R8, Mode’s parent company.



“Although there are multiple existing ways to access the Bitcoin market right now, few appeal to the everyday person, who wants to buy and hold some Bitcoin. Most of the current apps all have one problem at their core—access.” Biz Stone commented; “Mode has removed needlessly complex processes from their app, building a beautiful and responsive UI and UX rivalling that of the major challenger banks—while also launching a completely new and innovative Bitcoin product.”



Ariane Murphy, Head of Communications and Marketing, Mode, said: “Our new app not only enables us to capture the huge growth in the Bitcoin marketplace, but also tackles many of the issues people have with the current platforms and storage services available, which our research shows are significant. The Mode app addresses transaction restrictions issues, low speed/high cost, lack of security and most importantly, tackles the poor user experience typically associated with Bitcoin apps.”



“Until the beginning of this year, we pilot-tested our app with some 1,000 early subscribers and their feedback has been very positive. This, coupled with the strong growth in the marketplace, means we are confident that now is the right time to launch to the wider public.”



Challenges to tackle in the digital asset markets - new research

Mode recently conducted research (1) with people who already own digital assets, revealing that 41% of respondents described the process of transacting Bitcoin through existing solutions as average or poor, with just 13% describing the process as excellent.



Some 37% say the level of security offered by the platforms they have used is again average or poor, with 41% claiming security is good and 21% excellent - signifying some room for improvement.



In terms of overall user experience, just 56% describe other digital asset services as good or excellent, with 32% saying it is average and 11% describing their experience as poor.



Mode is part of R8 Group, a UK fintech group which raised $5m in a heavily oversubscribed funding round in April 2019, backed by an experienced management team with extensive experience in the financial services and technology sectors. Prominent members of the R8 Group include serial entrepreneur Jonathan Rowland, and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone.","Bitcoin.Com Releases Fastest Ever Wallet App, With Built-In Support for Bitcoin Cash-Powered Tokens

Bitcoin.com has developed its fastest ever wallet app with an improved design and a new focus on user experience. The Bitcoin.com Wallet also now offers full support for SLP tokens, opening a whole new universe of digital assets for millions of users around the globe.

New Lightning-Fast Crypto Wallet App

A new Bitcoin.com Wallet app has begun rolling out to iOS and Android mobile users, bringing millions of people the fastest client ever. Among the new updates included in the mobile app focused on speed is Instant Pay, a feature which completes bitcoin cash payments in less than a second, making it faster than traditional payment methods and other existing wallets. It delivers a seamless payment experience through the app, allowing users to complete transactions instantly at online and physical retailers that accept bitcoin cash.

To use this new feature, you simply need to set up a spending threshold in the app before performing a transaction and then the BCH payment can be completed instantly once the recipient’s QR code has been scanned. The increased speed should result in more customers choosing BCH as their preferred choice of payment.

“Censorship-resistant peer-to-peer cash is now lightning fast through our wallet app. Instant Pay, an all-new wallet feature which is exclusive to Bitcoin Cash, lets you make payments in a split second,” stated Stefan Rust, CEO of Bitcoin.com. “These payments outpace Visa and Mastercard, making our wallet app faster than any other.”

In addition to speed, the new wallet app feature other new and improved functions including letting users manage BCH and BTC in one secure integrated platform, as well as allowing them to purchase BCH and BTC using a credit card. The app also focuses on personal customization, letting users tweak their accounts to their liking with new options. The developers have even introduced a personal notes mechanism, which allows users to append data to individual transactions.

On the privacy and security side, fingerprint identification and facial recognition are also now available to ensure that only the owner can access the account. And customizable transaction speed settings have been introduced, which can be used to delay payment confirmation. The app also features a Discover section – a new maps interface that allows users to locate nearby merchants that accept bitcoin cash for payments, ensuring you can always find a place to spend BCH and encouraging more businesses to adopt the cryptocurrency.

“The new design of the Bitcoin.com Wallet makes the entire experience easier for new users,” commented Corbin Fraser, the Head of Product at Bitcoin.com. “Our design team spent a lot of time considering how to create the most beautiful Bitcoin wallet available on the market today.”

Your Key to the SLP Token Ecosystem

Our development team has also been working around the clock to bring a completely re-imagined app experience that includes SLP tokens, so that the Bitcoin Cash powered tokens are now available in every wallet. With built-in token management support, users can send, receive, and store a variety of tokens that represent anything from dollar-pegged stablecoins to virtual gaming assets and company loyalty points, with the private keys held only by the user.

“With the addition of SLP token support, the Bitcoin.com Wallet app has become more than a place to store bitcoin,” added Fraser. “You can now manage thousands of diverse digital assets on the app alongside your cryptocurrency. Stay tuned for more game-changing features which are coming soon, too.”

Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) is an easy to use, robust and extensible token management system that allows anyone to create tokens on the Bitcoin Cash network in a permissionless way. It has helped the development of an ecosystem for BCH that replicates the variety of ERC20 tokens on the ETH network. SLP tokens can easily be created, traded, and managed on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain within seconds, while costing users only fractions of a penny for each transaction. All transactions are recorded onchain, and custom token behavior can be defined using a bitcoin Script developing language.

SLP token adoption has grown rapidly since being introduced in August 2018. This is in part thanks to Bitcoin.com Exchange which has started listing SLP tokens for trading on its platform. These include assets such as Gocrypto’s GOC, a token that enables merchants to accept crypto payments and receive settlement in their local fiat currency, as well as ACD, a token issued by the Tokyo-based ANA Holdings subsidiary Alliance Cargo Direct. Another recently released SLP token is Lead, an exclusive reward token you can earn by growing the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. SLP support has also been added by Cybavo, a cybersecurity firm providing private key management services to some of the biggest exchanges in the world. In total more than 6,000 tokens have been created using the SLP framework so far.

Last month, Bitcoin.com released the open source SLP Indexer Server for validating tokens and to make SLP transactions perform as fast as BCH, empowering developers to create even greater projects on the Bitcoin Cash network.

The Bitcoin.com Wallet app is free to download now for Android and iOS.

About $5 million of XRP and ADA was stolen. The hack was successful because the hacker gained access to users’ login credentials. What can be done to secure your account in the unlikely event that hackers get your login info?

Using Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication would be an option.

Google Authenticator is a helpful way of adding a level of security to your crypto exchange accounts. Google has a strong reputation for offering secure interactions with its suite of products, and the authenticator has become a staple of the security measures the internet giant offers customers.

Why You Should Set Up Google Authenticator to Secure Your Crypto Exchange Accounts

If you’re wondering how to use Google Authenticator, you may have some idea as to its value. Examining what it does to the process of a potential hacker may reveal even more benefits.

Many digital asset exchanges only have one level of security, the username and password. If a hacker has somehow gotten ahold of your login credentials for a crypto exchange account (via a phishing email for example), all they have to do is go to the exchange’s website, enter your details, and steal your coins.

Now, let’s see how Google Authenticator makes it so much harder for a hacker – even one with full access to usernames and passwords – to successfully access your account.

When you try to login, Google Authenticator essentially says, “That’s nice you know your username and password. Now, please prove that it’s really you.” This is done using one of your personal devices. The Google Authenticator app is installed on one or more of them, and a code is sent to the device via the app. Let’s say you have the app installed on your phone. When a hacker, armed with your crypto account login info, tries to get into your account, they are prompted to enter a code that is sent to your phone. They would have to have your phone, as well as the passcode to open it, in order to access your account.

Even if someone were to jack your SIM card and gain access to all of its data, you’re still protected with Google Authenticator because this two-factor authentication method doesn’t allow codes to be stored on your SIM card.

How to Set Up Google Authenticator

Download Google Authenticator on one or more devices. Using more than one device means you have a backup in case one of them is lost or stolen. You can find the app here for iPhone and here for Android devices. If you haven’t already, secure your device with a password. Create a Gmail account with another device. You need a gmail account to use Google Authenticator. If you already have one, you can use it. Log into your Google account and enable two-step authentication. You can go to https://www.google.com/landing/2step/. This will give you a QR code. You will use this to add devices. It would be a good idea to take a screenshot of the QR code and store it securely because then you can use it to add more devices later. You will also get backup codes that can be used to recover your account if the need arises. These should be stored as well. Scan the QR code with your devices that you will use with Google Authenticator. This produces an authentication code on each device. It’s a combination of six numbers, and it changes every 15 seconds. This is called your “token,” and you will use it to login to your crypto exchange account from now on. When figuring out how to use Google Authenticator, this is the most crucial step: the generation of the token. Entering these six numbers confirms that it’s really you. Enable two-factor authentication for every crypto exchange account for which you want to use it. The steps will be more or less the same for each account. You enable two-factor authentication, scan the QR code with your devices, put in the token and then log in to make sure everything’s working.

If you are an active trader with a substantial digital asset holding in your trading account(s), it is strongly advisable to use Google Authenticator as an additional security layer for your online accounts.

Crypto businesses are figuring out how to comply with the Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule,” where all crypto transactions above a certain amount must be accompanied by identifying information.

Competing visions for the technical implementation have emerged, though there appears to be general agreement on the need for messaging standards.

Legal and operational issues will be as challenging as putting technical solutions in place.

The FATF is set to kick the tires of a range of proposed tech solutions in June 2020.

Imagine SWIFT’s interbank messaging system but for crypto.

Hardcore blockchain libertarians would probably rather not. But firms that deal in cryptocurrency have been asked to abide by the so-called “Travel Rule,” and the clock is ticking.

Although it goes against the grain to shoehorn an identity layer onto a technology specifically designed to be pseudonymous, firms have no choice if they want to abide by the law. The shape and form this will take is something the industry must agree on, and fast.

In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog, updated its guidance to explicitly state that virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, must share sender (originator) and receiver (beneficiary) information in cryptocurrency transactions above a certain threshold.

With the one-year mark fast approaching, the FATF will review progress on Travel Rule solutions at its June 2020 plenary meeting.

Meanwhile, U.S. regulator FinCEN issued its version of the regulation pertaining to VASPs in May 2019, stating that firms had 180 days to get their houses in order. This means the Travel Rule now carries the weight of law regarding U.S.-based VASPs. (VASPs are businesses that conduct the exchange, transfer or safekeeping of virtual assets, as well as activities relating to issuing or underwriting virtual assets.)

There are differences of opinion over the best technical solution, with some favoring a blockchain-based approach and others not. Equally challenging are the operational and legal hurdles crypto exchanges face in rolling out a compliant system en masse.

To DLT or not to DLT?

There are two parts to the problem. First, there needs to be some means of identifying VASPs. This could be broadly equivalent to the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) used by SWIFT or something like the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) system.

The second part of the problem concerns data transmission. The ideal solution crypto businesses and industry groups are working towards would be a standards-based and interoperable message layer between VASPs, allowing identity, authentication and messaging to be pinned onto blockchain transactions.

There are some 20-plus solutions being built to tackle the problem. Some are relatively small-scale commercial endeavors, while others involve groups of participating firms and behave more like open protocols.

Some of the offerings mentioned in the working group arena include Bitcoin Suisse’s OpenVASP, CipherTrace’s TRISA, Sygna Bridge, Netki, Shyft and KYC Chain. Dedicated crypto-sleuthing firms including Elliptic, Coinfirm and Chainalysis have all been working on this as well. Indeed, Chainalysis recently hired former FinCEN staffer Mike Mosier to help build Travel Rule capabilities.

There are proposals that favor a more traditional battle-tested approach – such as having a centralized global registry of VASP addresses as a necessary trust anchor – and then there are the solutions taking a more decentralized approach, involving blockchains or DLT.

“The assumption that blockchain must have the solution to something that is a blockchain problem may not necessarily be true – as desirable as that may be for folks at an aspirational level, philosophically,” said Siân Jones, senior partner at XReg Consulting and convener of the Joint Working Group for InterVASP Messaging Standards (JWG-IVMS).

Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at trade group Global Digital Finance said his view (and the view of some regulators) is there needs to be more than one tech provider.

“So it might be that Coinbase chooses Tech Provider A; Binance uses Provider B,” he said. “So we end up with a matrix, with smaller exchanges copying the larger ones they want to work with.”

Turning to ethereum

Switzerland’s OpenVASP project is what you might expect from a country that’s relatively advanced when it comes to meeting FATF recommendations, and has even gone beyond them in some respects.

The project is helmed by Bitcoin Suisse and also includes Lykke exchange and crypto banks Seba and Sygnum. The Swiss have taken a practical approach, building a solution the industry can start using as quickly as possible.

A key design principle for OpenVASP is decentralization, which means avoiding the mistakes of the past, say its developers, like having a single point of failure, central servers and directories. In order to achieve decentralization where it’s deemed desirable, OpenVASP is leveraging a selection of features from ethereum.

For instance, at its messaging layer, OpenVASP proposes using Whisper, ethereum’s off-chain peer-to-peer messaging system. (To be clear, the OpenVASP white paper points out other messaging systems can be used.)

Whisper employs so-called dark routing to obscure message content and sender and receiver details to observers, a bit like anonymous web browsing using Tor, making it a neat way to meet privacy requirements.

“This means that nobody would be able to understand that two VASPs are interacting with each other,” said David Riegelnig, head of risk management at Bitcoin Suisse. “With respect to competitiveness, it should be nobody’s business to know which VASPs interact, as long as the VASPs comply with their Travel Rule requirements and can do their sanctions checks screening and so forth.”

Who’s in charge?

The addressing and authentication parts of the OpenVASP solution use ethereum’s decentralized public key infrastructure, meaning the VASP must deploy a smart contract that represents identity on the blockchain. Using smart contracts on ethereum creates a blockchain public key directory for the VASP and an IBAN-like numbering format: the virtual asset account number (VAAN).

“The alternative could be a global directory of VASPs with their public keys, which sounds very simple,” said Riegelnig. “But then you have to ask, ‘In which country is this server going to stand? In which jurisdiction? Who controls it?’ And so on.”

Obviously there are going to be people who are concerned that OpenVASP is tied to ethereum, Riegelnig said. “They think it’s everything on the blockchain. But the only thing we actually use on ethereum is the smart contract where you store the public key,” he said. “Then these concerns tend to get much smaller.”

OpenVASP said it is in talks with all the big exchanges and named Binance, Kraken and Bitstamp as three that are looking at its solution. Having read the other white papers, Riegelnig said that, with the possible exception of very centralized commercial projects, they all involve some intangible parts that are basically high-level ideas.

Riegelnig said OpenVASP was “on the same page” as CipherTrace when it comes to exchanging end-to-end encrypted messages and not having a persistent blockchain data layer. But elsewhere there are shortcomings, he said.

“They [CipherTrace] somehow still rely on blockchain addresses as the identifier between VASPs. That is not very practical because public blockchain addresses change all the time,” said Riegelnig. “When you have a client and you want to transfer crypto to other VASPs, it’s much easier if you can refer to this client or their account by a client number, instead of an ever-changing blockchain address number.”

Disagreements

CipherTrace’s TRISA uses public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authorities. A “know-your-VASP” certificate would be sent from the exchange originating a transaction to the one receiving it. These certificates would be verified through a trusted third-party certificate authority.

CipherTrace Chief Financial Analyst John Jefferies pointed out that while a certificate authority might be controlled by a central entity, there are typically multiple distributed instances and therefore does not constitute a single point of failure.

“By avoiding global directories, OpenVASP is also avoiding known good security, and betting the whole thing on the ethereum blockchain,” said Jefferies.

“The thing about public key is that there are a lot of service providers and there can be numerous competing service providers. So while it’s not like the one grand VASP PKI in the sky, if one comes and another goes then people can change and they can adopt those certificates,” he said.

As far as interoperability is concerned, ethereum keys on OpenVASP can be supported by PKI, said Jefferies: PKI is extensible so the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. This speaks to a wider issue.

“Switzerland has some strict rules, but they don’t have a lot of interoperability with the U.S., and so I think the interoperability in this case is an important component,” Jefferies said.

‘SWIFT for crypto’

While firms duke it out for the best technical solution, agreeing on a standard format to handle the message payloads will simplify things, at least on one level.

“The timeline could be dramatically reduced and the costs minimized if there was an open standard, like ISO or IEEE standards,” said Jones of the InterVASP group. This would be a common universal language for the transfer of data, regardless of any national legislation, and regardless of which technological solution the VASP plugs into, she said.

The InterVASP group has been joined by a coalition of trade bodies including Global Digital Finance, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and the International Digital Asset Exchange Association (IDAXA). The goal of the InterVASP group is to have a standard in place and ready for adoption by May 8, during New York Blockchain Week.

Standardizing the underlying messaging packet is a good path to follow, said Wright of Global Digital Finance. In situations like this, something as simple as date of birth, for example, might cause problems, Wright said. DOBs could be in U.K. format, U.S. format or long-form actual format.

“If every provider chose its own format, the cost of actually deciphering it on receipt and then making sure you have accurately transposed it is quite significant,” he said. “So having even the simplest of things like that in a format that makes sense goes a long way to standardize the industry.”

Wright acknowledged the stigma around the idea of a “SWIFT for crypto,” which instantly raises hackles. “If you’ve got the same order of fields and the same name of fields, and you know how to deal with transliteration and so forth, all agreed by the industry, then that part of SWIFT, in essence, is a reasonable thing,” he said.

Call the lawyers

Exchanging personal data between VASPs in different parts of the world could require detailed legal frameworks in order to not run afoul of regulations like GDPR, said Coinfirm CEO Pawel Kuskowski.

For this reason, Coinfirm, which has also formed a working group and claims to have government backing for that endeavor, has pulled in Gibraltar-based crypto lawyer Joey Garcia, partner at ISOLAS LLP, and London-based Dean Armstrong QC, head of chambers at the 36 Group.

Coinfirm is using a high-throughput permissioned blockchain for writing the “fingerprint” of a compliant transaction, built on the enterprise-grade DLT Hyperledger Fabric. The latter employs a private channel architecture, which has been compared to private message channels on Slack.

“There are two parts to consider when you are talking about the Travel Rule,” Kuskowski said. “One is part is technological and the other is regulatory. Really anyone who is touching this has to have someone from the legal space.”

Jefferies of CipherTrace said solving the technical challenge is not any greater than the operational hurdle, or “sunrise problem” of switching on the system for 500 VASPs at once.

As G20 countries gradually begin to roll this out, increased jurisdictional arbitrage seems likely, he added.","Despite markets are going down, XRP price remains stable. BitMEX has added USDXRP perpetual swaps to attract sophisticated users to its platform.

BitMEX is the largest exchange offering cryptocurrency derivatives, according to some outlets. Users will get one more trading opportunity on 5 February 2020, 04:00 OTC. The XRP swaps will be available, with the coins traded against USD with up to 50x leverage. It is said in the BitMEX announcement from 4 February 2020.

Per the announce:

“Symbol: XRPUSD Expiry Date: Perpetual

Bitcoin Multiplier: 0.0002 XBT (20,000 Satoshis)

XBT Contract Value: XRPUSD Price * Bitcoin Multiplier (20,000 Sat/$1)

Underlying: .BXRP

Max Leverage: 50x

Funding Min/Max: -0.75% to 0.75%

Session Interval: 8 hours”

Artur Hayes, the BitMEX CEO, is famous for his sense of humor. This time, he sparkled the public by comparing XRP to ‘dog shit’ on Twitter. Some crypto experts think that the CEO is ‘unhappy’ with the addition of this asset. However, it is simply a friendly gesture sent towards XRP. It means “I know how some people call your coin, and I’m not like that”, with a reversion trolling to tackle BTC maxis and similar public.

As per the reason why the coin is added to the platform, it’s because it is worth ‘more than zero’. Yes, that’s simple! Per his Twitter:

Is it called Ripple, XRP, or dogshit? Who knows, who cares. It’s worth more than zero so it’s time to trade the USD pair on BitMEX. Boo-Yaka-sha! https://t.co/pa3T5vd5kl — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) February 4, 2020

In the comments under that tweet, people already start the war regarding BTC’s delusional domination. The user @ripcurldog notes that the XRP ecosystem already serving hundreds of banks around the world. At the same time, Bitcoin maximalists keep waiting for the institutional money to ‘make them rich’.

Could this become a trigger for the price increase? When the XRP to USDT trading was announced on Binance, the XRP price went up 10% in just one day. The current technical data show that the resistance is at $0.26, and the next one is $0.27. In case the price won’t go up, the possible support level is $0.23-0.24.

What the Hell is Perpetual Swap?

The perpetual swaps are futures contracts with the expiry date being left open. The traders have to pay some funding fees for the opening of such a swap contract. The contract is exchanging currency swaps among short and long users, this ensures convergence between the true price and perpetual one.

When the perpetual price becomes greater than the market price, a fee goes from shorts to longs. When the perpetual price goes down, the longs are paying the shorts. Traders open unexpected positions while keeping the perpetual price almost similar to the spot price.","The topic of payment channel networks is arcane but also required to speed up blockchain transactions. Bitcoin uses Lightning and Ethereum uses Raiden as payment channel networks. This article (the research paper is much clearer) describes a new solution from MIT and others that utilizes the concept of packet-switching networks, such as X.25, to speed up payment transactions:

“Payment Channel Network permits users to charge accounts with a selected amount of virtual currency and is used on layer two scaling solutions. Remittances are carried out on such accounts, and only the opening and closing of the account is listed on the blockchain.

This results in a mode of payment that is allegedly much faster and scalable as compared to that made on the blockchain.

The MIT Spider is attributed as an efficient one because members can invest as little as a section of funds in their account. MIT spider can also process four times more transactions as compared to other payment checking networks.

The report also mentioned that the scheme functions by dividing transactions in small packets that spread across different channels, dividing helps to route big payments through accounts with low funding levels. Due to this method, congestion is avoided according to its developing team. Vibhaalakshmi mentioned that the MIT Spider was inspired by packet switching, which is an effective way of carrying data over the web.”",

Crypto Prices See a Sharp Rise

Cryptocurrency proponents are pleased to see that prices are doing better than they were 24 hours ago. At press time, the entire cryptoconomy is worth around $266 billion and there’s billions worth of digital assets being swapped today. BTC is currently trading for $9,439 per coin and the market is up 3.4% on Wednesday. The currency has around $1.8 billion in global trade volume and the price is still 52% down from it’s all-time high (ATH) in December 2017.

The second-largest blockchain by market cap is ethereum (ETH) which is up 6% today and 11% for the week. Each ETH is swapping for $197 per coin and the asset is still down 86% from its ATH. Ethereum markets have around $962 million in reported trade volume during the last 24 hours. Ripple (XRP) still commands the third-largest market valuation and XRP is up 7% today at $0.27 per coin. The last seven days have seen XRP jump by 16% and the digital currency has around $1.3 billion in trade volume worldwide.

Bitcoin Cash Up 153% Since Jan. 1, 2019

Bitcoin cash (BCH) markets are up 14% over the last day and 11% for the last seven days. Each BCH is trading for $429 per coin and the currency’s global trade volume this Wednesday is around $1.1 billion. BCH is up 264% over the last 12 months and 153% since Jan. 1, 2019 when prices were at $168 per coin. At the time of publication, the BCH market cap is hovering around $7.85 billion. Cryptocurrency and Fxstreet analyst Ken Chigbo’s latest analysis says that “BCH/USD has an opportunity to shoot higher.” Chigbo notes that BCH/USD price action has continued to move “within a potential bullish pennant.” “The daily price action has been tight for going on seven sessions now, as the price consolidates,” the analyst remarked. “A range block formation is observed via the 60-minute chart view, awaiting the next committed move potentially from the bulls.”

Perma Bull Tom Lee Predicts BTC Market Prices Could Tap New Highs

Fundstrat Global Advisors cofounder Tom Lee is well known for his price predictions and many people consider his opinions to be extremely bullish. On Feb. 4, Lee told the press that he is “really optimistic” about BTC prices in the short term and has made another prediction. “January is usually a week month, it was a great month for bitcoin, [which is] up 26% — but also recovered its 200-day moving average,” Lee told Yahoo Finance. “That’s a big deal as you know, as anyone [who follows trends] knows when you’re back above your 200-day, you’re back in a bull market. Whenever bitcoin breaks back into its 200-day, its average six-month gain is 197%,” the Fundstrat executive said.

Wealth Manager Expects BTC Prices to Jump to $400k by 2030

On a Citizen Bitcoin podcast hosted by Brady Swenson, a California-based investment advisor from the firm Wescap said that he believes hyperbitcoinization will happen. “I think the total valuation on 10 years that I use is about $8 trillion and that comes from various buckets,” said Andy Edstrom. “Whether it’s taking share from gold, or taking share from fiat, or taking share from offshore assets, or slightly demonetizing other stores of value like real estate or new uses that we haven’t thought of, or are still under construction, such as micropayments,” explained Wescap’s Edstrom. The wealth manager noted that severe geopolitical tensions and the mass printing of fiat reserves could push more people toward BTC. Edstrom has written a book called “Why Buy Bitcoin,” and the investment advisor discusses the examination with Swenson throughout the podcast episode.

‘BTC Prices Could Dump Hard,’ Says Popular Crypto Trader

The popular crypto trader on Twitter @MacnBTC, who has over 28,000 followers, warned on Feb. 2, 2020 that “BTC is gonna dump hard this week and over $100M in longs will get wiped.” The trader pinned the tweet to his profile and said “don’t say I didn’t warn you” as well.

$BTC is gonna dump hard this week and over $100M in longs will get wiped. Don't say I didn't warn you — Mac ❄️🐺 (@MacnBTC) February 2, 2020

Despite all the people telling Mac that the price won’t dump, he continues to tweet that it’s still happening. “I hope it will happen,” the Twitter account Gemhunter replied. “Made great profits, after passing 9.6k I’m tethering and making some serious sat game,” he added. Another person disagreed with Mac’s tweet on Wednesday and said: “Dream on — No pullbacks in a bull market.”

In addition to the top 10 currencies seeing some price action on Wednesday, a slew of lesser-known coins has seen some considerable gains and losses. Cryptaur is up 467% today, fusion gained 396%, lisk jumped 72%, and mossland gained around 28% in the last 24 hours. As far as 24 hour losses are concerned, loom network coins are down 34%, karatgold coin has lost 24%, gifto is down 14%, and the icon project has seen a loss of 6% during the last day.

The US Secret Service arrested John Michael Caruso on Jan. 30. Caruso is the founder of Zima Digital Assets, a blockchain and cryptocurrency investment firm, and has dubbed himself the “Michael Jordan of algorithmic cryptocurrency trading.” Authorities arrested Zachary Salter, an aspiring R&B singer who co-founded Zima with Caruso, the same day.

Investigators said that “numerous victims” caught in the elaborate scam were former Major League Baseball players and their families. The players themselves are not identified in court documents. Other victims are described as senior citizens, such as the 76-year-old who gave the two men $200,000 to invest in cryptocurrency and an 86-year-old who entrusted them with $60,000.

The government believes the $7.5 million is just a portion of their total haul, and that the pair may have stashed additional ill-gotten proceeds “in an unknown location.”

Authorities say that Caruso, who declared income of just $22,800 in 2018, was able to convince the public that Zima was skillfully playing the crypto market and generating big returns.

“I’m not in the business of guessing, I make calculated trades using tested principles and algorithms since trading is using historical models to predict the future,” Caruso said last year.

Zima’s website says the firm “operates various private funds focusing on investments in cutting-edge technologies, including crypto and other blockchain based assets.” It also claims that Caruso and Salter have been “investing in long and short cryptocurrency and blockchain technology strategies since 2012.”

None of that is true, contend prosecutors.

The “pattern of investor payments against investor payouts with no investment of funds is consistent with…a Ponzi scheme,” court filings say. There is “no evidence any of the investment funds…have gone to any cryptocurrency/digital asset investment, or to any investment of any kind.”

The investigation began after the Federal Trade Commission received an anonymous complaint about Zima in April 2019.

Most of the money Caruso and Salter took from their customers went not into investments but toward funding their opulent lifestyles, prosecutors say. They each lived in mansions valued at about $9 million. Caruso is the registered owner of a 2019 Lamborghini Urus, and over the last two years spent at least $350,000 to rent, among other luxury vehicles, a Rolls Royce, a Ferrari, and an Aston Martin. Caruso, who also flew to London, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Hawaii, Cabo San Lucas and Aruba aboard private jets over the past two years, and has taken about 30 trips to Las Vegas, where he lost more than $1.4 million gambling in a 13-month period.

Salter, meanwhile, describes himself as “a serial entrepreneur” who has interests in the aviation and automotive industries.

“I’ve known since I was young that I wanted to make a positive impact,” he said in a Q&A with Entrepreneur magazine last June. “My mantra is ‘Gold Intentions,’ which I got as a tattoo when I dropped out of college at 20 years old.”

Salter, who reported no income at all in 2018, lived just as lavishly as Caruso. He owns two Mercedes, a BMW, an Audi, and a 1957 Chevy, which he flaunted online. Court documents point to Instagram posts as evidence of their lifestyle.

“Some other relevant Instagram photos include a posting dated August 1, 2018, in which a woman posted a photograph with her posing next to a newer model white BMW sedan with a red gift bow on it thanking her boyfriend, Salter, for surprising her with a new car,” the complaint says. “On May 12, 2019, Salter posted on Instagram that he purchased a new car for his mother on Mother’s Day with a photo of her standing near a newer model Mercedes. Also posted on Instagram was a video in which Salter is laughing with Caruso about Caruso damaging ‘another one’ of his Ferraris with the video focused on the scraped rear bumper of a Ferrari.”

Authorities had Caruso and Salter under both physical and electronic surveillance.

Caruso has spent time in jail before. He was found guilty of threatening to cut off a man’s hands and genitals in a $200,000 extortion scheme he carried out with his father in 2009. Caruso received five years probation for that crime, but was sentenced to three years in prison for violating the terms of his probation on three separate occasions. He was released in 2017, after serving 20 months, and set up the Zima website shortly after getting out.

Authorities wrote in the court documents that Caruso “appears to have wholeheartedly embraced his background and chartered the career trajectory of a full-time, career criminal…He appears to believe that he is endowed with superior intelligence, and indeed, details of his activities in jail where he engaged in a complex coordination of people and resources provided glimpses of a criminal mastermind at work.”

Prosecutors argued that Caruso be detained pending trial, calling him a flight risk. He “has spent his entire adult life attempting to defraud people,” the government said in a motion filed with the court. “He has already utilized at least half a dozen criminal schemes. His relationship with the truth is tenuous at best.”

Salter, who does not have a prior criminal history, was released to his father’s custody. Lawyers for Caruso and Salter did not respond to a request for comment.","Malta-based Binance, one of the world’s top cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, now allows users put up their crypto holdings as collateral to fund futures trading.

Launched soon before press time, the new “Cross Collateral” feature means users can trade futures contracts using assets stored in their Binance exchange wallet as collateral, without the need to use their coins to directly fund orders.

Traders using the service can currently borrow tether (USDT) at zero percent interest against holdings of Binance USD (BUSD) – the exchange’s own stablecoin issued in partnership with New York-regulated firm Paxos – thereby eliminating the need to transfer BUSD to a futures wallet.

Aaron Gong, director of Binance Futures, said users of the exchange can expect additional tokens to be supported in the “near future.”

“Cross Collateral is a much-anticipated feature for traders on Binance, allowing more flexibility and more choices of deposits to open futures positions,” said Gong.

The Binance Futures platform gives users the opportunity to trade 13 pairs with high leverage, and also to hedge existing positions to manage their risk. To date, users can trade BTC contracts with a leverage of up to 125x, the highest among major crypto exchanges.","Altcoins like Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum are ripping today as buying seems to widen in the cryptocurrency space.

Ethereum (ETHUSD) is up more than 5 percent in the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin Cash (BCHUSD) has advanced 11 percent. ETHUSD is the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency, accounting for almost 8 percent of the market. BCHUSD ranks No. 4 at less than 3 percent.

So-called altcoins, or alternatives to the original Bitcoin (BTCUSD), have outperformed since mid-January. That marks a change in sentiment from the previous two years, when they lagged BTCUSD by a wide margin.

24-hour price changes for select cryptocurrencies. Notice altcoins strength.

It could be positive for cryptocurrencies because altcoins rose more than BTCUSD during the last bull market of 2016 and 2017. It’s similar to breadth in the stock market, when investors widen their buying into smaller companies as prices advance.

No single news event seems to explain the strength in altcoins, although attention seems to be returning to cryptos. Earlier this week, for instance, CNBC reported that BTCUSD had its best January in seven years.

Here Comes Halving

Google Trends also shows interest in the term “halving” has doubled since late November. Halving is technical change in BTCUSD that will slow the supply of new tokens. Expected on May 12, this process has previously had a positive impact on prices.

In conclusion, cryptocurrencies continue to recover from their big drops in 2018 and 2019. Strength in altcoins today suggests the process may be widening.

Crypto exchange service provider Bitspark is shutting down next month despite reporting exponential growth following the launch of its cash point product. The CEO of the company explained that its internal restructuring has not worked out but insisted that the ongoing protests in Hong Kong and coronavirus outbreak have not affected his platform much.

Bitspark Closing Shop After 5 Years

Hong Kong-based crypto exchange and remittance service provider Bitspark announced on Tuesday that it is shutting down on March 4. CEO George Harrap explained:

This decision was not taken lightly, particularly due to the excellent performance we have seen since the release of our Cash Point product late last year which has seen 400% MoM growth.

There will be limited services between now and the end of March 4. The CEO added that customers can contact the company directly and request a withdrawal “if their Bitspark account or DEX wallet (with sparkdex assets) still has a balance.” He clarified, “Liquidity will remain on the Bitspark markets until 4 March and the final ZEPH buyback will be an order on the order books as of today.” After March 4, account logins will be disabled for a period of 90 days.

Company Says Business Was Going Well

Prior to this shutdown announcement, Bitspark had been working on launching several projects. On Dec. 27, the company highlighted in a year-in-review post that it had 144 trading pairs in 12 currencies and had issued stablecoins in HKD and PHP. In addition, it claimed to have had a steady stream of inbound customers from over 30 countries. “Next year, as we integrate with ERC20, Bitspark will be the primary provider of cash-to-crypto services for everything related to the Ethereum network, including hard wallets like Trezor and the global DeFi movement,” Bitspark wrote.

Harrap noted that his company was “the first company to ever do end to end remittances via bitcoin in 2014,” adding that it was also “the first exchange in Asia with 20+ tokens (2014), the first [with] stablecoins for exotic currencies, first exchange in Asia with insurance coverage (Bitgo) and the only cash-based fiat on/off ramp in crypto.”

Founded in Hong Kong in 2014, the company operates a web-based platform for sending and receiving payments using cryptocurrency. “We were the first in the world to send a cash-in, cash-out bitcoin transfer between Hong Kong and the Philippines – it was the first use case the industry saw of crypto being used for utility above all else,” its website details.

Coronavirus and Protests Not to Blame

In his Tuesday announcement, the CEO divulged the reason for shutting down. He wrote, “Unfortunately due to internal restructuring that hasn’t worked out, and a decision taken by shareholders internally, we have made the decision to close our doors.” He elaborated:

While the HK protests and now virus epidemic haven’t affected us much, it hasn’t helped either.

Businesses in Hong Kong have been suffering from a number of factors, weighing down on the region’s economy. Not only are there ongoing protests, but there is now also the coronavirus scare that has driven many investors out of the area. The number of coronavirus cases has grown to 24,536 worldwide, with 492 deaths reported as of Wednesday.

Last week, the South China Morning Post reported that banks in Hong Kong are closing up to 30% of branches as a public safety measure. For example, Bank of China will close 49 branches, Bank of East Asia 20, HSBC 20 premier and four business centers, and Hang Seng 18 branches and 10 MTR outlets. Flights to Hong Kong are also being suspended. American Airlines and United Airlines, for example, announced on Tuesday that they are suspending flights from the U.S. to Hong Kong until Feb. 20 due to a drop in demand as the coronavirus spreads.

Bitcoin bulls pushed prices to fresh three-month highs above $9,700, reinstating the bull view aborted by a doji candle earlier this week.

The indicators on the daily and weekly charts are signaling strong bullish momentum.

Bitcoin could test the psychological resistance of $10,000 in the near term. Pullbacks, if any, could be short-lived.

While bitcoin’s rally has gathered pace in the last 24 hours, other major cryptocurrencies have put on a better show.

Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, found bids near $9,100 during the Asian trading hours on Wednesday and rose to a fresh three-month high of $9,755 during the late U.S. session.

The convincing break above $9,600, a level from which bitcoin turn lower earlier this week, has revived the immediate bullish view aborted by Monday’s doji candle.

At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,615, representing a 4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

The crypto market leader, however, is outshone by other top 10 alternative cryptocurrencies (or “altcoins”), according to CoinMarketCap.

For instance, ethereum’s ether (ETH) is currently reporting a 9 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s offshoots bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) are flashing double-digit gains, and litecoin (LTC) and EOS are up at least 5 percent each. XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, is up just 0.75 percent.

Notably, ETH is trading well above $200 for the first time since September and has gained 63 percent so far this year. Other top coins such as LTC and EOS are reporting 78 percent gains on a year-to-date basis. By comparison, bitcoin is underperforming with a 34 percent gain.

Some lesser-known names including ontology (ONT), Qtum (QTUM), and waltonchain (WTC) have also risen more than bitcoin since the start of the year. As a result, bitcoin’s dominance rate – its share of the total crypto market value – has dropped to a seven-month low of 65 percent.

The Intermarket performance is suggestive of a bitcoin rally that is, in part at least, being fueled by increased demand for alternative cryptocurrencies.

Most of them are denominated in bitcoin. So investors tend to buy bitcoin first and then rotate the money into alternative coins, causing bitcoin’s price to rise relative to the dollar.

From a technical perspective, bitcoin’s rally looks to have legs and further gains could be in the offing. That could only bode well for broader markets.

Daily chart

Bitcoin jumped 5 percent on Wednesday, engulfing the price action observed in the preceding seven days and a sign bullish sentiment is quite strong.

Further, it closed (UTC) Wednesday above the lateral resistance of the Nov. 4 high of $9,586, establishing yet another bullish higher high.

Lastly, the cryptocurrency convincingly breached Monday’s high of $9,615, invalidating bull fatigue, signaled by that day’s doji candle.

All in all, the bulls look to have reinstated their dominance and could soon challenge the psychological resistance of $10,000.

Notably, there is no major resistance lined up between the current price and $10,000 that could cap upside. The 14-day relative strength index is still holding below 70, meaning the market isn’t overbought and there is room for further price gains.

Dips, if any, could see support at the ascending, or bullish, five- and 10-day averages currently placed at $9,412 and $9,396, respectively.

The overall bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above the higher low of $8,213 created on Jan. 24.

Weekly chart

Bitcoin witnessed a bearish channel breakout four weeks ago.

The MACD histogram is now beginning to print higher bars above the zero line – a sign of the strengthening bullish momentum. The RSI is also hovering in the bullish territory above 50 and pointing north.

Overall, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to the October high of $10,350.","In a Facebook post , Sun, founder of the Tron cryptocurrency platform, said he and several of his guests had an ""Amazing dinner w/ Warren Buffett finally!"" It included a photo of Buffett and Sun posing along with four other guests.

Cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun finally got his $4.6 million charity auction dinner with Warren Buffett last month.

Justin Sun had a charity dinner with Warren Buffett along with Sun's guests.

Sun also posted photos of gifts he presented to Buffett including one bitcoin , ""safely stored"" in a Samsung Galaxy Fold. ""Since I gifted him this #Bitcoin, $BTC has increased 16%! Hope it continues to moon!"" Sun wrote.

Sun added, ""Thx for your support & advice on how to take #TRON to the next level! Loved our talk on #Bitcoin , #Tesla & #TRON! Glad to support GLIDEsf as well! C U at # BRK2020 & our reunion meal in 2030!""

Buffett has been very vocal with his opinion that bitcoin is benefiting from an investment bubble and is not suitable for long-term investors. He does, however, see value in the underlying blockchain technology.

Along with the bitcoin, Sun also gave Buffett a bronze horse, ""since we are both born in Year of the Horse, 1930/1990!"" and a ""traditional Chinese paper cutting of mouse in celebration of the Year of the Mouse 2020.""

Sun posted a photo of the meal's receipt, saying ""Most delicious meal ever! Thks Warren Buffett for taking us to Happy Hollow Club! $4.56 MIL for a $515.05 dinner was money well spent! The insights I received are priceless."" The receipt is signed by Buffett and dated January 23.

CoinDesk reports Sun's guests included Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, eToro CEO Yoni Assia, Huobi CFO Chris Lee, and head of the Binance Charity Foundation, Helen Hai.

Sun's $4.5 million bid was the winner in the 2019 auction of a meal with Buffett.

A dinner had originally been scheduled for last July but was abruptly postponed when Sun said he was suffering from kidney stones. Around the same time there were stories in Chinese media that Sun was under investigation.

Sun later apologized for ""over-marketing"" the event ahead of time.","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Warren Buffett shared his views on Bitcoin, blockchain, and Tesla at lunch with Justin Sun. Buffett reportedly also received his first Bitcoin and Tron tokens in a gift from Sun.

The two enjoyed the meal at a private country club in Buffett’s home city, Omaha, Nebraska on Jan. 23. Sun had cancelled the lunch in July of last year, claiming unexpected kidney stones.

Accompanying Sun were guests including eToro CEO Yoni Assia, Head of Binance Charity Foundation Helen Hai, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, and Huobi CFO Chris Lee. “Thank you Warren Buffett for your dinner, wisdom, and vision. I’ll always remember sage advice on making TRON more successful,” said Sun.

In June 2019, Justin Sun won a charity auction with a record bid of $4.57 million. Buffett has been auctioning these dinners with himself every year since 2000, with the proceeds going toward charity.

Following Justin Sun’s cancellation, Chinese news outlets had reported he was under investigation by Chinese authorities. He later appeared via live cast in San Francisco, later apologizing for his “vulgar hype and marketing behavior” in a deleted letter.

At the meal, Sun gave Buffett his first Bitcoin. He also gifted the legendary investor a smartphone with 1,930,830 Tron tokens, representing his birthday, stored on it. The phone also included tokens for BitTorrent, WINK, and USDT-TRC20—projects on the Tron blockchain.

Warren Buffett still feels Bitcoin needs a lot of work to capture the value of blockchain, said Sun. Buffett called cryptocurrency a “mirage” in an interview with CNBC in 2018, “the idea it has some huge intrinsic value is a joke in my view.”

On Tesla, Buffett shared the following, according to Sun:

“Warren Buffett thinks Elon Musk is a great entrepreneur but he doesn’t think Tesla is a good investment, at the time, because the automobile industry has fierce competition and all of Tesla’s competitors have large cash reserves and won’t quit.”

However, Sun reported he may be warming on blockchain. “Warren Buffett believes there is great potential in blockchain and lots of his portfolio companies are exploring it, such as JP Morgan.”","Cryptocurrency investor Justin Sun finally dined with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) chief Warren Buffett, who's famously skeptical about Bitcoin. Berkshire Hathaway stock rose in buy range.

Last July, the 29-year-old Sun paid $4.57 million to have lunch with the investing legend as part of a charity fundraiser. But he put that meeting off, citing health and other issues.

Then on Jan. 23, Sun and four other crypto advocates met Buffett for a three-hour dinner that included steaks and Coca-Cola (KO) at the Happy Hollow Club in Omaha, Neb, Bloomberg reported Thursday.

Buffett, a notable critic of Bitcoin, has called it everything from ""rat poison squared"" to a ""delusion"" and ""gambling device.""

""Mr. Buffett shared a lot of his wisdom in business, investment and life in general,"" said a spokesman for Tron, cryptocurrency company founded by Sun, according to Bloomberg. ""And of course there were a lot of conversations around blockchain and crypto. ... Mr. Buffett said blockchain has its value. ... He believes blockchain technology will have a disruptive effect on the future of payment.""

While dubious about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Buffett is a fan of digital payment stocks. Buffett's widely followed investment portfolio has a massive stake in American Express (AXP) among its top 10 holdings. He also owns Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and Brazilian fintech stock StoneCo (STNE). He's also invested in Indian fintech company Paytm.

Visa and Mastercard initially supported Facebook's (FB) Libra global crypto-based payments network, but then backed out late last year.

Warren Buffett Responds

Buffett's assistant, Debbie Bosanek, told Bloomberg her boss and Sun had an ""interesting and enjoyable discussion"" at the dinner.

Other guests included Charlie Lee, founder of the Litecoin Foundation; Chris Lee, CFO of the Chinese exchange Huobi; Yoni Assia, CEO of the trading platform eToro; and Helen Hai, head of Binance Charity.

B-class shares of Berkshire Hathaway added 0.4% to 229.57 on the stock market today. Berkshire Hathaway stock cleared a three-weeks-tight 228.33 buy point early this year and is now finding support at the 10-week moving average, according to MarketSmith analysis. It's currently in buy range off a 226.40 entry, but the relative strength line is lagging.

But in an order this week, incorporating her reasoning from a Jan. 28 hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Chris McAliley said UnitedCorp’s lawyers at Akerman still have a long way to go to make a case. The judge dismissed the case without prejudice, giving the company until Feb. 28 to file an amended complaint but warning that she doesn’t yet see how the alleged scheme impeded competition.

UnitedCorp CEO Benoit Laliberte told me the company fully intends to accept Judge McAliley’s invitation to address her concerns. “This industry needs the U.S. justice system to start applying laws,” he said.

The company, represented by Akerman, claims that an international coalition - Chinese cryptocurrency mining hardware specialists, crypto software developers, a Tokyo-based Bitcoin investor and the operator of a well-known Bitcoin exchange – conspired to “hijack” the Bitcoin Cash network. UnitedCorp had invested heavily in 2017 in both hardware and software to run data centers mining for Bitcoin Cash. In 2018, the Bitcoin Cash network was scheduled for an upgrade. The crypto community referred to the upgrade as a “hard fork”: The protocols, or “node” that UnitedCorp (and many other miners) used were not compatible with another widely used node for mining Bitcoin Cash. Under the guiding principle of cryptocurrency and blockchain – which relies on the theory that decentralization prevents corruption of the market – data miners were to pick their preferred node for the network upgrade, allowing the community to decide the future of the network.

But according to UnitedCorp’s complaint, the defendants rigged the process. The company claimed that Bitcoin investor Roger Ver and his company Bitcoin.com “rented” Chinese servers to tilt the competition. The suit additionally alleged that cryptocurrency developers then set up “checkpoints” to lock in that preferred node, preventing other users from controlling the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, or virtual ledger, and averting future “hard fork” upgrades. To cap off the alleged scheme, the complaint said, the key Bitcoin exchange Kraken sided with Ver. The form of Bitcoin Cash that had been mined by UnitedCorp ended up being delisted from the Kraken exchange.

UnitedCorp claimed the purported scheme violated U.S. antitrust laws and a variety of Florida laws. The company also argued that the alleged conspiracy made a mockery of the crypto tenet of decentralization. “Making a centralized checkpoint that destroys the core principle of decentralized consensus was a significant and fundamental change to the blockchain,” the complaint said.

All of the defendants who were properly served with the complaint moved to dismiss the suit. I’ll home in on the motion filed by Bitcoin.com’s Ver, because his counsel Ian Simmons of O’Melveny & Myers took the lead for defendants at the Jan. 28 hearing before Judge McAliley. (O’Melveny also represents one of the developers that allegedly created a checkpoint to lock out UnitedCorp’s node. The Bitcoin exchange operator Kraken is represented by Kobre & Kim. The Chinese server defendants grouped under the name Bitmain have Jones Day.) Ver’s filing argued that UnitedCorp’s complaint is completely devoid of specific evidence that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy. There’s no assertion that they even communicated with one another about the “deeply implausible” scheme alleged by UnitedCorp, Ver said. The more plausible explanation for the success of the protocol they supported is that all of the entities named as defendants acted independently to assure the future of the Bitcoin Cash node they preferred. “This is what competition is about,” the brief said.

At the hearing before Judge McAliley, O’Melveny’s Simmons provided a metaphor for the Bitcoin Cash “hard fork.” He described a group of 100 pioneers trekking together until they come to a mountain. Twenty members of the group decide to try to dig their way through the mountain. The other 80 opt to go around. That’s what happened when Bitcoin Cash miners picked between the node favored by UnitedCorp and that preferred by Ver: They voted with their feet, and more picked to travel Ver’s route.

And according to Ver counsel Simmons, the ultimate evidence against UnitedCorp’s antitrust theory is that its Bitcoin Cash node is still operating. The currency isn’t listed on the Kraken exchange, but it’s still out there, Simmons said. “We now have more blockchains, more diversity in the marketplace than we had before,” he told the judge.

The O’Melveny lawyer specifically argued that UnitedCorp can’t show a per se violation of antitrust law because its allegations didn’t match case law on what constitutes overtly anticompetitive conduct, like price-fixing, market allocation or bid-rigging. UnitedCorp itself, he said, described its case as the first of its kind – the first attempt to police a cryptocurrency market for allegedly anticompetitive conduct. Almost by definition, Simmons said, a novel antitrust theory can’t be a per se violation.

Simmons said the complaint also failed to meet the criteria for showing an antitrust violation under the rule of reason. UnitedCorp, he said, didn’t plead a relevant product or geographic market, didn’t allege that the defendants controlled a relevant market and didn’t allege a restraint on competition. “They’ve alleged greater diversity in competition,” he said. “They’ve alleged more voice, rather than less voice. There’s not a diminution with the fork.”

UnitedCorp counsel Brian Miller of Akerman harkened back to Simmons’ pioneer analogy to explain why the alleged scheme was anticompetitive. What Simmons didn’t mention, he said, was that one group of pioneers – like Ver and his alleged co-conspirators – brought in a squad of Chinese workers to help them blast through the mountain, and then set up a roadblock on the other side to block the pioneers who traveled a different route. With those two steps, Miller said, Ver and the other defendants boxed out competitors like UnitedCorp.

At the end of the hearing, Judge McAliley told UnitedCorp’s lawyers that she “didn’t see how” they could plead a per se violation of federal antitrust law, in part because the industry is too young to provide context for the suit’s allegations and in part because they had not plausibly alleged that the defendants were acting in parallel. She also said she needed a better explanation of the relevant market and for why the rental of Chinese servers was anticompetitive. “I don’t think you have facts that plausibly establish harm to competition,” she said.

UnitedCorp CEO Laliberte said he and his lawyers are confident they can make their case in an amended complaint. He was encouraged, he said, by Judge McAliley’s thorough preparation for the hearing and deep interest in the case – which is just what cryptocurrency needs. “This is the future of money,” he said. “The decentralized environment is brilliant but you need laws … We need a chance for the court system to set some rules.”","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Bakkt is planning to purchase Bridge2 Solutions, a customer loyalty and rewards service, as part of its plans to offer a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-powered payment app in the near future.

The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) revealed details in a Feb 5. press release:

When Bridge2 Solutions ultimately joins Bakkt, the strategic combination will accelerate the development of the Bakkt consumer application, which will provide digital asset aggregation, conversion and payments through a single platform for consumers around the world.

This acquisition is part of Bakkt’s shift toward consumer services. Last year, it launched futures trading, derivatives products, and a custody service—all of which are aimed at institutional investors. By contrast, the upcoming payments app will be aimed at the general public.

More details should become clear in the next few months. Bakkt expects to launch its app within the first half of this year, and it plans to complete its acquisition of Bridge2 for an undisclosed amount by the end of this quarter.

Thousands of Connections

Previous announcements from Bakkt have focused almost exclusively on a partnership with Starbucks, which will allow its customers to spend their Bitcoin at the coffeehouse chain.

Bridge2, meanwhile, works with over 4500 loyalty, incentive, and employee perk programs. The company also powers the reward programs of seven leading financial institutions.

As such, Bridge2’s involvement means that Bakkt may offer a much wider range of possibilities.

Unfortunately, it does not seem that all of Bridge2’s connections will become involved with Bakkt immediately. ICE’s press release implies that brands will need to engage with Bakkt more directly.

“Integrating with Bakkt will allow top retail brands to offer more innovative loyalty programs and help consumers unlock and access value in those programs,” ICE explains.

Will Bakkt Win Over Consumers?

Bakkt’s upcoming payment app does not seem to be entirely unique. Plenty of crypto wallets and apps already support universal Bitcoin spending, including Square’s Cash app and Coinbase’s VISA card. Additionally, crypto payment apps such as Wirex and Crypto.com offer reward programs.

With that in mind, it is unclear whether the payment app will be attractive to the general public.

Bakkt’s major claim to fame is the fact that it is operated by ICE—which also operates the New York Stock Exchange and several other leading stock exchanges around the world. Those credentials may be relevant in the world of institutional investment, where cryptocurrency is a rare sight in any form.

However, those credentials may not be so noteworthy in the cryptocurrency payments industry, where Bakkt will need to compete with dozens of established services.","Ethereum’s next system-wide upgrade, Eth 2.0, won’t launch in Q2 2020 as expected, but researchers remain confident the initial network parameters will deploy in 2020. Anything less would be considered a “failure,” they said.

In an “Ask Me Anything” Reddit discussion held Wednesday, the Eth 2.0 team said the network won’t launch until three clients can run testnets consistently for a minimum of eight weeks. AMA participants included ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Eth 2.0 researchers Danny Ryan and Justin Drake.

“I have 95% confidence we will launch in 2020,” Drake wrote.

Eth 2.0, the next iteration of the world’s leading smart-contract blockchain, promises higher transaction throughput and a new security model under Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Often called Serenity, Eth 2.0 has been in the works since ethereum’s launch in 2015 but has been slow to get off the ground due to the highly technical nature of the endeavor.

The launch for Eth 2.0 was first slated for January 2020 and then an undisclosed date in Q2 2020. Developers are now eyeing the network’s fifth anniversary, July 30, 2020, for Eth 2.0’s debut. “Phase 0 will certainly launch in 2020. Audits are out and testnets are getting stronger every week,” Ryan said in the discussion thread. “I don’t see a reality in which Phase 0 does not launch in 2020.”

Ryan and Buterin said they believe Eth 2.0 could deploy Phase 0, the Beacon Chain, which acts as a general manager of Eth 2.0’s PoS system, on only two stable clients. Other Eth 2.0 researchers are opting for a more conservative approach, however.

At the time of ethereum’s debut in 2015, the Parity client launched after Geth, leading to the validator set swinging disproportionately toward the latter client, at an 80-20 tilt, Drake said. “Parity never managed to catch up with Geth,” he added.

Regardless of the launch date, Phase 0 and Phase 1 are 99 and 90 percent complete, respectively, Ryan said. Phase 1 will link ETH holders who have staked their assets to the Beacon Chain, joining the ribs to the backbone of the new network.

Third-party code audits and testnets – such as a lite client capable of being run on an Android smartphone demoed by Ethereum developer Nimbus on Tuesday – remain the outstanding tasks, Eth 2.0 researcher Diederik Loerakker said.

Spring cleaning

The coming months should also feature one major update for ethereum coin holders looking to participate in Eth 2.0’s launch: staking contracts.

As a PoS network, asset holders are rewarded for pledging their coin holdings to protect and validate the network. Eth 2.0 will require 32 ETH, currently valued around $6,400, to participate as a validator.

Contracts for staking ether (ETH) are under audit with an announcement expected this spring at a major ethereum event, Ryan said. The team said the number of validators could run into the millions with one researcher claiming up to 10 percent of ether’s supply, which has a current market cap of $23 billion, could be staked on Eth 2.0.

Finally, the Eth 2.0 team continues to examine how to package the current ethereum network, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network, into Eth 2.0.

Dubbed “Eth 1.5”, two options have been proposed: transitioning Eth 1.x into “stateless clients,” as detailed in a December blog post from Buterin, or merging Eth 1.x into the Eth 2.0’s Beacon Chain “as is.”

In short, the current ethereum blockchain can either be trimmed into digital receipts proving the authenticity of old PoW transactions or Eth 1.x can work within Eth 2.0 through interoperability bridges until the new chain is fully built out.","Blockstack is giving its long-term holders a new way to earn bitcoin.

Announced Thursday, the decentralized-web startup is rolling out a consensus mechanism that essentially presents a fresh use case for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency.

When version 2.0 of Blockstack’s Stacks blockchain comes out, miners on the network will need to post BTC to mine a block. That BTC will then get shared with nodes maintaining a copy of the ledger.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

“We accept bitcoin as the most secure blockchain in the world. We accept a world where this will continue to be the case,” Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk in a phone call.

The Stacks blockchain, which aims to put user data in the hands of users, is designed so apps can be built without central data storage. Apps can point to where to look for user data, and these pointers are stored on the Stacks blockchain. STX tokens are needed to participate in the chain.

To prevent spamming, or Sybil, attacks, all cryptocurrencies require some cost for writing new blocks. Bitcoin did this first by essentially requiring miners to spend electricity to participate, with its Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. By requiring miners to buy bitcoin and turn that over to the network to participate, Blockstack thinks it has found an ample cost to help prevent malicious entries.

How it works

Called Proof-of-Transfer (or PoX in the new Blockstack white paper describing the mechanism), the new consensus protocol has two kinds of participants: miners and stackers.

“PoX can help to solve a bootstrapping problem for new blockchains,” the white paper states. “Participation rewards in a separate, potentially more stable, base cryptocurrency can be a better incentive for encouraging initial participation than offering participation rewards in a new cryptocurrency.”

Miners write blocks and earn STX tokens in exchange for their BTC – at a rate of 500 STX per block. That BTC will be distributed among the stackers, who will be keeping a copy of the blockchain and also voting on which version of the chain miners should mine on.

Blockstack distinguishes this new approach from Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because node participants don’t have to put any of their assets at risk to participate, beyond the opportunity cost of agreeing to lock up their STX for some set amount of time.

“Proof of Transfer is a proposed design that uses Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) to launch new blockchains that are anchored in Bitcoin’s security,” Blockstack wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance. “Further, PoX can give incentives to earn Bitcoin rewards to participants of such new blockchains. Such Bitcoin rewards were not possible before PoX. These rewards can potentially be used for use cases like consensus participation, ecosystem developer funds, incentives for specific players, etc.”

To serve as a stacker won’t be cheap, though. It will take roughly $10,000 in STX to participate, Ali said, but like other chains with similar arrangements users won’t need to actually have that much. They can delegate to a service that maintains the node, in exchange for agreeing to lock up STX in collaboration with the node operator.

Tezos has this with its “bakers” and EOS has effectively turned staking eos to vote for validators into a money-making proposition as well, as we previously reported.

What’s new with PoX, though, is participants in the network locking up the native token don’t earn the native token for doing so. They earn BTC.

“I think the market and the entrepreneurs are starting to recognize that bitcoin is the strongest computing network in the world and therefore you can build things on top of it,” Anthony Pompliano, partner at Morgan Creek Digital, told CoinDesk.

But, given the rough outline of the proposal, Pompliano wasn’t sure the bitcoin community would get behind it.

What’s in it for miners?

Mining the Stacks blockchain will be possible with a normal internet connection and computer, Ali said. Miners will just need to watch the price of STX and the price of BTC to assess whether continued participation fits their risk profile.

“In our process of mining, the miners can model PoX mining as almost as an exchange,” Ali said. This should have some sort of arbitrage advantage early on but if all goes well that difference should shrink as participation increases, he added.

Miners’ income opportunities will also go up when Blockstack is ready to release its smart contract language, Clarity. Once miners activate it, they will start earning smart-contract fees. Ali argues Stacks may be attractive for developers looking to use smart contracts because they will be able to get extremely precise cost estimates for their code.

Blockstack will not participate in mining. The current plan, Ali said, is that once 20 miners activate the new version of the software, Blockstack 2.0 will go live. Miners will continue to have the ultimate decision about upgrades on the network.

The current version of Stacks operates atop bitcoin with the vision to eventually migrate out as its own PoW chain. This completely changes with version 2.0.

“With this thing, we basically need to never migrate from bitcoin,” Ali said.","LOS ANGELES, Feb. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Bitcoin IRA, the world's first, largest and most secure digital asset IRA technology platform that allows clients to purchase cryptocurrencies, gold and other digital assets for their retirement accounts, today announced that its clients are seeing strong returns by adding cryptocurrency to their retirement accounts.

"
2020-02-07,"The RSK project announced the creation of Token Bridge, an interoperability protocol between the Bitcoin-pegged sidechain and Ethereum, on Feb. 6. It could have important implications for the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

RSK is a smart contract platform attached as a sidechain to the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. It uses a wrapped version of Bitcoin called rBTC as its native token. Users acquire the token by depositing BTC into RSK’s bridge wallet, which works as a two-way peg.

The team has now opened a similar bridge for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows a two-way transfer of any token between the RSK and Ethereum ecosystems. This means that Ethereum users can transact with wrapped representations of RSK’s rBTC and RIF tokens, thus gaining indirect exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The same goes for RSK users, who are exposed to Ethereum-based stablecoins such as DAI.

How does it work?

When a user deposits a token from either blockchain to an address provided by RSK, an equivalent amount of the appropriate Side Token is minted in the other chain. The Side Token is written according to the ERC-777 specification, a newer token standard that is backward-compatible with the highly common ERC-20 specification.

Any standard token on either blockchain can be ported to the other through the bridge. The total supply does not change from this operation, as the original tokens are locked up until their mirror image is redeemed.

Cointelegraph reached out to Adrian Eidelman, RSK Strategist at parent company IOVLabs. He explained in more detail how the bridge works, revealing that the current system is not yet fully decentralized.

Eidelman said that to connect the two blockchains together, a federation of “well-known and respected community members” oversees the peg process. The procedure is triggered when developers on either chain interact with the bridge smart contract. Using Ethereum as an example, he explained what happens:

“The original tokens will now be locked on the Ethereum chain, and an “event” is created. At this point, the federation initiates the bridge and sends the information to the RSK chain. Once 50% or more of the federates have voted for the same transaction — the bridge on the RSK chain creates RRC20 tokens for the same amount locked on Ethereum.”

The team does not consider this a fully decentralized measure, but Eidelman reassured that the system should reach “full decentralization” by the end of Q3 2020.

Potential for Bitcoin DeFi

The DeFi movement is largely limited to Ethereum and its token ecosystem, where it recently surpassed $1 billion in locked assets. ETH is used as the main collateral asset to generate the DAI stablecoin through its complex lending system. Nevertheless, Bitcoin-based DeFi is often considered DeFi’s next frontier. In a November 2019 interview with The Spartan Group, MakerDAO’s founder Rune Christensen said:

“When it comes to a solid decentralized collateral, I think ETH is king. The only thing that can come close to ETH in terms of its importance is of course Bitcoin.”

But Bitcoin has very limited smart contract functionality, which severely limits this use case. Christensen noted that porting Bitcoin into Ethereum would allow for it to be used as collateral, pointing to existing solutions such as Wrapped BTC (WBTC).

However, WBTC’s transfer process is custodial, instead of being a decentralized atomic swap. He explained that “it is essentially impossible to build more decentralized cross-chain solutions.”

The only available solution, according to Christensen, is to have many providers of Bitcoin on Ethereum:

“The way that we have to try to solve that with Maker is rather than just for WBTC to be the sole source of Bitcoin on Ethereum, we want to have hundreds of different versions of wrapped Bitcoin.”

Thus the release of RSK’s Ethereum bridge could be an additional step toward Bitcoin-collateralized DAI living on Ethereum.

Though Maker is the biggest decentralized stablecoin provider, it is not the only one. Money on Chain is a similar project built on RSK, which uses rBTC for collateral. The project already expressed interest in using the RSK bridge to enter the Ethereum ecosystem.

RSK also sees a potential use case for Ethereum DeFi to transfer to its platform. Eidelman claimed that the Ethereum market is “experiencing many difficulties,” pointing to higher fees and lower capacity. The project sees itself as an extension of Bitcoin, which it believes is the “strongest ecosystem in the blockchain space.” Despite the close association, RSK is still its own network.

Bitcoin DeFi could be close, but it seems unlikely that it will be based on the Bitcoin blockchain.","The parent company behind the bitcoin-based smart contract platform RSK has launched a token bridge joining it to ethereum.

Gibraltar-based developer IOV Labs said this week its newly released interoperability bridge would allow users to cross RSK- and ethereum-based digital assets, including ether and ERC-20 tokens, across the different protocols.

When a user transfers tokens, the bridge’s smart contract locks the originals and mints a corresponding amount of new tokens on the other chain. Using the system, ether-based tokens can be transformed into RSK’s RRC20 tokens, which conversely can be turned into ethereum ERC777 tokens.

Interoperability protocols make it easier for projects to operate on different blockchains. Decentralized apps (dapps) can cater to a broader base of users, who would otherwise remain siloed in closed networks, and projects can leverage specific characteristics of different blockchains simultaneously.

“Interoperability has been a cornerstone of the RSK vision from the start,” explained Adrian Eidelman, RSK Strategist at IOV Labs. “We believe being able to offer Bitcoin’s benefits to Ethereum users and to connect these respective developer communities is a crucial step for the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.”

There are other protocols offering interoperability between bitcoin and ethereum: Wanchain launched a token bridge between the two networks in 2018. Edelman told CoinDesk that while Wanchain focuses on connecting blockchains by being a “middleman,” RSK is different in that it actually combines the networks, allowing both ecosystems to leverage the other’s strengths.

Bitcoin stablecoin protocol Money on Chain, which uses bitcoin as collateral for new tokens, has already said it will use the new RSK bridge to cross its stablecoins onto the ethereum ecosystem. The project’s co-founder Max Carjuzaa said the new interoperability would combine the security and “global recognition of Bitcoin with the vibrant DeFi ecosystem currently developed in Ethereum.”","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

Digital asset storage, transfer, and issuing platform Fireblocks has announced today that it is partnering with B2C2, the world’s largest cryptocurrency liquidity provider.

Fireblocks Focuses on Institutional Clients

B2C2 will deploy Fireblocks to protect billions of dollars in digital assets and secure more than 10,000 OTC trades daily.

Utilizing Fireblocks’ API, B2C2 can now securely and instantly execute large value settlements with its institutional clients. B2C2 enlisted Fireblocks to add an efficient digital asset security infrastructure to its liquidity offering.

Michael Shaulov, CEO and co-founder of Fireblocks, told Crypto Briefing:

“The complexity and uncertainty of digital asset management has created a barrier for institutional players looking to enter the crypto industry. Since Fireblocks’ inception, we have been working to secure, streamline, and simplify the movement of crypto to alleviate these issues.”

Liquidity Meets Security

Founded in 2015 and headquartered in London, with offices in the United States and Japan, readers of Profit & Loss voted B2C2 voted the Best Institutional Crypto liquidity Provider in 2019.

Trusted by retail brokerages, exchanges, banks, and fund managers to provide 24/7 liquidity, the company was one of the first professional firms to make markets in cryptocurrencies.

Fireblocks already services Galaxy Digital, Celsius, Genesis and other large institutional players. Its “Secure Transfer Environment” moves an estimated $2.5 billion in digital assets each month.

Its relationship with B2C2 has already generated enormous benefits for the liquidity provider, with Robert Catalanello, CEO of B2C2 USA saying:

“We’ve smashed our bottleneck thanks to the security and speed we’ve been able to achieve with Fireblocks’ Secure Transfer Environment. Now, we want to remove all the credit congestion downstream for our clients as well.”

As the crypto economy continues to mature, traditional digital asset ‘security-as-a-service solutions,’ which revolves around protecting keys via cold storage or hardware wallets, presents an opportunity for innovators. Fireblocks is attempting to capture a slice of this market with its patent-pending isolation security and MPC technology.

The technology enables a more seamless operational flow of digital assets, backed by an insurance policy, and mitigates against the risks of cyber attacks, human error, and internal fraud, they claim.","Source: iStock/stocknshares

If the Cryptoverse is lucky, a new app could see billions of American rewards points converted into cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin (BTC).

“The legacy payments infrastructure is ripe for disintermediation,” Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Bakkt operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) told Fortune. “The Internet should make it possible to create a direct payment system that doesn’t use a third-party set of rails. It hit us that making rewards cash-like would be a step in that direction.”

As reported this week, ICE agreed to acquire Bridge2 Solutions, a provider of loyalty solutions for merchants and consumers. When Bridge2 Solutions ultimately joins Bakkt, the strategic combination will accelerate the development of the Bakkt consumer application, which will provide digital asset aggregation, conversion, and payments through a single platform for consumers around the world, the company said.

Now, ICE revealed more details. Bridge2 operates a range of the country’s biggest loyalty redemption sites, which “hold a combined total of USD 60 billion ready-to-go rewards,” Fortune reported.

And ICE plans to develop an app with Bridge2 that would do away with credit card providers and banks, in favor of sponsor-issued digital credit cards that carry a merchant’s brand.

The companies say they are “testing a pilot program” for the app, which will be called Loyalty Pay. The app could allow users to claim rewards in four different categories.

An image provided to the media outlet by Bakkt shows a mock-up for a potential Loyalty Pay wallet, which shows a user’s funds divided into four sections, one of which is labeled “crypto.” The other three are “cash, “rewards” and “in-game” (likely currencies and tokens that can be used to buy in-game items and upgrade characters).

Fortune wrote,

“Folks could not only make purchases with the app using cash or bitcoin but also seamlessly transfer money from one category to another. “

In a recent earnings call, Sprecher stated that “the next big hurdle for the company will be getting the app into consumer hands.”

It would mean that a share of the ""USD 60 billion ready-to-go rewards,"" held by Bridge2, might be eventually converted into cryptocurrencies.

The CEO also said that Bakkt would be “looking at consumer adoption more than revenue or expense” in 2020, and enthused that Bridge 2 “has a revenue stream both from trading and from the operation of all these rewards programs for 4,500 companies.”

He added,

“[The focus will be] not so much revenue and bottom line. It is broad adoption, I think, for 2020 that we'll be looking toward.”

The CEO opined that a number of firms that run rewards programs were keen to attract younger customers – and could be keen to use crypto rewards as an incentive. He claimed that he was having “conversations across a broad range of industries” on the matter.

Sprecher said that companies were now asking themselves if “more millennials can be attracted to” Bridge2 partner companies “by virtue of having cryptocurrency in their ecosystem.”","HONG KONG, Feb. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Hong Kong-based crypto lending firm PawnHub.io is the first company of its type to obtain a license from the Government of Hong Kong.

","U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted last year he isn’t a huge fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

They’re “not money,” he wrote in July, saying their value is “highly volatile and based on thin air.”

Now, crypto traders outside the U.S. can make their feelings known – and perhaps some money – on the 45th U.S. president. This week a digital token, Trump 2020 with the symbol TRUMP, launched courtesy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

FTX says the new token will work like a futures contract, allowing traders to take long positions (Trump wins) or short ones (total loser).

“TRUMP expires to $1 if Donald Trump wins the 2020 U.S. presidential general election, and $0 otherwise,” FTX says in a posting on its website.

Some online sites, such as Oddschecker.com, have set up venues to bet on the coming election, which is shaping up to be historic: Trump is expected to be the first incumbent president to face voters following an impeachment trial. The president was acquitted Wednesday by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate of impeachment articles brought by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.

But the new FTX contract might represent the crypto industry’s first attempt to cash in on the polarized voter climate surrounding Trump’s 2020 prospects.

Theoretically, the token’s price should track roughly in line with the perceived odds of a Trump victory.

“If you think there’s a 52 percent chance of Trump winning, then TRUMP should trade at $0.52,” according to FTX. “Buying below there would be good, as would selling above $0.52.”

The token, which went live earlier this week, is currently trading at 62 cents after Trump’s acquittal, implying a 62 percent chance he’ll get four more years in Washington.

FTX is owned by a parent company based in Antigua and Barbuda, according to the firm’s website. It’s led by Sam Bankman-Fried. His LinkedIn profile shows him to be a former trader with the New York-based firm Jane Street who jumped into the crypto industry in 2017. He’s now based in Hong Kong.

For traders leery of the risks of volatile crypto markets, FTX posts a warning on the binary nature of the TRUMP token’s ultimate payoff: Price swings might be even more volatile than the notoriously up-now, down-now bitcoin. (Bitcoin is up 36 percent so far this year to about $9,800, after the price nearly doubled in 2019.)

“The risk profile of TRUMP is different from BTC,” according to the website. “It has significantly higher chances of making a large move (to $0 or $1).”","Crypto exchange BTSE has shifted its operations out of Dubai, claiming that regulators in countries with “non-permissive legal systems” are holding back the mass adoption of cryptocurrency with their inaction and broken promises. The move comes as the latest in a global game of musical chairs by crypto businesses, who have little choice but to relocate in the face of regulatory uncertainty.

The spot, futures, and fiat-crypto/crypto-fiat exchange have now joined Tether, Bitfinex, and other firms headquartered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), on account of BVI’s having a “permissive legal system” that is “more welcoming to innovation,” BTSE Co-Founder Jonathan Leong told CryptoSlate. He elaborated:

“Regulatory uncertainty is holding back cryptocurrency progress in countries with non-permissive legal systems. Exchanges have to plan ahead and it’s pretty difficult when a jurisdiction has unclear rules and regulations. Malta, for example, made a lot of promises and in the end their framework was very narrow and not particularly useful. These are the greatest barriers to more infrastructure being built to support and encourage long-term mass adoption of crypto.”

A post on the BTSE blog said the exchange had endured nearly two years of regulatory uncertainty in Dubai before the decision was made to pull the plug, after regulators failed to deliver on a long-promised legislative framework for cryptocurrencies (a framework that had originally enticed the startup to set up shop in the UAE in March 2018). The exchange has been “gradually transitioning” to the BVI since October 2019.

Regulators failing to deliver the goods

Leong said exchanges could not plan ahead in jurisdictions with “unclear rules and regulations,” and pointed to Malta — widely held up as one of the world’s most progressive regulatory regimes for blockchain and crypto—as an example of a place that had “made a lot of promises” but ultimately failed to deliver. The BTSE blog post stated:

“As many in the cryptocurrency space are well aware, crypto regulations are far from stable and often very uncertain, even when regulations in a region have already been formed. Malta presents an example of a country that was once hailed as a new crypto haven, but has made little regulatory progress.”

The tiny island nation began championing itself in 2018 as “The Blockchain Island” after passing a set of bills regulating cryptocurrencies and the companies that deal in them and attracting two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges by daily volume, Binance, and OKEx, into setting up their operational bases in Malta. By early 2019, exchanges based in Malta accounted for the majority of crypto trading volume globally.

Related: Prime Minister of Malta: Crypto is the Inevitable Future, ‘Blockchain Island’ is a Calculated Risk

But despite the Maltese government’s beckoning stance as a crypto utopia, there have been signs that crypto businesses are facing a different reality down on the ground.

In March last year “dozens” of crypto firms told the Times of Malta that they had been unable to open bank accounts on the Mediterranean island after having shifted operations there, with banks explaining that cryptocurrency was outside their “risk appetite.”

Then in August, Zebpay, one of India’s top crypto exchanges, allegedly shuttered its Malta headquarters just 11 months after having shifted to the Mediterranean island and moved operations to Singapore.

Shortly after in October, another exchange, Bittrex, announced it would be moving its headquarters from Malta to Liechtenstein. While no official explanation was given, the move came just weeks after the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) said it would start actively monitoring crypto exchanges for anti-money laundering (AML), and days after Bittrex suspended operations for customers based in 31 countries, many of which are deemed high-risk by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

That was the question posed by Blockstream’s Selene Jin at the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London on Thursday, in a room with some of the most hardcore bitcoiners on the planet.

Jin pointed out that bitcoiners on Twitter tend to argue that: “Normies don’t understand money, have no long-term vision or the ability to think outside the box.”

But she has a different opinion of what’s holding back broader adoption. More “normies” might use bitcoin if the user experience (UX) was better, if – in Silicon Valley tech speak – they were “delighted” to use the apps and felt “empowered” by them, she argued.

Jin’s comments at the two-day event spoke to the difficulty of moving the needle on crypto adoption, even with 11 years under bitcoin’s belt.

“Bitcoin UX improved a lot [over the years]. But there are ways we can improve that to push bitcoin even further,” Jin, Blockstream’s director of UX, said. She argued that most developers try to build an app with the features they want themselves, which isn’t necessarily what the average Joe is looking for.

UX is often overlooked in bitcoin’s often very technical community. Jin argued that bitcoiners are fascinated by the new currency for a variety of reasons: monetary revolution, technological exploration and getting rich. (She’s in it for all three, she said.)

“I’m trying to help fix the user experience here because if we don’t do that, these three things can’t happen,” Jin said.

Less-confusing bitcoin accounts

With the halving around the corner, it could be a particularly good time to focus on improving bitcoin’s user experience.

If the price goes up (which is still a big “if” that people are debating profusely), it could bring in a lot of new users, as is the pattern for bitcoin over the past decade.

“Think of it like ‘Hungry Hungry Hippos,'” Coinfloor exchange founder and CEO Obi Nwosu said in a panel, referencing the 1980s children’s game. “When it comes, each exchange will be trying to get as many customers as possible. We need a service that deals with their requirements,” he added, nodding to Jin’s talk.

One little-known proposal discussed at the event was to make memorizing bitcoin addresses as easy as memorizing a phone number.

Right now that’s far from the case. Instead of being fewer than 10 digits, bitcoin addresses, where bitcoin is stored and transaction IDs are long, random strings of letters and numbers.

“There is no way anyone can memorize it – unless you’re someone who memorizes digits of pi for fun. These IDs are always communicated by copy and paste,” bitcoin developer and educator Jimmy Song said.

That’s why, when he saw a proposal for EasyPaySy posted to the bitcoin developer email list, he was intrigued. EasyPaySy allows these accounts to be represented in a much easier form, as short and human-readable as a phone number or as readable as an email address.

This approach isn’t without downsides.

It would require more data to be stored on the bitcoin blockchain (the more slimmed down, the easier it is for more users to run). Plus, users potentially have to spend more time backing up such accounts. One attendee argued that the debacle involving economist and bitcoin critic Peter Schiff recently “losing his bitcoin password” showed that taking care of one’s bitcoin is already hard enough as is for many people.

Still, Song argued that the benefits might outweigh the disadvantages.

From the bottom up

But user-facing improvements aren’t the only changes being considered. Many UX improvements start at the lowest levels of the bitcoin code.

The faster developers can build new features, the faster they can bubble up to users. This realm of UX problems was probably the biggest focus of Advancing Bitcoin.

One such improvement revolves around “testnet,” a network that’s like a dummy clone of bitcoin where developers test their apps and new bitcoin features to get a better idea of how they’ll work in the real world.

Bitcoin Core contributor Kalle Alm has been building SigNet, an alternative that he describes as “testnet, but without all the broken parts.” The network is notoriously unreliable and “reorgs” all the time, an event where transactions that were considered legit for a short time, aren’t anymore. This bump is much less common on the real bitcoin network.

Plus, there are people mining testnet coins and earning no money from it, since the mined dummy coins are supposed to be free. Alm argues there isn’t a point to this, since decentralization, achieved with the help of mining, isn’t really required on testnet.

“I don’t even know what [testnet miners] are doing. No government is gonna come in and say, ‘Give me the test coins!'” Alm said.

With these problems fixed, Alm thinks SigNet could play a big role in testing network-wide features added to bitcoin. For example, developers could soon use it to test Schnorr and Taproot, a privacy and scalability-focused bundle of changes that’s been making progress this year.

But SigNet is just the tip of the iceberg. New bitcoin smart contract language Miniscript, unveiled last year, was the subject of several talks at the conference. Smart contracts require various conditions to be met in order to unlock and send funds, such as not allowing bitcoins to be sent up until a certain day.

Bitcoin’s built-in smart contract language Script is notoriously difficult to use, but Miniscript makes it easier for more developers to give it a shot, with the potential of making these smart contracts more available for more users.

Pawnhub also has offices in Switzerland, the UK, Taiwan, and Thailand, so this could be huge news.

Crypto Lending has Blossomed, is Crypto Insurance Next?

Pawnhub has big plans to become one of the premier crypto-lending firms of the Asian-Pacific region. Asian nations have a high degree of technological prowess and great enthusiasm for cryptocurrency and blockchain projects.

Many Asian nations are home to some of the largest crypto-markets, along with some of the most forward-thinking crypto-asset friendly regulations. Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong have all passed legislation to make their jurisdiction more appealing to internet money-startups.

Pawnhub’s foray into crypto-lending could be huge. The crypto-lending industry has become one of the fastest and most profitable sub-sectors of the overall crypto-asset investment climate of the last 2 years.

Pawnhub was able to secure a government license in Hong Kong, as well as announced that they will be partnering with a leading US crypto-asset custody firm, in order to offer insurance of up to $100 million, anywhere in the world, to cover their client’s Bitcoin holdings.

Digital currency lending has been growing at an alarming pace, however, it is still very tiny when compared to traditional lending markets. The entire crypto market itself is only $280 billion at the time of writing.

This is minuscule when compared to the markets of other asset classes which are in the trillions. The potential for growth is astronomical. Pawnhub wants to be an innovator in this rapidly growing sector.

Digital Asset Lending is Making Headlines as the Industry Grows

Pawnhub is just the most recent virtual currency lending business to capture headlines, the industry has been in the spotlight lately, as one of the few successful sectors of the overall industry that grew during the crypto winter.

Startups like Celsius and Blockfi have had alarming growth, and Pawnhub is aiming to achieve similar success in Asian markets. Pawnhub’s fee structure is transparent and they are providing liquidity for digital asset holders who don’t want to give up their coins.

Lending could be one of the most important parts of the crypto industry as it allows coin holders to have access to fiat without giving up their ownership of their bearer assets, during a bear market. The interest on the loan can easily be paid back with the gains during a bull market.

We may see this emerge as a major strategy for miners and other types of crypto investors who feel the liquidity crunch when prices plummet.

The potential for growth and the early success of crypto-lending startups may cause a stampede of new startups looking to get in on the action, which will bring down fees as borrowers have better options. It could be the start of something big.

What do you think of Pawnhub’s new government license? Let us know in the comments!

Decred, a hybrid Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (Pos) crypto network, turns four today. And unlike the average, fickle altcoin project, Decred’s message has been clear since 2016: Be a better Bitcoin.

But how close has it come to achieving this objective? Crypto Briefing asked two of the protocol’s most active researchers to find out.

A 10,000 Foot Perspective

The hybrid consensus mechanism used to mine each and every Decred (DCR) token is one of the protocol’s strongest selling points.

Enthusiasts have indicated time and again that this mechanism is more secure than networks using exclusively one or the other. Understanding how it operates is relatively straightforward.

Like Bitcoin, miners in the Decred network work to produce blocks. Unlike Bitcoin, Decred’s blocks must be again verified by stakeholders, or in Decred parlance, PoS ticket holders. These tickets can be purchased with DCR tokens in an open auction. Every Decred block announces 20 tickets for sale.

At the time of press, one ticket currently costs an estimated 135.11 DCR, or ~$2,868. Token holders are allowed to bid on as many tickets as they can afford.

To participate, DCR holders must first wait for the Decred network to announce an open bid on a ticket via users’ wallet software. Interested parties then place their bid and wait for the miners to include it in an upcoming block. The bid joins a pool of bids for the same 20 tickets.

Ticket holders still need to wait 24 hours before using their ticket to vote on an incoming block, however.

Five PoS tickets in the network are pseudo-randomly selected to validate a mined block. Three of them must validate the block mined for the block to be attached to the blockchain. If this validation fails for whatever reason, the blocks must be mined again.

If successful, then the block reward is split three ways: 60% to miners, 30% to winning ticket votes, and 10% to the Decred treasury.

One can think of Decred as having added a functional social layer on top of the mining protocol. Token holders, or those most incentivized to benefit from a healthy network, can actively participate in the project’s security. It is in their best interests to behave honestly because it is also the most economically sound choice in this network.

Thus, attacking the Decred network is slightly more complicated than a brute force 51% mining attack. Malicious agents would need both a majority of the hashing power and the majority of the tickets in the network.

Assuming the cost of mining equipment, market cap, and hashpower is the same as pure-play PoW networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, one analyst, Zubair Zia, concluded in 2018 that “Decred would be ~22 times costlier to attack than Bitcoin and ~9 times more expensive to attack than Etheruem.”

The above outline is only the foundation. Since launching this hybrid consensus mechanism, a lot has been added to Decred in the past four years.

Decred’s Governance Experiments

“I only found Decred in early 2018, so I can only really speak to the past two years,” said Permabull Niño in a Twitter conversation with Crypto Briefing. “The biggest thing for me is how much has been built in that time, which was an extended bear market.”

My crypto investment philosophy summarized in a graphic, and why I'm only willing to hold BTC and DCR. Dominant coins within a certain ledger assurance model will be the big winners is my bet pic.twitter.com/JKgMAqtklw — Permabull Niño (@PermabullNino) December 21, 2018

More than armchair crypto analysts, both Permabull and Checkmate have been hard at work researching, documenting, and getting the word out about all of the developments happening in Decred. The two have been so prolific, the Decred community has practically employed the duo to be its spokespeople.

In the same year that Permabull began digging into the nuances of the cryptocurrency, Decred launched Politeia. The initiative offers additional powers to ticket-voting stakeholders beyond helping with block confirmation. Indeed, the entire vision of the project, not just its security, has been handed over to the community.

Stakeholders can lance proposals for 0.1 DCR, and the rest of the community can vote and discuss the proposal through the Politeia portal. Like proposals, it costs 0.1 DCR to create a Politeia account. This cost is in place to prevent the rise of sock puppets and other forms of spam.

Proposals fall into two broad categories — those that looking for voter support to make a change to the protocol, or those that hope to draw funding from the Decred Treasury.

The latest proposal, for instance, is for a research grant to fund the work of Checkmate and Permabull.

“The goal is to build more charts on metrics that are specific to Decred,” Checkmate said in an interview with Crypto Briefing. This data would then be used to better understand Decred’s behavior as well as offer investors a more comprehensive understanding of the project.

Checkmate added:

“I believe [Decred is] the most important coin next to Bitcoin and want to explore what the data indicates and what the fundamental potential of the project is.”

To complete the task, Checkmate, along with Permabull, has asked the community for $17,500 for roughly eight months of work. Critically, this is the second proposal of the same nature; Checkmate asked for $12,000 in July 2019 for similar work. The community voted 92.3% in favor to pursue the research at that time.

The first proposal was also an opportunity to corral some of the more active members of the Decred community. This includes Richard Red, Murad Mahmadov, Zubair Zia, and others.

Once a proposal is approved by the community, the requisite funds are drawn from the treasury. If one remembers earlier, the treasury is replenished with 10% of the block reward each time a block is mined and validated by voters. At the time of press, the treasury holds 643,405.27025766 DCR, or $13.7 million.

Successful proposals have been wide-ranging, too. The community voted on whether to hire Wachsman, a blockchain-focused marketing agency, for instance. Other proposals have included creating video content, developing Decred-integrated ATMs, performing a bug bounty, and setting up a Decred-native decentralized exchange (DEX).

As for 2020, Permabull said that he is most excited about the upcoming DEX. “I think a lot of people are sleeping on its potential and over time it will become a key piece of crypto infrastructure,” they said.

For Checkmate, Decred is ahead of most other projects entering the decade. “As for fundamental potential of the project, the biggest narratives coming up are privacy, Chainalysis, KYC, security in the face of expanding derivatives (ability to short and 51% attack), funding, and governance,” they said. Concluding:

“Decred has solved these issues long before they showed up elsewhere. So far, betting against convention has paid off.”

But is it better than Bitcoin yet? The question isn’t yet relevant, according to Permabull.

“When Decred is larger in scale, the comparison between it and Bitcoin will be more appropriate.” Instead, Permabull takes solace in another thought. They said:

“Bitcoin changed the way I look at money, and Decred changed the way I look at cryptocurrencies.”

Whether it will eventually outpace the premier cryptocurrency is pure speculation. But as many throughout the crypto space experiment with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and the challenges of governance, one may not need to look much further than Decred.","Let's recap what happened in this crypto week. Total value locked in DeFi hit 1 billion! The public war-of-words between the co-founders of the IOTA Foundation took a fresh turn, Bitspark will close due to internal issues despite reporting positive results, but the first phase of Ethereum 2.0 is most likely coming this year. While Mike Novogratz believes ETH, XRP and many other alts are in their 'proving phase,' and Celsius CEO gave three reasons why Bitcoin might reach USD 30K in 2020, we discussed why ICE's acquisition of eBay would be relevant for crypto, and Binance co-owned FTX added TRUMP-2020 futures market. Meanwhile, billions of dollars could be converted into BTC, ETC will have two parallel upgrades, and a lawyer warned not to get too excited about Crypto Mom's ICO plan.

What else happened? The South Korean central bank is launching a second CBDC team in what appears to be a direct response to China’s plans to issue a digital yuan, while the banks and financial services providers are turning to blockchain, and the country is inching closer to crypto tax legislation. The head of the Russian Duma’s digital economy commission insisted that crypto and blockchain legislation will be in place before the year’s end, and American Fed said it's looking into the possibility of CBDC issuance. Meanwhile, fourteen of Japan’s biggest banks and securities companies will begin running a pilot for a blockchain-powered inheritance platform. Traditional financial advisors are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about digital assets, and Sony showed their interest in security tokens when they made an indirect, undisclosed investment in Securitize. Meanwhile, North Korean hackers used LinkedIn and Telegram for their USD 7 million DragonEx hack, while MLB players are allegedly among the victims of American crypto fund scam.

And more things happened. Arthur Hayes shared new yield-producing strategies for options traders. You can now use BTC emoji in your tweets, Handshake introduced a new way to send your crypto, and Twitter's Jack Dorsey was unreachable to confirm or deny that he was awarded the second Lightning Torch.

Now, let's relax with some jokes.

And lastly, here's some people asking for an emoji.","A recent blog post from the digital currency exchange Coinbase suggests Bitcoin may soon become ”digital gold”. Specifically, Coinbase suggests that the premier cryptocurrency will take a massive step towards that end in just 93 days.

Many analysts already call Bitcoin ”digital gold”

This is not the first time that analysts refer to Bitcoin as ”digital gold”. In fact, the premier cryptocurrency is routinely said to be a digital equivalent of that precious yellow metal. The reasoning behind this is that Bitcoin, much like gold, provides a stable store-of-value.

As such, the asset class is able to weather periods of market volatility and uncertainty. Numerous investors also suggest that Bitcoin is a modern store-of-value and, put simply, ”digital gold”. With that said, Coinbase now joins the chorus of those hailing Bitcoin as digital gold and says similarities are increasing.

This news came in a Coinbase blog post on February 7th. In it, and in an accompanying tweet-storm, Coinbase went all out promoting Bitcoin as ”digital gold”.

Bitcoin halving will make Bitcoin more like digital gold than ever

Interestingly, Coinbase also goes into the statistics as to why Bitcoin is approaching a status of digital gold. Additionally, Coinbase also hails the upcoming Bitcoin halving as a critical step towards truly becoming digital gold.

The Coinbase post looks at when the gold standard was broken in 1971. Since then, the dollar’s value relative to gold has fallen drastically, which the following chart demonstrates. The value of gold in dollar terms, on the other hand, has risen roughly 4,000% since 1971.

Moreover, the key reason as to gold’s enduring and increasing value is its scarcity, and difficulty to acquire (mine). The scarcity of gold means that governments around the world can’t just produce more gold. Instead, gold has a finite supply, and only 190,000 tons have ever been mined.

Much like gold, Bitcoin also requires mining and is intentionally scarce. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity actually decreases. This is due to Bitcoin’s ”halving” processes, which take place every fourth year.

What will the Bitcoin halving do to the Bitcoin price?

Bitcoin’s next halving event will take place on roughly May 14th- or in about 93 days. Many analysts suggest that this occasion could drive the price of Bitcoin higher than ever. The following chart shows the price performance of Bitcoin over the course of the last two halving events.

One analyst has said that the halving will lead to a Bitcoin price of $55,000. Just a few days ago, another said that Bitcoin’s halving will boost the premier crypto’s price to $30,000 in 2020.

A popular model for measuring how supply rate over total supply affects assets is the ”stock-to-flow” (S2F) measure. What’s more, the Bitcoin halving will effectively double the S2F ratio, due to cutting new supply in half.

In conclusion, the Coinbase post points out that Bitcoin’s halving in roughly 93 days will likely make the premier crypto more like ”digital gold” than ever before. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin also comes with a long list of technological advances that make it more efficient than gold.","Nischal Shetty

As we live in an era of ‘Fake News’, myths and misconceptions can be seen easily building all around us. Unfortunately, such Fake News can also be found spreading around the cryptocurrency market in India. To give you a contrast, the global market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is more than $250 billion, up from around $190 billion during the beginning of this year. In fact, even the lowest market capitalization after the infamous crypto crash was $102 billion (December 2018).

This is when Fake News has eroded substantial investor sentiment from the market. Cryptocurrencies experience volatility just like fiat currencies, however, they are more robust given that they’re backed by technology. Its market capitalization is growing and the only way it has to go is the way up. Just try and imagine its true potential if the crypto market also gathers the support of regular investors. It will be simply remarkable.



Crypto trading is illegal in India: This is the biggest myth that circulates within our country around crypto trading. It is false because there’s no regulation at all on cryptocurrencies in India. The Government of India is yet to come up with laws around cryptocurrencies and until then, Indians are free to own and trade in cryptocurrencies. It’s true that the RBI doesn’t allow Indian exchanges to hold bank accounts. But this doesn’t make crypto trading illegal because the power to legalise or criminalise something lies with the government. This particular stance of the Reserve Bank of India’s dates back to 2018 when it disallowed people from depositing in INR. It was an arbitrary measure taken without any prior research or consultation of industry players. Moreover, this move is being challenged in the Supreme Court.



So, let us have a look at some of the myths and misconceptions around crypto dealing in India, especially the ones around P2P trade:

2. You can be defrauded in a P2P trade: In P2P trade, the INR transaction happens between two individuals, i.e., the buyer pays directly to the seller’s bank account. So, there is a popular myth that despite transferring the crypto (or the money), the other person might not fulfill his/her obligation. This is also not true. In order to check this, the exchange keeps the cryptocurrency in an escrow account and transfers it only when the transaction is confirmed. Even if any dispute arises between the transacting parties, it gets easily resolved.

3. P2P is slow and complicated: Well, it’s not. WazirX, for instance, has the world’s first auto-matching P2P engine. So, the interface and experience are similar to the trading exchange. Any transaction takes around 15 minutes on average to get completed.

4. P2P is unsafe: Another myth is that the P2P trade is unsafe and there are no measures to guarantee the credibility of traders. Again, this is just a myth. Crypto exchanges have KYC-verified traders, so you know you’re dealing with legitimate traders. Also, an organization (such as the exchange itself) acts as escrow, thereby ensuring that the funds aren’t transferred until the seller confirms receiving the payment.

Cryptocurrencies became a global fad over the yesteryears. And why wouldn’t they? Their sheer ingenuity as a novel tech-driven tender and the revolutionary technology backing them, i.e. blockchain, have fueled this trend. These reasons are perhaps why the cryptocurrency market continues to receive high footfall of everyone from technocrats to the general masses. If you have been avoiding the burgeoning market because of these myths and misconceptions, maybe it is time for you to reconsider your decision.","Cryptocurrency Futures and Prediction Markets Show Trump Wins the US 2020 Election

In less than 270 days the United States will have its 2020 election and millions of people worldwide will be betting on whether Donald Trump is reelected. Cryptocurrency participants are currently wagering their digital assets on the election outcome, where the odds on prediction markets and betting sites indicate Trump will likely win.

Crypto Traders Are Betting Donald Trump Will Win the US 2020 Election

Whether you love him or hate him, Donald Trump gathers a lot of attention and the U.S. will be facing another presidential election soon. On February 6, the crypto trading platform FTX Exchange revealed a futures contract based on the 2020 U.S. election results. FTX is letting traders who do not live in America the chance to purchase short and long positions on Donald Trump winning the election in November. The exchange launched a token called TRUMP to represent the futures agreement. (TRUMP) is a futures contract on FTX,” the company noted. [The token] expires to $1 if Donald Trump wins the 2020 US presidential general election, and $0 otherwise.”

At the time of publication, each token is trading for $0.62, which means as of today the odds are in favor (62% chance) of Trump being reelected, according to FTX traders. The exchange FTX is not the only business running the odds and placing bets on the 2020 U.S. election. Gambling operations and bookmaking sites all over the internet are offering people the chance to bet for or against Donald Trump this year. For the most part, the odds across the board look to be in favor of Trump winning. For example, US-bookies.com disclosed at the end of 2019 that bookmakers in the country say Trump will win the election. The company researches and tracks bookmaking and gambling operations located in the U.S.

“Over the past week, Mr. Trump went from 1/1 to 10/11 to win the 2020 Presidential election,” the company stressed. Just recently the head of public relations at the UK bookmaking firm Paddy Power, Lee Price, also explained the odds are in favor of Trump winning again. “This time, he’s odds on, so, more likely than not to be reelected,” Price said.

Trump Bets Using the Prediction Market Augur and Gambling Sites That Accept Crypto for Election Wagers

Cryptocurrency users are also leveraging the prediction market Augur built on the Ethereum blockchain to bet on the election. With the Augur platform, users can create prediction markets so people can utilize the software in order to predict certain outcomes. One popular Augur market called “Who will be the 2020 Republican Nominee for president?” has $20,594 at stake and ends in nine months. According to the Augur platform, there’s a 95% chance Donald Trump will win the election in 2020.

This particular Augur market is a multiple-choice market and the website predictions.global explains “this is the predicted and winning choice.” Additionally, the second most popular prediction market on the Augur platform is also about the 2020 election. The question is: “Will Donald J. Trump be elected and be inaugurated as President of the United States for the 2021-2025 presidential term?” Augur’s prediction declares 55% say “yes” Trump will be elected and inaugurated again this year.

Besides the new FTX TRUMP futures contracts and the bets on Augur, a slew of online betting sites that are hosting election wagers also accept digital currencies for betting. Sites like Betmoose, Fairlay, Mybookieag, Sportsbookag, Vegaselectionodd.com, and Oddsshark will allow registered users to bet on the U.S. 2020 election by leveraging $5 to $5,000 worth of cryptocurrencies. Most of these websites also show that Trump is favored to win and other candidates with decent odds include Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren.

2020-02-09,"How to Use a U2F Key to Secure Your Crypto Accounts

Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) is an open standard for strengthening two-factor authentication. It involves the use of a physical key to reinforce 2FA, hardening your online accounts from attack. In this guide, we’ll explain how to use a Yubikey to lock down your exchange account, email account, and other valuable online accounts.

Also read: German Economy in Risk of Recession Amid Weak Demand, Tariff Threat, and Epidemic



U2F Is Physical 2FA for the Security Conscious

If you’re at heightened risk of online attack, say, cos you’re a sysadmin or cryptocurrency trader, you should take steps to secure your accounts. Most bitcoiners already use 2FA, such as the Google Authenticator app, to secure their crypto accounts. U2F takes that to another level by mandating use of a physical key that is inserted into the USB port of your device, or held in proximity to your smartphone if it’s an NFC key. Even in the event of malware being installed on your computer, or your 2FA recovery codes being stolen, a U2F key should keep attackers at bay.

For the purposes of this guide, we’ll be using a Yubikey, one of the most popular devices on the market. (Google, for its part, also recommends the Feitian keys.) Manufacturer Yubico boasts “Zero recorded account takeovers in 11 years” because “the physical key requires a human touch and cannot be remotely hacked.” Lose your key, however, and things get a little complicated, since unlike Google Authenticator, Yubikeys don’t come with recovery codes. We’ll troubleshoot that problem shortly, once we’ve covered the basics.

One Key to Secure Them All

Yubikeys retail for around $50 apiece and, like hardware wallets, are best ordered direct from the manufacturer to prevent tampering. Yubico supplies a range of keys including a Nano version whose compactness makes it suitable for leaving permanently plugged in to the USB slot of a trusted desktop computer. The 5 series is the range that most consumers will opt for. They’re designed to secure Google, Microsoft, Github, Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter, and Lastpass accounts, as well as various crypto related platforms.

Yubico works with Binance, Bitfinex, Bitmex, Kraken, and hundreds more companies across dozens of industries. Attend any developer-oriented crypto conference and you’ll see U2F keys plugged into laptops and dangling from keychains worn by delegates. You don’t have to be in charge of your team’s Github repo to warrant a Yubikey, however – simply holding crypto on a centralized exchange can be cause enough. Plus, in an era of NFC, biometrics, QR codes, and contactless payments, it feels badass to be carrying a physical key with magical powers.

Using Your U2F Key

If you’re intent on locking down your accounts with the aid of a Yubikey or similar U2F device, the first place to start is your email. If you’re a Google user, the Advanced Protection portal will guide you through the process. Other email providers including Protonmail also support the U2F protocol.

Next, you should secure your cryptocurrency accounts, including any exchanges you trade on, in the same manner. Add a Yubikey to your Binance account, for instance, and you’ll be prompted to plug it into your computer every time you log in or withdraw. It effectively replaces the 2FA you will have been using up until now.

If you’re wondering what happens if your U2F key is lost, broken, or stolen, many sites will let you pair multiple keys, providing redundancy in the event of key loss. Unfortunately, Binance is not one of them. Lose your key and you’ll need to initiate Binance’s account recovery process, which may take a few days to complete and will require alternate verification.

U2F keys aren’t perfect, then, or to be more accurate, there are situations where their security model comes at the expense of convenience. If you’re intent on using one, though, that’s a sacrifice you’ll be willing to make in the quest of greater security. Where possible, pair two U2F keys with each of your online accounts, and keep your master key securely stored on a chain at all times. Once implemented, using a U2F key every time you log in will become second nature.

What’s your experience of using U2F keys? Would you recommend them? Let us know in the comments section below.

London-based cryptocurrency exchange LBX is the latest digital asset trading venue to face critical difficulties and is now being liquidated. Despite rising crypto prices, which typically lead to an influx of new traders, some regulated exchanges have struggled to survive amidst rising legal fees, compliance costs, and other overheads.

LBX Placed Into Compulsory Liquidation

Dragon Payments Limited, formerly known as London Block Exchange Limited and trading as LBX, has been placed into compulsory liquidation following a winding up order that was made against the company on January 31, 2020. This is a legal term for when someone applies to the court in the U.K. asking to close down a company if it cannot pay its debts.

According to a notice that replaced the platform’s front page, Paul Cooper and Paul Appleton, both of David Rubin & Partners, were appointed joint liquidators of LBX on February 4, 2020 by order of the U.K.’s Secretary of State. The joint liquidators and their team are said to be working toward resolving client concerns as a matter of priority, including the recovery of any sums of money owed to them, and ask that all claims for repayments should be addressed to them directly.

LBX had opened in November 2017 for OTC trades and was based in London’s Canary Wharf commercial district. The multi-cryptocurrency platform provided crypto exchange services to retail consumers and institutional investors via an online platform and through a mobile app. It followed very strict know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering procedures as it was also an e-wallet services provider registered with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

In October 2018 we reported that LBX launched a service offering access to an account where clients can store, manage and transfer their fiat currency and cryptocurrency holdings. Aimed at the business sector, LBX Pay offered a banking-like solution to those involved in the cryptocurrency industry such as ICOs, traders and funds. The service enabled clients to convert holdings from fiat and cryptocurrency without having to move funds between accounts or service providers.

It has done so despite being outperformed by altcoins and a hint of the altseason holding it back. In the past, this has meant Bitcoin’s dominance plummeting and struggling prices. With the $10K psychological resistance now achieved many experts expect that Bitcoin will moon.

Bitcoin At $20K Coming Up?

Despite Bitcoin dominance dropping from highs of 70% to under 64% in the last few weeks, Bitcoin has continued to soar. Since the turn of the year, the digital asset has soared by more than 40%. And the bull phase could just be getting started.

The $10K position is set to usher in a new bullish phase. This time, BTC should surpass the 2019 year high of $14,000 and go on to retest the ATH of $20K. But before this, a correction is in order.

BTC seems to have stalled at the $10,100 position. The bulls need to find a higher resistance to avoid support below $10K. Every time BTC has a dramatic surge, it goes through a correction, and the higher the resistance the higher the support. At $10,100, a correction could see it fall back below $10K.

But like Ethereum which has been on an incredible rally, the digital asset could continue rallying fueled by FOMO to new highs without a correction.

$10,100 #BITCOIN CONFIRMED ON @CoinMarketCap Something tell me we will jump straight to $11,000 before a correction… we’ll see — Ivan on Tech (@IvanOnTech) February 9, 2020

In fact, if the digital asset follows the same trend as that seen in the last few years, BTC could be gearing up to go parabolic.

In 2017 #Bitcoin went from $10,000 to $20,000 IN A FEW WEEKS!! In 2019 it went from $10,000 to $14,000 IN JUST A FEW DAYS!! Crossing $10K historically catapulted us quickly even higher… — Bitcoin Liz⚡️? (@LizBitcoin) February 9, 2020

This Is The Real Deal

In 2019, we saw a BTC breakout of $10K to reach a year high of $14,000. Unfortunately, this was a false breakout and due to lack of strong fundamentals, Bitcoin slipped back below this level. This time, Bitcoin is stronger than ever.

The network is now stronger than during the 2017 bull season, macroeconomics is supporting the rally, and as analyst Will Woo has been pointing out, fundamentals can confirm that this is the real deal.

In addition to all this, Bitcoin’s reward halving is now weeks away.

In the next few days, it will be impossible for investors to take their eyes away from the market. The next key target is $14K.

2020-02-10,"Major digital asset financial services firm BitGo is expanding its global reach by setting up two new regulated custodial entities in Europe.

BitGo, a United States-based firm that claims to process over 20% of all Bitcoin (BTC) transactions, has established new custodial subsidiaries in Switzerland and Germany, the company announced Feb. 10.

As the two new entities are regulated by different financial authorities, BitGo intends to allow its clients to choose the jurisdiction that is best suited to their business.

As such, BitGo GmbH, the Swiss entity of BitGo, is a member of the country’s major self-regulatory organization, the Financial Services Standards Association, which is overseen by the Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA. BitGo’s German subsidiary, BitGo Deutschland GmbH, is now providing custody services in Germany and is set to apply for regulatory approval in November 2020.

Mike Belshe, CEO at BitGo, noted that the launch of new custodial entities in Europe follows increased demand for the services in the region in 2019.

Founded in 2013 in Palo Alto, California, BitGo initially emerged as a major platform for storing Bitcoin online. In 2018, BitGo became a qualified custodian for cryptocurrencies after the firm received a state trust company charter from the South Dakota Division of Banking. To date, BitGo reportedly supports more than 250 coins and tokens with customers spanning over 50 countries, the firm said in the announcement.

Germany and Switzerland open their doors to cryptocurrency business

Belshe also pointed out that Switzerland and Germany have become some of the most friendly jurisdictions for crypto business:

“Switzerland and Germany have both become important European centers for digital assets as well as for forward-thinking regulatory frameworks. Regulatory compliance is a prerequisite for our clients, and we have been impressed with the understanding and support of Swiss and German regulators.”

Indeed, Germany is reportedly considering a bill that could enable banks to support the sale and custody of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by 2020. Meanwhile, Julius Baer, a major Swiss private banking and wealth management group, launched a digital asset trading and custodial service on Jan. 21.

However, the local crypto ecosystem in the country is still being extensively monitored by regulators, with FINMA recently passing a law that would reduce the threshold for unidentified crypto exchange transactions from around $5,100 to $1,020.","The price of bitcoin surpassed $10,000 for the first time since September, as the leading cryptocurrency continues its rally in 2020.

It rose as much as 2.6% to $10,179 last Sunday, capping a gain of about 40% so far this year, according to Bitstamp pricing. With the surge above $10,000, the cryptocurrency's market capitalization has jumped to $183bn. The cryptocurrency is now up more than $3,500 from the low of $6,425 registered in mid-December.

""This breakout is the real deal. Fundamental investment activity is backing this $10k breakout,"" Willy Woo, partner at Adaptive Capital, tweeted early Sunday.

Cryptocurrencies have been on an upward trend all year, with some analysts and digital-asset enthusiasts suggesting they've benefited as safe-haven plays amid ongoing geopolitical concerns around the globe.

Ethereum is up 20% over the past five days and nearly 78% higher year to date. So far in 2020, Ripple is up 49%, bitcoin cash is 121% higher and Litecoin is up 88%.

Some Bitcoin enthusiasts are predicting further gains. Fundstrat Global Advisors' Rob Sluymer, for one, sees it rising through the second quarter this year to trade in a range of $10,000 to $11,000.

Bitcoin peaked at almost $20,000 in December 2017 and finished that year up about 1,400% as the cryptocurrency burst into the mainstream. It plunged 74% the next year, before rebounding almost 100% in 2019.

The crypto rally coincides with new record highs on Wall Street; while all three benchmark indexes — the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite they closed Thursday at new highs before retreating on Friday.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Although cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, where each transaction is a strict set of accurate digits that form a cryptographic hash, people are still creative in the industry. These professionals all come from differing backgrounds—one person might have come from working in development, whilst another from economics, or a director from an executive corporate environment, but one thing they all have in common is their imagination and willingness to think outside of the box. Each of our heroes are united by that rare quality of being visionaries with the ability to spot and seize and act upon the technological opportunities of the future. For each of them their victory is to analyse, to innovate, to build, and to implement an effective action strategy for success.

Today, we’ve gathered the top 10 most influential people in the cryptocurrency market—the creators of the largest projects that have influenced the development of the entire industry.

Satoshi Nakamoto

The creator of Bitcoin

Age: Unknown

Rocking in as the undisputed number one on our list is ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ the creator of Bitcoin, and the most mysterious personality in the cryptocurrency industry. Indeed, not only does nobody know whether it is one person, or a group of developers, the very fact that of whether this legendary figure actually exists has often been called into question. Is Satoshi Nakamoto just a pseudonym?

Be that as it may, it was ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ who developed the Bitcoin protocol and created the first version of the software.

Of course, there’s a wealth of speculation as to real identify of ‘Nakamoto,’ and several theories have come to light to unmask him. Indeed, as we seek to unmask his true identify, let’s take a look at the two leading suspects.

Nick Szabo is one of the rumoured candidates for the ‘Nakamoto’ crown. Szabo is a well-known cryptologist and lawyer, the developer of smart contract technology, the Bit Gold algorithm of decentralised virtual currency and the publication of which appeared just a few short months before Nakamoto's article on Bitcoin.

Craig Wright is one of the most scandalous candidates for being the real Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2015, this Australian entrepreneur told the world that it was he who created the unique technology and filed more than 150 patent applications for the authorship of distributed registry technology, smart contracts, and six cryptocurrencies. In his favour, the patents were undisputed, and this didn’t lead to any legal consequences.

Vitalik Buterin

The founder of Ethereum

Age: 26 years old

Buterin gained his fame as the creator of the world's second-largest digital currency in terms of capitalization: Ethereum. Buterin is a true child prodigy: at the tender age of just 7, he wrote his first computer game using Excel macros! Then, aged 10 he studied C ++ and began developing full-fledged games. Blockchain arrived into his life in 2011, and by 2013 he’d already realized the shortcomings of Bitcoin. This gave him the idea to create his own unique cryptocurrency platform, and by 2014 he had funded and launched his project Ethereum through an online crowd-sale.

It can be said that it was Buterin who indirectly initiated the ICO (initial coin offering)-hype, made the Ethereum code open-source (made it available to the general public). This allowed hundreds of developers to write their own projects on the Ethereum blockchain, while saving resources and time. Tokens created on Ethereum are called ERC-20 (Ethereum Request For Comments and 20)—today there are more than a thousand.

Pavel Durov

The founder of VK and Telegram

Age: 35 years old

Pavel Durov is the talented Russian entrepreneur and the developer best known for founding the social networking site VK, and then later Telegram. At just 22 years of age, Durov had already launched his social network VKontakte, but at 28 he was forced to leave the project due to disagreements with shareholders. This allowed him to focus on Telegram—the messenger that brought Durov worldwide fame. By the end of 2017, Telegram was already worth more than $1 billion, which made its creator a dollar billionaire.

Until 2018, the name of Durov wasn’t associated with cryptocurrencies, however, in that Telegram announced the development of the Telegram Open Network—a secure embedded proxy and blockchain platform anonymizer. Durov plans to launch messaging and data storage services on it, as well as payment tools in his own cryptocurrency of the GRAM project. They will also add the ability for developers to create their own applications. 2018 also marked the time when the messenger attracted $1.7 billion from more than 170 investors for the development of new two projects: the Gram cryptocurrency, and the TON blockchain platform.

Changpen Zhao

The founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance

Age: 43 years old

The Chinese Canadian Changpen Zhao is one of the most prominent figures in the crypto industry. He’s the founder and CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, as of April 2018, an international cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in Hong Kong. Changpen Zhao is better known in the cryptocurrency community as CZ. And, CZ has an enormous following. His Twitter account has almost half a million crypto zombie followers who feast on reading his hundreds of articles and posts and hanging on his every word. With an estimated net worth, according to the Forbes rich list, of $1.2 billion, Zhao earned his first billion dollar in less than six months and is today one of the richest representatives of the crypto industry.

Since the beginning of his career, CZ has specialised in trading—he first worked in the IT department of the New York Stock Exchange, and then moved on to Bloomberg to develop a service for traders. Thanks to the experience of the fundraising, it took the Binance exchange only 180 days to become the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Today, according to the exchange’s blog, the average daily trading volume of Binance is $2,852,591,354, with more than 15 million traders from around the world trading on the exchange. Additionally, Binance is one of the few exchanges that provides margin and futures trading services.

Brian Armstrong

The co-founder of Coinbase

Age: 35 years old

Brian Armstrong is the founder and CEO of Coinbase, a California cryptocurrency exchange. Brian has been interested in development since his high school days—as a teenager he studied the Java and CSS programming languages, and then, having received two degrees in computer science and economics, he worked as a programmer for major companies.

In 2012, after receiving venture capital funding, he launched Coinbase—one of the world’s first cryptocurrency exchanges. Today, Coinbase is one of the most popular platforms for exchanging fiat money for cryptocurrencies. Traders can buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether and Litecoin using their regular bank cards. In August 2017, when cryptocurrency fever first swept the world, the mobile version of the Coinbase exchange in the AppStore became the most downloaded application in the US.

Brandon Chez

The CEO and founder Coinmarketcap

Age: 33 years old

Brandon Chaz is a 33-year-old US programmer, and the founder of Coinmarketcap, the largest online cryptocurrency aggregator. This site consolidates data from all exchanges and based on this data determines the value of cryptocurrency. Users can learn basic information about cryptocurrencies: capitalization, price, number of circulating coins, trading volume in 24 hours, percentage of price change per hour, 24 hours, and per week.

The name of Brandon Chez is associated with the largest crash in the cryptocurrency market in history. On January 8, 2018, almost all cryptocurrencies fell in value by 15 per cent or more, and the market capitalization decreased by $100,000,000,000. Chez was figured as the culprit; it turns out that on February 7, his Coinmarketcap excluded data from South Korean exchanges without warning, the prices of which are consistently above the world average, and resultantly, the value of Bitcoin fell, pulling down all the other cryptocurrencies along with it.

Charlie Lee

Litecoin creator

Age: Unknown

Charlie Lee is a talented programmer and computer scientist from Japan, an iconic figure in the crypto industry, and the creator of the third cryptocurrency in history: Litecoin. Before Litecoin, Lee worked as a developer for Google. He learnt about blockchain in 2011 by reading an article on Bitcoin. The innovative technology was incredibly interesting to him, and he immediately bought one Bitcoin for $30. In that same year, in October 2011, Lee created the open source cryptographic protocol Litecoin, an early Bitcoin spinoff of Altcoin, and also got a job at the largest Coinbase exchange. In the summer of 2017, Charlie Lee left Coinbase and completely focused on developing Litecoin.

The main purpose of Litecoin is payments on the Internet. In addition, like Ethereum, on Litecoin’s blockchain developers can create their own applications.

Alex Reinhardt

The Founder of PLATINCOIN

Age: 38 years old

Alex Reinhardt is a serial entrepreneur, and venture investor from Germany. Alex is the founder of more than 10 projects in the IT and fintech industries with a total capitalisation of over €200 million. In 1996, when Alex was 15 years old, his family emigrated to Germany and lived on social security benefits for the first few years. None of the family knew German, so they faced many challenges, were living hand to mouth, and facing a difficult future. It was Reinhardt who pulled the family up by the bootstraps and used his charisma to help him to urgently learn to speak the German language. The rest, as they say is history, and by the 11th grade, in 1998, Alex had begun to earn thousands of marks by selling products to German pension funds. Between 2002 and 2013, he was involved in attracting investments in start-ups and young companies, and in just over 10 years he’d raised more than €500,000,000 for them.

In 2015, he survived the betrayal of partners who had effectively bankrupted his business. Huge debts and the necessity to pay bills became a call to action, so by using all his experience and innate talent as a salesman, as well as his brilliant experience in crypto trading, Alex launched his most successful project to date—PLATINCOIN. PLATINCOIN is a global cryptosystem that includes more than 10 high-tech products and services. The audience of the company's product audience is more than 500,000 people around the world, and every day there are more and more users.

The main goal of all PLATINCOIN products is to make cryptocurrencies accessible to every user in the world and give people a simple tool to enter the financial market, which today is more than 2 billion people are deprived of.

David A. Marcus

Libra director, and the former president of PayPal

Age: 46 years old

David Marcus is an American entrepreneur born in Paris. Since April 2012, David has been the director of PayPal. In August 2014, he became the vice-president of messaging products at Facebook where he heads the Facebook Messenger unit. In parallel with his work on Facebook, David actively studied blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and in 2017 became a member of the board of directors of the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. Since 2018, David has been responsible for the Facebook blockchain business, and since June 2019 he has headed the Calibra project.

Calibra or Libra is a new cryptocurrency developed by Facebook and other companies. Libra is perhaps one of the most controversial blockchain projects, and opinions are divided about it. On the one hand, some sees the Facebook initiative as a threat to the anonymity and decentralisation of the blockchain, whilst, on the other hand, others see it as the long-awaited breakthrough for the technology.

According to a white paper published in the summer, Libra is a global currency based on blockchain technology, the value of which is tied to a basket of real world currencies (for example, US dollar, euro, Japanese yen). The cost of Libra is equal to the weighted average exchange rate of these currencies. The initial issue of Libra is scheduled for this year in 2020.

Roger Ver

CEO of Bitcoin.com

Age: 40 years old

Roger Ver is a true crypto world legend. Known as the ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ for his promotion of Bitcoin, Roger made his first profit by buying and reselling hard drives on his summer school holidays. The business grew, and in 1999, Ver launched an online personal computer accessory shop, which he still runs to this day.

When Roger Ver found out about Bitcoin in 2011, he started investing heavily in technology and also began conducting educational activities. He posted advertisements on roadside billboards and posted them on the Internet, he lectured to schoolchildren and distributed free tokens. It was then that he earned the title of the ‘Bitcoin Jesus’.

Ver is quite the colourful character, and between these two stages of his life, Ver spent 10 years in prison for illegally selling explosives, ran for the California State Assembly from the Libertarian Party, left the US for Japan, and renounced US citizenship.

In the crypto community, Roger Ver is known as an ardent supporter of Bitcoin Cash: one of the famous forks of Bitcoin. Right after the spinoff, Roger announced that this digital asset was developing exactly along the path that was originally intended for Bitcoin. His main bugbear with Bitcoin is what he claims is its too small block size and his gripe with the low transaction speed.

And remember, cryptocurrency: ‘It’s money 2.0, a huge, huge, huge deal.’ —Chamath Palihapitiya, venture capitalist","40 Banks in Germany Declare Intent to Offer Crypto Services Under New Law

More than 40 financial institutions in Germany have reportedly declared to the country’s financial regulator, BaFin, their interest to offer cryptocurrency services under the new German law. News.Bitcoin.com reached out to the regulator for some more information. The law, which went into effect early this year, enables banks to offer crypto services after obtaining a license from BaFin.

Declaration Submitted by 40 Financial Institutions

BaFin has received more than 40 “expressions of interest” from banks for approval to operate a crypto custody business in the future, German publication Handelsblatt reported Monday.

News.Bitcoin.com reached out to BaFin for more details. A spokesperson for the regulator clarified that expressions of interest are not applications for permission. He explained that even before the new law came into force, BaFin had asked companies that were already providing crypto custody services and are therefore subject to BaFin’s mandatory authorization to submit informal, non-binding expressions of interest. The spokesperson, however, would not comment on the number of banks that have submitted this expression of interest.

The new German Money Laundering Act which went into effect at the beginning of the year allows financial institutions to offer their customers cryptocurrencies alongside traditional investment products, such as stocks and bonds.

Expressions of Interest to Offer Crypto Services

BaFin explained that companies will not receive an immediate acknowledgment of receipt or an assessment of the information submitted on their expression of interest. This voluntary action does not replace the formal notification of intent pursuant to Section 64y KWG, the regulator noted, adding:

The law implementing the amendment to the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive … came into force on January 1, 2020 … These companies are therefore subject to money laundering law from 01.01.2020 regardless of the time of submitting the notification of intent.

Solarisbank

One of the first financial institutions to offer cryptocurrency services is Solarisbank in Berlin. The bank launched a subsidiary, Solaris Digital Assets, in December last year to drive the adoption of digital assets. “As a subsidiary of Solarisbank AG, Solaris Digital Assets plans to fulfill the regulatory requirements of the German market and ensure the compliant storage of digital assets, so that partners do not have to apply for a license themselves,” the company affirmed at the time. In the event of a successful application for a custody license from BaFin, the bank plans to store bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on behalf of the customer, Handelsblatt conveyed.

Solarisbank has a full banking license and has been providing services to numerous German fintech startups. “Digital assets will fundamentally change the financial market,” Michael Offermann, Managing Director for crypto banking activities at Solarisbank, told the news outlet. “As soon as it becomes easier to buy and store bitcoin … we expect strong growth.” He elaborated:

We have been dealing intensively with the topic of crypto custody for a year and a half … The new regulation in the new Money Laundering Act is a good time to start practically. After all, we are not a research institute, but a commercial bank.

The reshuffling would “create new efficiencies” in the Secret Service’s investigation of criminal acts involving cryptocurrencies and the financial marketplace, the executive report reads. It will also give Treasury more fire power to, as the budget reads, “disrupt terrorist financing, hold rogue states and human rights abusers accountable, and detect and deter financial crimes.”

The Secret Service is better known for protecting U.S. presidents and their families, but it is also responsible for investigating a wide range of financial crimes including fraud and counterfeiting, among others.

“Technological advancements in recent decades, such as cryptocurrencies and the increasing interconnectedness of the international financial marketplace, have resulted in more complex criminal organizations and revealed stronger links between financial and electronic crimes and the financing of terrorists and rogue state actors,” according to the document.

That may be why the people behind the budget think the Secret Service, the sole office charged with the protection of U.S. currency, could give a major boost to Treasury’s cyber crime-fighting efforts.

At Treasury, the Secret Service’s cryptocurrency investigations could dovetail with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a money-laundering watchdog that monitors cryptocurrency-related violations of the Banking Secrecy Act.

DHS, the Secret Service and branches within the Treasury Department have already spent millions of dollars on blockchain analytics, tapping Chainalysis to provide software tools and services.","Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation has indicated it won’t be creating regulations for the crypto mining sector.

In a document published on Friday, the government branch responsible for the digitization of Ukraine’s economy listed the main principles of the country’s approach to the crypto assets.

The main goals for the government in the field should be “formation and implementation of state policy in the field of digitization, digital economy, digital innovation, e-governance and e-democracy, development of information society; assuring the development of virtual assets, blockchain and tokenization, artificial intelligence,” the document reads.

Most notably, the ministry said it has no plans to bring in rules to regulate crypto mining as that industry is already self-governed by blockchain consensus rules.

“We remain loyal to mining activities that form part of open decentralized networks. Mining does not require regulatory activity from governmental oversight bodies or other third-party regulations, this activity is regulated by the protocol itself and network members,” the manifesto states.

The ministry will also “contribute to the development and market introduction” of distributed ledgers, support “any innovation using these digital technologies, even if they are partially unregulated and/or not defined by national law” and create regulatory sandboxes for the blockchain industry.

The government will further seek to adopt the world’s best practices when it comes to taxing cryptocurrency-related income. A draft bill on taxation was submitted to the country’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, in November.

In addition, the manifesto says, Ukraine aims to facilitate the interaction between the traditional finance and crypto markets and prevent misconduct by service providers and law enforcement agencies.","(Reuters) - On Feb. 19, U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel of Manhattan will hear competing motions for summary judgment in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s most significant enforcement action to date against a blockchain developer. The SEC will argue that entrepreneurs from the encrypted messaging app Telegram breached securities laws when they raised nearly $2 billion to develop a new blockchain platform. Telegram will counter that it wasn’t required to register its offering – and that the cryptocurrency tokens investors will receive are not in the SEC’s purview. Blockchain industry groups, as I told you last month, filed amicus briefs in the case, pleading with the SEC to provide clearer regulations for digital assets and to set out a better-defined path to launch blockchains.

It turns out that at least one SEC commissioner agrees with a lot of what Telegram and its backers have said.

""The SEC’s approach in these cases has made it extremely difficult for a company to distribute a token without running into a charge that the company is engaged in a securities offering,"" the commissioner said.

Peirce proposed a new enforcement regime in which the SEC would grant network developers a three-year safe harbor to establish active, decentralized trading of their cryptocurrency tokens, according to a written version of the speech. Peirce’s plan would allow developers to raise capital by offering tokens to investors and would permit secondary transactions without treating the tokens as securities – exactly the rules that Telegram and the blockchain industry groups are pushing in the case before Judge Castel.

Commissioner Peirce did not mention the Telegram case in her speech, but Telegram’s lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom certainly took note of what she said. On Thursday, Telegram filed a letter to Judge Castel, alerting him about the speech and hinting that Peirce’s comments will figure in the company’s defense.

An SEC spokeswoman and Telegram counsel Alexander Drylewski of Skadden declined to comment on what impact, if any, Commissioner Peirce’s comments will have at next week’s hearing. But Judge Castel is clearly mulling the appropriate regulation of cryptocurrency: In an order issued last Thursday, he invited the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to opine on its role. Telegram has argued that cryptocurrency tokens should be regarded as commodities subject to CFTC regulation, rather than securities under the SEC’s jurisdiction.

It’s easier to understand the issues at stake in the Telegram case when you know some of the facts. Telegram’s founders believed they could develop a blockchain network that would be faster and more secure than Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose currencies have become so widely circulated that the SEC doesn’t regard them as securities. To build the network, Telegram conducted two private offerings to sophisticated institutional investors, raising $1.7 billion. In exchange, investors were slated to receive 2.9 billion digital tokens, known as Grams, that would eventually be used on the Telegram platform.

Telegram acknowledged that the contracts it offered to investors were securities, but it contended that its private placement was exempt from the SEC’s registration requirements. The company believes that Grams themselves are not securities. The whole point of the Telegram blockchain network, according to the company’s motion for summary judgment, is to create a new, widely circulated and decentralized digital currency that will function, like every currency, as a medium of exchange. Telegram said it has strived to reassure the SEC that Grams are not securities but has been stymied by the commission’s ill-defined standards for digital assets.

The SEC, meanwhile, sued Telegram in October to halt the launch of the blockchain platform before Grams could begin trading. According to the commission’s summary judgment brief, Grams can’t be disentangled from the investment contracts between Telegram and its investors. Under the U.S. Supreme Court’s definition of a security in 1946’s SEC v. Howey, the digital currency is a securities, like a stock certificate. So every transaction involving a Gram, in the SEC’s view, is subject to securities laws and must be conducted by a broker.

The two sides disagree on whether Telegram truly intends Grams to be so widely traded that the company and its investors won’t retain control of the market. The SEC said that Telegram planned to retain about 2 billion Grams, which would give the company the ability to affect the tokens’ market value. Telegram has said that its goal is an independent market and that it’s willing to assuage the SEC’s concerns. In fact, Telegram contends, it tried to work with the SEC in advance of its anticipated platform launch, but instead of providing guidance, the commission sued. (The SEC has said that Telegram only started talking to the commission after the SEC began investigating Telegram’s private offering.)

A centerpiece of the preliminary injunction hearing next week will be whether the SEC has provided clear rules for blockchain developers. Telegram has asserted an affirmative defense that the SEC’s view of digital assets is so imprecise that the company did not have constitutionally sufficient notice that its offering and anticipated launch of Grams trading was problematic. The SEC has moved to strike that defense, pointing to evidence that Telegram tinkered with its plans to avoid triggering securities laws.

Commissioner Peirce most definitely didn’t say the SEC’s guidance is unconstitutionally vague, but she did say that the commission’s rules are very difficult for legitimate entrepreneurs to navigate. “When we see people struggling to find a way both to comply with the law and accomplish their laudable objectives, we need to ask ourselves whether the law should change to enable them to pursue their efforts in confidence that they are doing so legally,” Peirce said in last week’s speech. She highlighted criticism that the SEC has “elided the distinction” between investment contracts to raise the capital to create a cryptocurrency network and the token that will subsequently trade through the network, citing the “disastrous consequences” when the SEC conflates tokens and investment contracts. That is precisely the argument that Telegram is advancing.

Obviously, Peirce is just one SEC commissioner and her proposed safe harbor for cryptocurrencies is still just an idea. Even if the SEC eventually adopts a version of Commissioner Peirce’s three-year pause on enforcement against blockchain developers that satisfy conditions intended to protect investors, it will be too late for Telegram, which is hoping to persuade Judge Castel to allow its platform to launch right away. But I have no doubt that Peirce’s speech will crop up at next week’s hearing. It’s not every day, after all, that an SEC commissioner essentially echoes the arguments of an SEC enforcement target.","TLDR: It doesn’t matter because tokenization on BSV is the future.

Economic reality is starting to catch up to digital asset exchanges that continue to refuse to list Bitcoin SV (BSV). Bitcoin has defied those who colluded to kill it, becoming the fifth highest such asset by market cap in January 2020, third largest by market cap after removing Ripple which isn’t even a public blockchain and Ethereum which was pre-mined and is now moving to Proof of Stake. “List or die,” wrote Bitcoin investor Calvin Ayre, signaling the market would eventually punish those who willfully refuse to acknowledge BSV’s value.

Cryptocurrency exchange customers will increasingly demand to know why they can’t either trade BSV or claim BSV ownership from their pre-fork BTC or BCH balances. Should exchanges continue to refuse, they may face a reputational or legal backlash.

Not only is BSV the globally dominant platform in the world for all types of utility, its also the market leader for capital gains so far this year and predicted to also be for the rest of the year and its 3rd in the world for market cap for real public blockchains. List or die. — Calvin Ayre (@CalvinAyre) February 8, 2020

But it’s about far more than listing a single asset. With the activation of Bitcoin v1.0.0, or “Genesis” at the start of February 2020, Bitcoin gained full power for use as a platform for tokenization. Should projects begin to build legal and tradeable digital tokens on a platform that actually scales, Bitcoin will present serious competition to today’s popular platforms like Ethereum and EOS.

If (or more like when) that starts to happen, continued refusal to list BSV will disappoint far more customers than just BSV traders. Will today’s exchanges change their course, or will they be replaced by a new, more legally compliant, breed?

A few days ago, we looked at the decisions of exchanges like Binance, Kraken and ShapeShift to “delist BSV” in 2019. There were also others that never listed BSV at all, but were happy to snatch the coins themselves after the blockchain forks while denying their customers any access to them.

When these exchanges delisted Bitcoin BSV nearly a year ago, they expected the sharp drop in active price speculators would crash the price and eventually kill the coin. While there was an initial price drop, the longer-term strategy didn’t work: not only is the BSV price now higher than it was in April 2019, it’s the #5 digital asset by market cap on popular trading data sites. At one point, its market cap surpassed BCH.

The exchanges that scorned BSV have put themselves in a difficult position. Should BSV achieve its stated goals, traders will want to know why it isn’t listed on the exchanges they use. The exchanges will need to address their concerns somehow, or risk losing valuable customers to other platforms. A thriving market for tokens based on BSV smart contracts will only exacerbate their woes, by creating an economy that potentially far exceeds Bitcoin’s market cap.

What token trading really should be

BSV proposes a different kind of token model. Unlike the shady “ICO” model of the past few years, tokens would represent actual legal assets, including company shares, national currencies, or ownership of any other valuable asset. Their value won’t be speculative, but based on the real market value of the underlying assets they represent.

That’s how Bitcoin BSV sees token trading in the future. Exchanges wishing to trade these digital assets will need to act responsibly and ethically, as will the token-based projects they list. There will be increased scrutiny from authorities like the SEC and CFTC—good news and potentially large profits for exchanges that follow the law, but bad news for those who wish to continue acting as “bucket shops” or unregulated casinos. Regulators are unlikely to look favorably at exchanges who colluded to destroy the market value of their users’ assets.

Whether the exchanges mentioned above delisted BSV based on ideology or for business/financial reasons, as of 2020 their decisions have backfired. It’s not too late for them to change their ways, even if they have to eat some humble pie in the process.

Altsbit – a platform reported to be based in Italy, though it doesn’t make this clear on its website or social media – announced the breach last Thursday, stating on Twitter: “Unfortunately we have to notify you with the fact that our exchange was hacked during the night and almost all funds from BTC, ETH, ARRR and VRSC were stolen. A small part of the funds are safe on cold wallets.”

An update on the company’s website now indicates that “fortunately a good part of the coins were kept on cold storage” and that it will issue partial refunds, not having the wherewithal to fully compensate users.

The cryptocurrencies taken in the hack are now listed as:

Bitcoin (BTC): 6,929 lost out of 14,782 held

Ether (ETH): 23,210 lost out of 32,262

Pirate Chain (ARRR): 3,924,082 lost out of 9,619,754

Verus Coin (VRSC): 414,154 lost out of 852,726

Komodo (KMD): 1,066 lost out of 48,015

The site said users who saw losses must apply for their partial refunds. The bitcoin and ether stolen were valued at around $72.5 million at press time.

Customers of the exchange will need to get their applications in quickly, with exchange saying: “Refunds will begin on February 10, 2020, and end on May 8, 2020; after this date it will no longer be possible to request a refund as the Altsbit platform will be terminated.”

Black-hat hacking group LulzSec appears to have claimed responsibility for the theft on its Twitter feed, saying: “We assure that @altsbit didn’t had (sic) proper security to stop Lulz Canon. Many others to follow. Better Stack up the Security – Note to other Exchanges.”

The group, a number of whose members have been arrested, has been linked to previous major hacks including one of Sony Pictures in 2011.

Altsbit had only launched as a rebranded service (though it’s not clear what it had rebranded from) in October, offering a “roadmap” that comprised a brief list of objectives with “Adding user security functions” coming in last as item number five."
