minute. In the last decade, the best investment you could make was Bitcoin, provided you jumped into the boat relatively early. Some were even able to ride the recent wave of miners that bought each and every capable graphics card on the market hoping to make a profit. Now you'd have to own a large mining operation with specialized equipment somewhere in a cold climate or in places like China where electricity cost is just a few cents per kWh.\n","\n","Companies like Starbucks and AT&T are slowly adopting Bitcoin as a payment method, while others like Apple might never integrate it into their services. Some would be quick to dismiss it based on how transactions are very slow and not at all energy efficient, but solutions backed by tech executives like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey are on the way to solve that in the near future.\n","\n","When that happens, there is a good chance the value of Bitcoin will rise, as it has the potential to offer inexpensive financial services for the 1.2 billion people in places like Africa who can't rely on the banking system.\n","\n","Governments don't like the idea of highly volatile and speculative assets like Bitcoin, but they are much more open to the idea of currency-pegged \"stablecoins.\" After the 2020 halving, much of the effort that was previously devoted to mining will have to be directed towards greater adoption, so at least there's a low chance we'll see Bitcoin go down in price.\n","\n","In any case, expect more companies to follow in the footsteps of Facebook to launch their own cryptocurrencies, which is also known to cause surges in Bitcoin's price as soon as an announcement is made. If anything, 2020 might be the year cryptocurrency hits the mainstream and governments start to take it more seriously.\n","https://cryptobriefing.com/maker-dominates-defi-competitors-emerging/\n","https://cryptobriefing.com/maker-dominates-defi-competitors-emerging/\n","['Paul De Havilland']\n","2020-01-28 19:15:56+00:00\n","Share this article\n","\n","Maker, the Ethereum-based DeFi protocol, remains dominant in decentralized finance, but competitors such as Compound and Synthetix showed strong growth in 2019.\n","\n","Maker Remains the King of DeFi\n","\n","MakerDAO, creator of “the world’s first unbiased currency” DAI, enjoyed first mover advantage in the burgeoning DeFi market. With almost $850 million worth of collateral locked in DeFi smart contracts, Maker dominance sits at 57% with almost half a billion dollars in total locked value. The DeFi market itself grew exponentially in 2019, up from just over $250 million since the beginning of last year.\n","\n","Maker’s dominance is even more pronounced in lending markets, where it powers 78% of total value locked. In the beginning of 2019, Maker was the only DeFi protocol to have locked in significant collateral.\n","\n","Competitors Emerge\n","\n","Over the course of last year, however, competitors emerged to take away some of Maker’s market share. The difference is stark. While MakerDAO began 2019 as the only DeFi player of any significance, by the end of the year, it shared the spotlight with a number of rivals.\n","\n","Most notably, Compound grew with the wider DeFi market, boasting six times the total value locked in U.S. dollar terms than it had at the start of the year. The Compound protocol currently has almost $150 million worth of assets locked in collateral, spanning eight different markets. Ether and Dai dominate Compound contracts, with around $65 and $24 million worth in its protocol, respectively.\n","\n","Uniswap, a token exchange protocol and liquidity pooling platform, grew its total locked value from $470 thousand to $50 million in 2019, representing 50X growth over the course of the year.\n","\n","Synthetix grew from less than $2 million to over $150 million in total locked value in the same period of time, to become the second largest player in the market. On the other hand, Maker’s single collateral and multi-collateral Dai have over two million Ether locked up in contracts, representing 16% growth for the year.\n","\n","With eight major lending protocols, a few of the more recent entrants saw staggering growth rates. According to DeFi Rate, Nuo Network grew by 66,000%, with bZx and InstaDApp both soaring by almost 30,000% in terms of value locked.\n","\n","Why Has the Landscape Changed so Dramatically?\n","\n","Maker continues to be the dominant force in DeFi, but it is no longer the only player. As the DeFi market exploded, room was created for competitors. DeFi in 2019 in many ways mirrors the explosion of growth of blockchain projects in 2017.\n","\n","One of the reasons for the surge in interest in decentralized finance are the high yields. Compared to more traditional assets, DAI and SAI have both seen yields expand to double digits. Those stability fees have been rare, but stablecoin yields in the DeFi market are ordinarily above five percent. Compared to low yielding traditional assets, DeFi contracts provide attractive returns for investors.\n","\n","The 2019 explosion of growth is probably the most significant reason for the rapid expansion of MakerDAO competitors. According to DeFi Rate, the entire market grew by almost 140% over the year, with the increase in locked DAI growing almost 1,000%.\n","\n","Derivatives surged by close to 5,000%, the fastest growing segment of the market. The growth in DeFi derivative products explains the success of Synthetix, a “crypto-backed synthetic asset platform that provides on-chain exposure to real-world currencies, commodities, stocks, and indices.”\n","\n","A year ago, one in every 56 Ether was locked in a DeFi protocol. That figure is now around 37. That hasn’t led to an increase in the price of Ether, which was down slightly for the year. The Ethereum network continues to grow in terms of activity, but its token price has not enjoyed a resultant uptick.\n","\n","The Future of DeFi\n","\n","With Bitcoin and Ethereum towering over the remaining 14 most active blockchains, Ethereum’s ecosystem appears healthy and vibrant. It hosts the fastest growing segment of the blockchain landscape in DeFi, but its price decoupled from the level of decentralized finance activity last year despite almost 3% of it being locked up in DeFi contracts.\n","\n","As the decentralized finance industry matures, it is unlikely to witness such significant rates of growth in the future. But given the emergence of a number of new players in the space in 2019, the makeup of the sector is likely to shift. Maker remains the most significant entity, but as in all areas of crypto, that could change rapidly.\n","\n","Keeping ahead of the curve and remaining innovative is important. The arrival of decentralized insurance protocol Nexus Mutual last year demonstrated that there is a lot of innovation to play out in the space. But user experience is beginning to be acknowledged as vital to a project’s success. If DeFi is to truly go mainstream, society stands to benefit immensely.\n","http://www.sjuhawknews.com/money-matters-investing-in-bitcoin/\n","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-28/bitcoin-jesus-caves-as-fight-over-fourth-biggest-coin-heats-up\n","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-28/bitcoin-jesus-caves-as-fight-over-fourth-biggest-coin-heats-up\n","[]\n","2020-01-28 00:00:00\n","Why did this happen?\n","\n","Please make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading.

Besides the eight previously discussed coins, we introduce two more interesting cases.\n","\n","The results were quite representative of the realistic situation, one may say, as four of the listed ten coins have strengthened up, while the defense of the rest has dwindled since April last year. It goes to show that this is another pricey element of the Cryptosphere that can change quickly and that there's no time to rest in keeping the defense up against it.\n","\n","As a reminder, a 51% attack happens when a person or a group gain the control of the majority of mining power on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain network, meaning that they can double-spend and reverse transactions, preventing other users from mining. It doesn't, however, allow the attackers to steal other's coins. While major distributed networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are safer due to their sheer size and are commonly a lot more expensive to attack, smaller networks have fewer participants and lack that layer of protection.\n","\n","Here's how the theoretical costs of one hour attack have changed for some of the PoW coins since April 2019:\n","\n","The 51% attack cost:\n","\n","December 2018: USD 275,613\n","\n","April 2019: USD 375,502\n","\n","January 2020: USD 682,993\n","\n","BTC price change in a year: +158%\n","\n","Market capitalization: USD 164.1 billion\n","\n","Bitcoin, standing at the top of the list, has made a major improvement of almost 82% since April, almost doubling the amount of money somebody would need to pay for an hour of attack, while NiceHash, a Slovenian cryptocurrency cloud mining marketplace, has but 1% of hash power to offer such a person. It's unknown if anybody could offer enough. A 51% attack is never impossible in theory, but the protection offered by the size of the network, and the price in combination with the lack of rentable hashing power, are a major deterrent in either case. Additionally, BTC is gearing up for the approaching halving in May. Meanwhile, two European mathematicians, Cyril Grunspan and Ricardo Pérez-Marco, calculated that double-spending an average BTC transaction is not profitable.\n","\n","The 51% attack cost:\n","\n","December 2018: USD 4,008\n","\n","April 2019: USD 6,317\n","\n","January 2020: USD 10,875\n","\n","ETC price change in a year: +160%\n","\n","Market capitalization: USD 1.2 billion\n","\n","ETC is another interesting case. Though it sits in second place, NiceHash can offer 36% of the needed hash power if a villain decides to go for an attack. Nonetheless, this is still far less than 72% we noted back in April, so the overall improvement is noticeable. As mentioned last time, ETC suffered a 51% attack in January 2019.\n","\n","The 51% attack cost:\n","\n","December 2018: USD 7,896\n","\n","April 2019: USD 22,322\n","\n","January 2020: USD 26,422\n","\n","BCH price change in a year: +221%\n","\n","Market capitalization: USD 6.7 billion\n","\n","Bitcoin Cash has been pushed down from the very top to the third place on the list. Though its improvement has been consistent since December 2018, it registered a 182% rise in April 2019, and then continued upwards at a slower pace since. NiceHash can offer 13% of the hashing power necessary for an attack, which is among the higher percentages on today's list, yet far from the highest.

That represents a steady rise in adoption since the pioneer cryptocurrency was invented.\n","\n","A Different Approach to Bitcoin\n","\n","Despite the public nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, the question of how many people are using the cryptocurrency has always been difficult to answer. Recent analysis from Glassnode, however, provides some valuable insights.\n","\n","Counting Bitcoin addresses has historically been the most commonly deployed approach to measuring Bitcoin users.\n","\n","That method is limited by the twin problems of Bitcoin addresses that hold multiple users’ funds, such as exchange addresses, and users who control more than one address.\n","\n","Lesser, more rudimentary methods based on educated guesses have also led to inconsistencies and inaccuracies when assessing the true number of users on the Bitcoin network.\n","\n","For their part, Glassnode has developed an approach that maps multiple addresses to singular entities, thus solving some of the discrepancies mentioned above.\n","\n","While they do not resolve the problem of exchange addresses, which hold Bitcoin for more than one person, their calculations paint a clear picture: Bitcoin usage is healthy and growing and always has been.\n","\n","Measuring Adoption by Entity\n","\n","By measuring new entities, former entities, and sending and receiving entities, the on-chain data and intelligence platform found that “as of January 2020 the number of entities holding Bitcoin is ~23.1 million.”\n","\n","Importantly, those figures are almost 20% less than the number of addresses.\n","\n","Glassnode found that the volatility observed when measuring addresses is not present when counting entities. That finding alone casts serious doubt on the viability of merely assessing Bitcoin usage by the number of addresses alone.\n","\n","As the graph shows, (non-zero) address volatility is more pronounced than entity volatility.\n","\n","In the bear market of 2018, for example, there was a clear spike leading up to it, followed by a severe drop off during the winter. That same pattern did not play out in the number of entities.\n","\n","Findings Suggest Solid Long-term Growth\n","\n","Bitcoin adoption, according to Glassnodes’ findings, has been consistently trending upwards for all of the cryptocurrency’s history. In fact, the analysts found that “there have been only 21 days so far in which the net entity growth was negative.”\n","\n","The analysis also found that the seven largest Bitcoin entities, which hold around 13% of the supply of Bitcoin, were all exchanges.\n","\n","These included Coinbase (983,800 BTC), Huobi (369,100 BTC), Binance (240,700 BTC), Bitfinex (214,600 BTC), Bitstamp (165,400 BTC), Kraken (132,100 BTC), and Bittrex (118,100 BTC).

It’s a platform for running an infinite variety of applications, called “smart contracts” or “distributed applications” (dApps). In fact, Ethereum aspires to be a worldwide computer capable of doing anything that a single, standalone computer can do, with two key differences: It’s everywhere, distributed all across the internet. And nobody owns it.\n","\n","That was the Ethereum dream. But then began the Ethereum nightmare — a traffic jam of epic dimensions.\n","\n","You see, due to Ethereum’s low capacity and slow speed — plus huge demand — the door was flung wide open to a host of wannabe Ethereum killers, all aspiring to replace it and become the new smart contract queen.\n","\n","And now the big news …\n","\n","The King Of Crypto Itself Could Become A Smart Contract Platform\n","\n","We're talking about Bitcoin.\n","\n","And we're referring to a new generation of Bitcoin developers that have appeared on the scene.\n","\n","They’re hell bent on harnessing Bitcoin's first-mover advantage to muscle in on Ethereum's smart contract turf.\n","\n","Their project is RSK (RBTC), and it has all the earmarks of becoming one of the toughest combatants in the smart contract war.\n","\n","To be clear, RSK isn’t a run-of-the-mill upgrade to the Bitcoin blockchain. It's a whole new blockchain, designed as a sidechain that’s entirely dedicated to running smart contracts.\n","\n","Think of a major highway strictly for moving (or storing) money. That’s Bitcoin. Then think of a parallel superhighway for doing everything else. That’s RSK. What about the miners? They’re the same as the Bitcoin miners. Plus, of course, it’s open to anyone with Internet access and a regular computer.\n","\n","The major difference:\n","\n","Bitcoin miners earn block rewards paid in newly-created Bitcoin (BTC).\n","\n","RSK miners earn block rewards from fees earned from by RSK smart contract users. And they’re paid in RSK Bitcoins (RBTC).\n","\n","A key reason it works: The RBTC and BTC are freely exchangeable one-to-one, anytime. In effect, RBTC is simply a form of Bitcoin used for running smart contracts.\n","\n","Now, with this revolutionary change …\n","\n","Bitcoin Owners Can Run dApps\n","\n","Let’s say you’re among the millions who own Bitcoin.\n","\n","Until now, all you could do is transfer it, spend it or hoard it.\n","\n","But with the advent of RSK, all that changes. For the first time since Bitcoin was born, you can run Distributed Applications.\n","\n","Or, let’s say you’re a Bitcoin developer. Without RSK, the things you could do were very narrowly confined. Now, you can use Bitcoin to build a myriad of applications.\n","\n","Given the sheer size and volume of the Bitcoin network, we have little doubt RSK is going to be a hit.\n","\n","And Decentralized Finance developers could be among the first to switch.\n","\n","Why switch?\n","\n","First, because RSK and Ethereum code have a lot in common. Some might say they’re virtually the same. So with RSK, anything currently running on Ethereum should run equally well on Bitcoin. It’s a relatively easy move.\n","\n","Second, because of the collateral. Right now, DeFi apps that run on Ethereum use ETH for collateral. If they switch to Bitcoin, they will use BTC. Given the security, stability and size of Bitcoin, that’s a big advantage.\n","\n","Right now, for example, a major Ethereum-project is DAI, a stablecoin with the potential to disrupt the way money works. DAI is currently backed by ETH, which most people know much less about. Imagine if it’s backed by the widely known (and owned) Bitcoin instead!\n","\n","And think about what Bitcoin RSK could do for a peer-to-peer lending and borrowing platforms. If they switch to Bitcoin, they have the potential to gain almost instant credibility, greatly enhancing their chances for success.\n","\n","End result. Someday, Bitcoin could emerge from its current, limited-use cases (mostly a store of value), and become the fuel for running smart contracts in what’s bound to become a fuel-thirsty market.\n","\n","Check out Weiss Crypto Ratings and Indexes:\n","\n","https://www.benzinga.com/cryptocurrency/weiss-crypto-ratings/\n","\n","https://www.benzinga.com/cryptocurrency/weiss-crypto-indexes/\n","\n","Image Sourced from Pixabay\n","https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/54312/another-swiss-town-now-accepts-bitcoin-for-tax-payments\n","https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/54312/another-swiss-town-now-accepts-bitcoin-for-tax-payments\n","[]\n","None\n","The Swiss municipality of Zermatt now lets residents pay their taxes in bitcoin.\n","\n","The new payment option is being offered via crypto financial services firm Bitcoin Suisse, according to an announcement Wednesday.

Do they represent a threat or are they an opportunity for Bitcoin and major altcoins to gain more traction and adoption?\n","\n","Let’s take a look below.\n","\n","Central bank digital currencies on the rise\n","\n","The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) released a report a few days ago stating CBDCs are undergoing serious consideration by a great deal of central banks (CBs) around the world. The researchers concluded that:\n","\n","“Globally, emerging market economies are moving from conceptual research to intensive practical development, driven by stronger motivations than those of advanced economy central banks. Central banks representing a fifth of the world’s population say they are likely to issue the first CBDCs in the next few years.”\n","\n","It seems one of the most heated topics of 2020 will be the development of CDBCs as crypto enthusiasts fear their impact on cryptocurrencies.\n","\n","On one hand, CBDCs could help spread digital cash to the unbanked, but they may also pose a threat to peer-to-peer, permissionless, and decentralised cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n","\n","For one, with the spread of digital cash backed by the government, physical cash will most likely disappear. In addition, users will need permission to use central bank digital currencies, so privacy will surely be affected.\n","\n","Another issue is the impact CBDCs will have on fiat-to-cryptocurrency gateway coins.\n","\n","Could central banks simply block the use of cryptocurrencies?\n","\n","Do CBDCs pose a threat?\n","\n","As an example of a potential issue that could arise with the use of CBDCs, let’s take a look at China’s credit score system.\n","\n","I’ve discussed a similar issue here. Essentially, if enough points are subtracted off your credit score using the digital review system, you may lose the ability to trade with other individuals or travel to other locations.\n","\n","Individuals in China are therefore intertwined with their credit score. This means that one unlucky move or word and you may find yourself blocked from interacting with your community.\n","\n","How easy would it be for governments worldwide to adopt similar measures by implementing CBDCs?\n","\n","It’s pretty straightforward in my opinion. As such, I’d argue that CBDCs are indeed a threat – not only to cryptocurrencies, but to individuals’ sovereignty as well.\n","\n","CBDCs and crypto\n","\n","One way to combat this of course is to hedge with cryptocurrencies. That way, if a centralised third party does decide it wants to control your funds, you at least won’t be completely cut off.\n","\n","In my humble opinion, hedging against any government is (mostly) a smart move, especially in countries facing extreme hyperinflation.\n","\n","Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top altcoins may help you secure and store value in the long term.\n","\n","If there’s one thing CBDCs aren’t it’s cryptocurrency. As such, I believe it makes sense to possess unrelated assets in case there’s a storm.\n","\n","Safe trades!\n","https://www.chicagotribune.com/featured/sns-nyt-bitcoin-illegal-transactions-criminals-20200129-6wrf5dzsjzdlxcgo4c5c64qxqy-story.html\n","https://www.chicagotribune.com/featured/sns-nyt-bitcoin-illegal-transactions-criminals-20200129-6wrf5dzsjzdlxcgo4c5c64qxqy-story.html\n","['Nathaniel Popper']\n","None\n","Bitcoin prices and trading did spike in the middle of last year, soon after Facebook announced its intention to create the Libra cryptocurrency.

While bitcoin did see a minor pullback to $8.870 during the U.S. trading hours, the dip only ended up recharging the bulls for a strong move higher.\n","\n","The positive marubozu candle indicates that bullish sentiment is strong – more so, in this case, as it shows buyers stepped without any hesitation despite prices trading close to 200-day MA, which acted as stiff resistance on Jan. 19.\n","\n","Some investors may point out that bitcoin’s break above the 200-day MA in October turned out to be a bull trap. But back then the overall market sentiment was bearish, with the cryptocurrency trapped in a bearish channel on the weekly chart.\n","\n","Overall, the broader trend is bullish, as noted. The stage now looks set for a quick move into five figures. Pullbacks cannot be ruled out, though, and the case for a quick rise to $10,000 would weaken if prices fall back below the 200-day MA at $8,894 on the back of a spike in trading volumes.\n","\n","The weekly chart will continue to paint a bullish picture as long as prices are holding above $8,000.\n","01/30/2020\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&tbm=nws&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/30/2020,cd_max:01/30/2020,sbd:1&sa=X&hl=en&gl=us&as_drrb=b&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&gbv=1&sei=JtqhYLfQHov0tAbcvYOwAw\n","None\n","https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/181196?hl=en\n","None\n","https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3-9fX2s_wAhULOs0KHdzeADYQPAgI\n","#\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3-9fX2s_wAhULOs0KHdzeADYQ_AUIDigA\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/30/2020,cd_max:01/30/2020,sbd:1&tbm=bks&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3-9fX2s_wAhULOs0KHdzeADYQ_AUIECgC\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/30/2020,cd_max:01/30/2020&tbm=vid&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3-9fX2s_wAhULOs0KHdzeADYQ_AUIESgD\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/30/2020,cd_max:01/30/2020&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3-9fX2s_wAhULOs0KHdzeADYQ_AUIEigE\n","/preferences\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-using-bitcoin-beginner/\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-using-bitcoin-beginner/\n","[]\n","2020-01-30 10:00:27+00:00\n","How To Start Using Bitcoin: Buying, Storing, and Spending Crypto\n","\n","For the already initiated, there is a little spoken of land outside of crypto world where legions of normal people hear about Bitcoin and are interested, but don’t know where to begin. This is a problem considering the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed it as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system for anyone to use. Now that Bitcoin is in the news daily, and businesses and banks around the world are adopting the tech that supports it, it seems high time to better assist those interested in diving in.\n","\n","Also Read: How Is Bitcoin Cash Different From Bitcoin Core?\n","\n","What Is a Bitcoin?\n","\n","With well over 5,000 different cryptocurrencies currently in existence, someone new to the scene might understandably be taken aback or even put off by the overwhelming amount of info surrounding digital assets. Luckily, the most popular cryptos aren’t so numerous, and the one that started it all, Bitcoin, is the focus of this article.\n","\n","A breakdown of what Bitcoin is in simplest terms can be found in this resource from Bitcoin.com which states: “Bitcoin is a new type of digital money and, just like with all money, you can store it, exchange it, and make payments with it. However, unlike with traditional (fiat) currencies where payments are controlled by central banks, Bitcoin puts you in full control of your own money.”\n","\n","The reason the holder of bitcoin is in control is thanks to a decentralized system that depends on math and open source code — not politicians, central servers or banks — to record, secure and enable transactions. When you have the private keys to your coins, nobody can take them. This is in stark contrast to a system like Paypal’s, for example, where the company can decide to withhold your funds or cancel a payment at will, with or without consent from the user.\n","\n","Getting, Storing, and Spending Coins\n","\n","The first step to getting into Bitcoin is having a basic understanding of what it is and what it can do. The second is to get your hands on some of it. As there are a couple “branches” of bitcoin (created by chain splits called forks) it is important to be familiar with the differences. For the purposes of this guide, however, the focus will be on Bitcoin Cash (BCH), referred to hereafter just as bitcoin, as it most closely adheres to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\n","\n","Getting and Securing a Wallet\n","\n","Like traditional money, bitcoin must be stored somewhere, and requires a wallet. Crypto wallets are of course different from physical wallets that hold paper money and coins, but the concept is basically the same. There are mobile wallets and desktop wallets, as well as another variety called “cold storage.” It is highly important to make sure a wallet is non-custodial, meaning the user is in complete control of the funds, and not the wallet provider.\n","\n","Once a newcomer to the crypto world has downloaded a non-custodial wallet, they’ll need to secure it. This is primarily done by backing up, writing down, or otherwise safely storing what is called a “seed phrase” or recovery phrase. A seed phrase is a string of words that can be used to restore your wallet if it is ever lost, and can be revealed in a wallet’s options or settings menu.\n","\n","Let’s say someone takes their phone into the bathroom and drops the device into the toilet. Though the phone might be ruined, it doesn’t mean the bitcoin in the phone has been flushed. Once the person gets a new phone, they simply download the app again, and use the seed phrase to restore the wallet, complete with funds. The beauty of bitcoin is that the money is recorded on a distributed, encrypted ledger secured by multiple parties (blockchain), so the loss of one device doesn’t mean the loss of one’s cash.\n","\n","Once a seed phrase is safely stored out of sight and in a secure place, the wallet should be locked so that a pin, password or fingerprint is required to open it. This is highly important as someone could pick up the phone and freely spend bitcoins if the phone and wallet are left unattended and unlocked.\n","\n","Loading up on Bitcoin\n","\n","A bitcoin neophyte can now begin loading their wallet with satoshis – the name for the smallest unit of bitcoin. There are several ways to acquire bitcoin. It can be purchased with a credit card, bought on an exchange, traded for privately, or even picked up in small amounts for free, via what is called a bitcoin faucet.\n","\n","Crypto wallets send and receive money by way of bitcoin addresses. These are strings of characters that signify a wallet’s identity. A user’s public address can be shared with anyone in order to receive funds, and can also be represented as a QR code for easy transactions.\n","\n","For example, in acquiring bitcoin via the Bitcoin Cash Faucet, the user is prompted in the final step to provide their bitcoin address. A good, reliable wallet will clearly show a user’s address when the “receive” or similar button is tapped in their wallet.\n","\n","Every option for acquiring bitcoin mentioned above will require a wallet and an address. The video below demonstrates how QR code addresses are used to receive bitcoin as a shop owner in Venezuela accepts BCH from a customer:\n","\n","A small grocery store started accepting Bitcoin Cash in Maracaibo, Venezuela.

Whether it is travel, charity, food, clothes, gift cards or anything in between, bitcoin can be used to get the job done. The Bitcoin Cash Map is a handy app that will show brick and mortar stores accepting bitcoin in your area.\n","\n","The spending process is as easy as receiving. All that is needed is a merchant or other receiver’s address (in the form of a character string or QR code), and a tap or swipe of the send button after verifying the amount is correct. What’s more, crypto wallets keep track of your transactions for you, making record keeping and monitoring balances easy.\n","\n","A lot of newbies to the exciting world of crypto start out by sending tiny amounts to a friend, or even to themselves via another wallet, just to get comfortable with the process. This can be a fun way to get a real feel for how bitcoin works. Though some crypto OGs, influencers, and talking heads on Twitter might seem aloof and out of reach on account of their next-level geekiness, it’s important to remember that they too were once new to crypto. As Bitcoin continues its rapid evolution from niche tech to peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world, you may just find yourself a “bitcoin OG” sooner than you think.\n","\n","What got you interested in Bitcoin?

The various types of scams include fake token sales, blackmail scams, and fake services that promise to “mix” a user’s coins with those of others in order to make transactions harder to trace—only to run off with the money instead.\n","\n","Predation by Ponzi: But according to the new report, Ponzi schemes are the elephant in the room. These scams, which entice unwitting people to invest in a phony enterprise and then dole out profits to earlier investors using the money that more recent investors have contributed, accounted for 92% of the stolen funds. Millions of people were defrauded.\n","\n","The PlusToken fiasco: Chainalysis reports that a single Ponzi scheme based in China by itself brought in at least $2 billion last year, which would make it one of the biggest ever. PlusToken was a supposed cryptocurrency wallet service that promised users high returns if they used Bitcoin or Ethereum to buy the fake company’s own token, called Plus. An elaborate marketing campaign convinced more than three million people—the majority of whom were in China, Korea, and Japan—to invest by reaching them through the popular messaging platform WeChat, holding in-person meetups, and posting ads in supermarkets.\n","\n","In June, Chinese authorities arrested six people alleged to have been behind the scam, but it appears that at least one still hasn’t been caught, since someone has continued to launder the funds and even cash some of them out.\n","\n","Dirty laundry: Chainalysis says the PlusToken scammers have managed to cash out at least $185 million of stolen Bitcoin, but first they tried to cover their tracks by making 24,000 transfers and using 71,000 different Bitcoin addresses. Many of those transactions were executed via a special kind of wallet that uses a Bitcoin-compatible privacy technology called CoinJoin to combine the user’s transactions with others in a way that makes it difficult to tell who sent which payment to which recipient. Much of this money eventually found its way to so-called over-the-counter (OTC) brokers, independent entities that facilitate trades between individuals who don’t want to interact with a regulated exchange.\n","\n","The PlusToken scammers weren’t the only criminals who took this route. Chainalysis concludes that the activity of a small subset of “rogue” OTC brokers providing crypto-money-laundering services “skyrocketed” in 2019. The authors warn: “Regulators need to be aware of how these scams function and how players like OTC brokers fit in so that they can craft more effective consumer protection laws.” In the meantime, keep your guard up.\n","\n","Keep up with the fast-moving and sometimes baffling world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains with our weekly newsletter Chain Letter.

Yet, in the white-hot cryptocurrency industry, lenders are burgeoning.\n","\n","The Commerce Department reported Thursday that U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.1 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, on par with the third quarter’s clip, even after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times earlier in 2019 to stimulate growth. For the full year, the economy expanded 2.3 percent, a slowdown from 2018’s 2.9 percent, according to the report.\n","\n","If there’s any softening in the economy, it hasn’t been felt by lenders like Genesis. The New York-based trading firm that lends cash alongside cryptocurrencies like bitcoin said Thursday in a report that loans increased by 21 percent during the fourth quarter to $545 million, driven by demand from big investors as well as aggregators of smaller loans in Asia and Europe.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","Such growth was more than 10 times the pace at New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, where loan balances increased by 2 percent – roughly the same pace as the economy – during the period to $959.8 billion.\n","\n","Only a few lenders can be found in the decade-old digital asset industry, and they are starting from a smaller base. There’s also a dearth of competition from established banks for loans to crypto traders and businesses, due to conservative risk-management policies and restrictions imposed by regulators. Since a cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be a highly volatile collateral for loans, more traditional lenders are rare.\n","\n","But crypto lenders are seeing strong demand from borrowers who want loans denominated in bitcoin, cash or “stablecoins” – digital tokens like tether and USD Coin whose price is linked to the U.S. dollar or other government-issued currencies. And there are plenty of investors willing to pledge cash to lenders like Genesis in exchange for interest rates of 7 or 8 percent.\n","\n","BlockFi, a big crypto lender backed by the investment funds Galaxy Digital and Winklevoss Capital, said earlier this month it planned to add five to 10 new assets to its platform, including the cryptocurrency litecoin and a dollar-pegged digital token, USD Coin. Later this year BlockFi plans to launch a credit card that offers rewards in bitcoin.\n","\n","Celsius Network, another crypto lender, said in December large institutional clients were becoming an increasingly key contributor to the platform’s loan growth.\n","\n","“Obviously the crypto sector is not even a beauty mark right now compared with the banking sector, in terms of the size and maturity,” Genesis CEO Michael Moro said in a phone interview. “But there is rapid growth in this new market, and it’s not just us. There are other companies trying to accomplish similar things.”\n","\n","Genesis is controlled by the crypto-focused investment firm Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.\n","\n","Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, surged 94 percent in 2019, more than three times the gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks over the period.\n","\n","So far in January, bitcoin is up another 30 percent to about $9,300, the best start to a year since 2013. Earlier this month, the professional-network website LinkedIn named blockchain – the cryptographically-enabled computer-network technology underpinning cryptocurrencies – as the most in-demand skill among employers.\n","\n","Silvergate Capital, one of the few banking companies serving crypto-related businesses, said Wednesday total assets were flat in the fourth quarter at $2.13 billion. But the La Jolla, California-based publicly traded company said it added 48 digital currency customers during the period, bringing the total to 804, while transactions on its digital Silvergate Exchange Network rose by 17 percent from third-quarter levels.\n","\n","A recently announced initiative at Silvergate will allow customers to obtain U.S. dollar-denominated loans collateralized by bitcoin.\n","\n","Genesis said in its latest report a new source of demand for cash loans in 2020 could come from “mining” companies that need capital to build, expand or upgrade data centers used to process transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.\n","https://www.coindesk.com/few-banks-will-touch-crypto-firms-but-silvergate-wants-to-touch-bitcoin-itself\n","https://www.coindesk.com/few-banks-will-touch-crypto-firms-but-silvergate-wants-to-touch-bitcoin-itself\n","[]\n","2020-01-30 22:00:15+00:00\n","Silvergate Bank is venturing even further into a field where few financial institutions dare to tiptoe.\n","\n","The La Jolla, Calif., lender made a name for itself providing hard-to-come-by U.S.-dollar banking services for businesses that deal in cryptocurrency. But now Silvergate wants to handle digital assets themselves.\n","\n","While the bank has no such services on its roadmap yet, it has applied for the New York trust license with the aim of providing custody and settlement for crypto. One example of this might look like “providing settlement services for their bitcoin trades,” Silvergate CEO Alan J. Lane said.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","In this scenario, Silvergate would be the intermediary ensuring settlement of a fiat-for-bitcoin exchange between two participants on its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a payments platform that allows commercial customers to instantly move U.S. dollars between crypto exchanges.\n","\n","“In order for us to be able to be that trusted intermediary, we have to be able to touch the digital assets ourselves,” Lane said. “Think about it as if Silvergate also had the ability to be the SEN for bitcoin.”\n","\n","The service, almost certainly the first of its kind offered by a U.S. commercial bank, wouldn’t apply to retail investors or institutional investors that are already comfortable with bitcoin as an asset class.\n","\n","“It’s folks that aren’t quite ready to be in the business, and part of the reason is because this doesn’t exist,” Lane said, emphasizing the bank doesn’t yet have a product in mind to solve the problem. “Our current customers, they’ve already figured out a way to get comfortable with this, but they tell us there are other counterparties out there that they’re not yet doing business with because they don’t have a trusted way to settle.”\n","\n","Lane spoke to CoinDesk Wednesday after Silvergate’s first conference call as a publicly traded company. Earlier in the day it had reported fourth-quarter results, including a 6 percent increase in crypto clients and a 4 percent decrease in deposits from those clients.\n","\n","Coming soon\n","\n","Silvergate Bank’s 2020 will be characterized by staff getting the bank’s bitcoin-collateralized margin lending running well and solving other pain points in the digital asset industry, Lane said.\n","\n","Salary expenses climbed nearly 6 percent from a year earlier to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter. The majority of this went toward customer service and software engineers, Lane said when asked what share of the expenses was from compliance costs.\n","\n","The bank does spend money on compliance, of course: Silvergate uses both Chainalysis and Elliptic, Lane said. These vendors analyze the public blockchains to flag suspicious activity, which banks are required under Federal Reserve regulations to report.\n","\n","With $2.1 billion in assets, Silvergate is a relatively small institution, 0.07 percent the size of JPMorgan. The asset side of its balance sheet looks like a traditional community lender, composed mainly of real estate loans. But that may start to evolve soon.\n","\n","In the immediate future, Silvergate’s biggest focus is its pilot of the SEN Leverage product, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans they can then use to buy more bitcoin.\n","\n","Since the 90-to-180-day pilot will include only SEN participants, the bank will be able to monitor SEN Leverage loans more closely than it could other types of loans.\n","\n","“We will be able to monitor the loan, the collateral underlying the loan and the balance of the loan, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Lane said. “We’ll be able to monitor this much more closely than we can monitor just about any other loan we make.”\n","\n","In response to questions from analysts in the company’s earnings call about yield on SEN loans, Lane said, “The way we’ve thought about this initially is this would likely be a high single-digit type of cost to the borrower.”\n","\n","In the interview, Lane emphasized the bank wouldn’t take advantage of crypto customers on SEN loans just because other banks aren’t offering the same product. “We’re certainly not going to poke their eyes out on what we’re charging them,” Lane said.\n","\n","Silvergate is also working to increase the number of fiat currencies it supports for foreign exchange transactions on the SEN to include at least the top five to 10 major global currencies. From fourth-quarter 2018 to fourth-quarter 2019, volume on the SEN increased by 150 percent to an all-time high of 14,400 transactions handling $9.6 billion.\n","\n","“Our customers are saying, ‘We’d love to have the SEN for the euro and the SEN for the yen,’” Lane said. “That involves having correspondent banking relationships with banks in those areas where those currencies are predominant and then being able to create a similar type of network as to what we’ve created with the SEN.”\n","\n","Dry powder\n","\n","Taking Silvergate public has given the crypto industry a clearer window into the bank’s business. It also positions Silvergate to more easily raise capital should the need arise.\n","\n","Currently, Silvergate has a 10.5 percent leverage ratio, meaning the bank has more than twice the amount of capital required by banking regulators (5 percent).\n","https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2020/01/30/the-end-of-cash-and-age-of-crypto-coming-by-2030/\n","https://news.mit.edu/2020/spider-cryptocurrency-routing-efficiency-0130\n","https://news.mit.edu/2020/spider-cryptocurrency-routing-efficiency-0130\n","['Rob Matheson']\n","None\n","A new cryptocurrency-routing scheme co-invented by MIT researchers can boost the efficiency — and, ultimately, profits — of certain networks designed to speed up notoriously slow blockchain transactions.\n","\n","Cryptocurrencies hold promise for peer-to-peer financial transactions, potentially making banks and credit cards obsolete. But there’s a scalability issue: Bitcoin, for instance, processes only a handful of transactions per second, while major credit cards process hundreds or thousands. That’s because the blockchain — the digital ledger cryptocurrencies are built on — takes a really long time to process transactions.\n","\n","A new solution is “payment channel networks” (PCNs), where transactions are completed with minimal involvement from the blockchain. Pairs of PCN users form off-blockchain escrow accounts with a dedicated amount of money, forming a large, interconnected network of joint accounts. Users route payments through these accounts, only pinging the blockchain to establish and close the accounts, which speeds things up dramatically. Accounts can also collect a tiny fee when transactions get routed through them.\n","\n","Inefficient routing schemes, however, slow down even these fast solutions. They deplete users’ balances in these accounts frequently, forcing them to invest a lot of money in each account or frequently rebalance their accounts on the blockchain. In a paper being presented next month at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, the researchers introduce “Spider,” a more efficient routing scheme that lets users invest only a fraction of funds in each account and process roughly four times more transactions before rebalancing on the blockchain.\n","\n","“It’s important to have balanced, high-throughput routing in PCNs to ensure the money that users put into joint accounts is used efficiently,” says first author Vibhaalakshmi Sivaraman, a graduate student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). “This should be efficient and a lucrative business. That means routing as many transactions as possible, with as little funds as possible, to give PCNs the best bang for their buck.”\n","\n","Joining Sivaraman on the paper are former postdoc Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan, CSAIL graduate students Parimarjan Negi and Lei Yang, and Mohammad Alizadeh, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and a CSAIL researcher; Radhika Mittal of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Kathleen Ruan and Giulia Fanti of Carnegie Mellon University.\n","\n","Packet payments\n","\n","PCNs rely heavily on bidirectional joint accounts — where both parties can receive and send money — so money can be routed between any users. User B can have a joint account with user A, while also linking separately to user C. Users A and C are not directly connected, but user A can send money to user C via the A-B and B-C joint accounts.\n","\n","To exchange funds, each party must approve and update the balances in their joint accounts. Payments can only be routed on channels with sufficient funds to handle the transactions, causing major issues.\n","\n","Traditional schemes send transactions along the shortest path possible, without being aware of any given user’s balance or the rate of sending on that account. This can cause one of the users in the joint account to handle too many transactions and drop to a zero balance, making it unable to route further transactions. What’s more, users can only send a payment in full. If a user wants to send, say, 10 bitcoins, current schemes try to push the full amount on the shortest path possible. If that path can’t support all 10 bitcoins at once, they’ll search for the next shortest path, and so on — which can slow down or completely fail the transaction.\n","\n","Inspired by a technique for internet communications called packet switching, Spider splits each full transaction into smaller “packets” that are sent across different channels at different rates. This lets the scheme route chunks of these large payments through potentially low-funded accounts. Each packet is then far more likely to reach its destination without slowing down the network or being rejected in any given account for its size.\n","\n","“Shortest-path routing can cause imbalances between accounts that deplete key payment channels and paralyze the system,” Sivaraman says. “Routing money in a way that the funds of both users in each joint account are balanced allows us to reuse the same initial funds to support as many transactions as possible.”\n","\n","\n","\n","All queued up\n","\n","Another innovation was creating queues at congested accounts. If an account can’t handle incoming transactions that require it to send money, instead of rejecting them, it queues them up. Then, it waits for any transactions that will replenish its funds — within a reasonable time frame — to be able to process those transactions.\n","\n","“If you’re waiting on a queue, but I send you funds within the next second, you can then use any of those funds to send your waiting transactions,” Sivaraman says.\n","\n","The researchers also adopted an algorithm — built by Alizadeh and other researchers — that monitors data center congestion to identify queueing delays at congested accounts. This helps control the rate of transactions. Say user A sends funds to user C through user B, which has a long queue. The receiver C sends the sender A, along with the payment confirmation, one bit of information representing the transaction’s wait time at user B. If it’s too long, user A routes fewer transactions through user B. As the queueing time decreases, account A routes more transactions through B. In this manner, by monitoring the queues alone, Spider is able to ensure that the rate of transactions is both balanced and as high as possible.\n","\n","Ultimately, the more balanced the routing of PCNs, the smaller the capacity required — meaning, overall funds across all joint accounts — for high transaction throughput. In PCN simulations, Spider processed 95 percent of all transactions using only 25 percent of the capacity needed in traditional schemes.\n","\n","The researchers also ran tests on tricky transactions called “DAGs,” which are one-directional payments where one user inevitably runs out of funds and needs to rebalance on the blockchain. A key metric for the performance of PCNs on DAG transactions is the number of off-chain transactions enabled for each transaction on the blockchain. In this regard, Spider is able to process eight times as many off-chain transactions for each transaction on-chain. In contrast, traditional schemes only support twice as many off-chain transactions.\n","\n","“Even with extremely frequent rebalancing, traditional schemes can’t process all DAG transactions. But with very low-frequency rebalancing, Spider can complete them all,” Sivaraman says.\n","\n","Next, the researchers are making Spider more robust to DAG transactions, which can cause bottlenecks. They’re also exploring data privacy issues and ways to incentivize users to use Spider.\n","https://www.archpaper.com/2020/01/akon-finalizes-cryptocurrency-city-senegal/\n","https://www.archpaper.com/2020/01/akon-finalizes-cryptocurrency-city-senegal/\n","['Jonathan Hilburg']\n","2020-01-30 18:41:27+00:00\n","On January 13, pop singer Akon confirmed via tweet that his 2,000-acre, cryptocurrency-powered city in Senegal would soon break ground.

Keys, i.e., private keys, sign, and confirm transactions. If you don’t own the private key, the bitcoins associated with it are not yours.\n","\n","Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao – The Largest Financial B2B Expo\n","\n","That’s why it’s not recommended to leave coins on an exchange unless you are actively trading them. While exchanges may be a straightforward way to store your coins, it doesn’t take much effort to HODL using open source software and procedures.\n","\n","As an alternative to banking, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network that transfers value without third parties. Yet, some of the same intermediaries in the financial sector (such as custodians) are being replicated in the cryptocurrency industry.\n","\n","Custodians want to keep your bitcoins safe for you, but their business model goes against the purpose of cryptocurrency. To enable individual sovereignty and financial privacy. Custodians take these away from the user.\n","\n","How Does Crypto Custody Work?\n","\n","The custody of crypto-assets is a unique issue as it involves both cryptography and cybersecurity. In traditional markets, central security depositories use electronic record keeping to manage assets under a bank’s custody. Once securities became dematerialized, the role of a custodian bank turned into an administrative service (rather than safeguarding a paper certificate).\n","\n","But with cryptocurrencies, the problems of physical safe-keeping return. Which raises the question, what entities should assume this role, given the required expertise in public-key cryptography and blockchain technology?\n","\n","Transactions on the Bitcoin network rely on public-key cryptography. Public keys generate addresses while a corresponding private key signs transactions. You must not share the private key with anyone to ensure no one else can access your funds. Possession of the private key establishes ownership of the funds that the key controls, making bitcoin a bearer asset.\n","\n","The traditional definition of custody (i.e., holding something of yours, on your behalf) does not apply to crypto-assets. Once you share your private key or delegate some form of control, it means that the custodian owns that bitcoin too.\n","\n","The Drawbacks of Crypto Custodians\n","\n","The business of cryptocurrency custody is moving along slowly. Fidelity has shown interest in cryptocurrency for years now, but have only rolled their custody service in October 2019. Despite the care and effort put in place by custodians with passwords, vaults, and precautions, there is no way of assessing the security of private keys from internal and external threats.\n","\n","Also, there is a conflict between keeping private keys secure and auditing a custodian’s crypto-assets. This is a problem unique to cryptocurrency because of its reliance on public-key cryptography to denote ownership. It remains to be seen how the regulatory requirements (such as surprise audits) and safeguarding of these assets will be reconciled. Because of the lack of regulatory oversight on cryptocurrency custodians, we do not know what the security features mean in practice or how legitimate their services are.\n","\n","Suggested articles Rob Frasca Talks Ndau as an Adaptive Store of ValueGo to article >>\n","\n","It is also uncertain how custodians will mitigate adviser fraud and mismanagement because of the practical complexities involved in securing bearer assets like private keys. As a result, no regulator can stamp out this type of fraud completely. The centralization of power and influence is a major concern with crypto-custody solutions, and we’ll detail this more below.\n","\n","Centralization of Power\n","\n","Many of the exchanges offering custody solutions already hold a significant amount of the supply of bitcoin. For example, a massive migration in December 2018 saw Coinbase move five percent of all circulating bitcoin (at the time), along with eight percent of all ether and 25 percent of all Litecoin.\n","\n","Cryptocurrency custody services give exchanges even more influence over the supply of crypto-assets. Custody providers that operate other business lines may abuse their position. What’s stopping exchanges from using their own custody services to cross-subsidize their other business lines?\n","\n","The threat of reputational damage, but it is not impossible that custodians may act in this way.\n","\n","If we look at custodians in traditional finance, we see that some have failed before. BNY Mellon’s custodian arm failed to protect their client’s assets in 2015, mixing them with the bank’s own or borrowing money from one client’s account to pay another.\n","\n","As institutional interest in cryptocurrency develops, hackers will start testing the security models of custodians. If a handful of these businesses store a large number of coins, it becomes a point of failure for Bitcoin. A breach of their security systems may mean that a group of hackers ends up having a large influence on the price of bitcoin.\n","\n","No custodian will want to face being the first to deal with a hack. It will happen – it’s better that retail traders avoid this risk completely.\n","\n","In the second installment, we’ll explain further how custody is opposed to the purpose of cryptocurrency and give you practical tips on an alternative to third-party custodians.\n","01/31/2020\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&tbm=nws&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/31/2020,cd_max:01/31/2020,sbd:1&sa=X&hl=en&gl=us&as_drrb=b&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&gbv=1&sei=NNqhYP2nN8nKtQabpbn4Dg\n","None\n","https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/181196?hl=en\n","None\n","https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9kcfe2s_wAhVJZc0KHZtSDu8QPAgI\n","#\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9kcfe2s_wAhVJZc0KHZtSDu8Q_AUIDigA\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/31/2020,cd_max:01/31/2020,sbd:1&tbm=bks&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9kcfe2s_wAhVJZc0KHZtSDu8Q_AUIECgC\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/31/2020,cd_max:01/31/2020&tbm=vid&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9kcfe2s_wAhVJZc0KHZtSDu8Q_AUIESgD\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:01/31/2020,cd_max:01/31/2020&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9kcfe2s_wAhVJZc0KHZtSDu8Q_AUIEigE\n","/preferences\n","https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-heads-into-historically-positive-february-on-a-bullish-note\n","https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-heads-into-historically-positive-february-on-a-bullish-note\n","[]\n","2020-01-31 11:38:50+00:00\n","View\n","\n","Bitcoin's January surge has put the bulls in the driver's seat, opening the doors for a continued rally into five figures.\n","\n","A minor pullback to $9,000 could be seen in the next 24 hours or so, with intraday indicators are flashing bearish signals.\n","\n","The overall bull bias will remain intact as long as prices are holding above recent lows near $8,200.\n","\n","Bitcoin is holding its bullish trend while heading into the historically strong month of February.\n","\n","The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid below $7,000 on Jan. 3 and has been on an upward trajectory ever since, rising to three-month highs near $9,570 on Thursday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.\n","\n","At the current price of $9,350, bitcoin is up 30 percent on a month-to-date basis – its best January performance since 2013.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","Additionally, the cryptocurrency is on track to register a double-digit monthly gain for the first time since June 2019, when prices had rallied by 26 percent.

On January 29, Messari researcher Ryan Watkins explained that the stablecoin value transfer issued on the ETH chain recently flipped the number of native ether transactions. Essentially, Ethereum’s value transfer is now largely made up of stablecoins like tether, pax, and dai.\n","\n","Also read: Cashfusion Far More Practical Than Other Coinjoin Protocols, Says Data Analyst\n","\n","Researcher: ‘Ethereum’s Economy Now Dominated by Stable Value Transfer’\n","\n","On Wednesday, Messari analyst Ryan Watkins reported on the Ethereum blockchain and how the ETH economy is now dominated by stablecoins. The ETH chain has a great number of stablecoins such as TUSD, USDT, DAI, PAX, and GUSD. All five of these stablecoins leverage the ETH chain for stable value transfers. “Stablecoin transfer value has now flipped ETH on Ethereum,” Watkins tweeted. While sharing another chart, Watkins indicated that most of the story is consumed by tether (USDT) transitioning to Ethereum last year. Watkins believes the flippening took place in mid-2019 and emphasized that since then “Ethereum’s economy is now dominated by stable value transfer.”\n","\n","During the last week of August 2019, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the significant migration of tether from the Omni Layer network to Ethereum. At the time, ERC20 tether transactions flipped their Omni equivalent. The stablecoin tether is a $4.6 billion dollar network and all the coins are issued and maintained on chains like BTC (Omni), ETH (ERC20), EOS, and Tron. After the significant migration into the ERC20 standard, a majority of the USDT in circulation stems from the ETH chain. Additionally, researchers have noted that 70% of the circulating tether supply is controlled by roughly 104 addresses. Following Watkins’ tweet about stablecoins flipping the chain’s native currency ether, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) commented on the topic.\n","\n","“Many of us (early adopters) don’t like stablecoins,” CZ tweeted. “But [the] fact is, that’s what’s needed to help us cross the chasm, as most new crypto people will still think in fiat base for a while to come. I wish that’s not the case, but we live on earth, not utopia.”\n","\n","One person disagreed with CZ and said that certain stablecoins will likely remove revenue from trading platforms. “Very hypocritical — I totally agree with you about centralized stablecoins like Paxos – Binance USD or USDC,” the individual wrote. “[But] how about crypto — collateralized ones like DAI? The truth is that [decentralized finance] apps, like Uniswap, [and] Makerdao take away a lot of revenue from exchanges like Binance,” he added. However, the Binance founder said he wasn’t worried about that situation and stated:\n","\n","The more choices for users, and the more innovation for the industry, the better for all of us. Don’t worry about Binance, we will manage — We are adaptable.\n","\n","Stablecoins and Exchange Tokens Outshine 2017-2018 ICO Tokens That Used Ethereum’s ERC20 Standard\n","\n","Another crypto proponent agreed with CZ’s assessment and said: “That’s usually how new tech and ideas are adopted. The present generation needs one foot on the old and one on the new at the same time to feel safe and be familiarized in their new surroundings.” Out of the five stablecoins maintained on the ETH chain, tether USDT is by far the most dominant. This is followed by Circle’s USDC, Makerdao’s DAI, Pax Global’s PAX, True USD (TUSD), and Gemini’s GUSD.\n","\n","Today, @RyanWatkins_ reported that transfer value of stablecoins on ethereum has surpassed that of $ETH.

In addition to all the stablecoin value held on Ethereum, a great number of exchange tokens leverage the chain. For example, exchange tokens like BNB, LEO, HT, CRO, OKB, and KCS just scratch the surface when it comes to exchange-created coins hosted on the ETH chain. Stablecoins and exchange tokens are the most used ERC20s today by a long shot, and they have surpassed most of the initial coin offering (ICO) ERC20s issued in 2017-2018. Observers like Watkins and others have asked whether “it is good for ETH or does it damage ETH’s monetary premium?” Watkins further discusses this topic in his latest research analysis hosted on the Messari website.\n","\n","What do you think about stablecoins flipping ether on the Ethereum chain?

Before publicly announcing the security flaw, Kraken in Oct. 2019 revealed details of the attack to Trezor. Ledger’s security team, Ledger Donjon, also conducted similar research last year.\n","\n","According to Kraken Chief Security Officer Nick Percoco, the flaw is an inherent to the microcontroller used in Trezor's wallets, which is why the vulnerability persists despite Trezor's knowledge of it.\n","\n","\"It's a flaw that's present in the hardware, not something they can just put a formal update on and fix it for all their customers,\" he told The Block. \"To address this problem, they would essentially need to put out a new device.\"\n","\n","Following Kraken's blog post, Trezor cited in a tweet its official response to Ledger’s research dated Mar. 2019.

Analysts believe it could be a blockbuster year for Bitcoin and for the crypto market in general. In January, the Bitcoin market gained steam and has finally broken through the level of $9,000 for the first time in 2020.\n","\n","On the wave of bullish crypto market sentiment, now seems like a great time to start investing in Bitcoin. Let us figure out how and where to buy Bitcoin and store it safely.\n","\n","How to buy Bitcoin\n","\n","There are a few clear steps you should take before purchasing Bitcoin for the first time. Once you are ready, you can learn to buy Bitcoin in no time, as simply as using any other mobile app on your phone.\n","\n","Step 1. How to buy BTC: choose a trustworthy Bitcoin trading app\n","\n","There is a whole bunch of crypto exchanges out there with different performance and levels of credibility. You should focus on an award-winning and regulated crypto exchange. With Currency.com you can buy, sell and hold your crypto assets safely.\n","\n","An online crypto exchange is a marketplace that operates similarly to platforms that traders use to buy stocks. The BTC exchange connects you directly to the Bitcoin marketplace, where you can exchange traditional fiat currencies for Bitcoin.\n","\n","Bitcoin exchanges resemble Forex markets. These are digital platforms where you can exchange BTC to USD, BTC to EUR, BTC to GBP or choose any other crypto-to-fiat currency pair.\n","\n","Although the crypto exchange serves as a one-stop solution compliant with the most stringent security standards and AML rules, you should note that it is not recommended to store large amounts of Bitcoins on your account for a long time. While the in-built wallets are secure enough to ensure smooth trading, it is advisable to transfer your crypto holdings to an external wallet.\n","\n","This leads us to the next step of our journey – choosing a Bitcoin wallet. Experts believe you should stick to the one with a multi-signature facility.\n","\n","Step 2. How to buy Bitcoin safely: choose the right wallet.\n","\n","Since Bitcoins are not literally coins they need a special place to be kept securely. You should choose a digital wallet to store your Bitcoin holdings until you are ready to spend them or exchange to another currency.\n","\n","The major challenge is to choose a crypto wallet you can trust. Crypto wallets operate through private and public keys, which represent long strings of numbers and letters, created through a mathematical encryption algorithm.\n","\n","Public key works as a location where Bitcoin transactions are deposited to and withdrawn from. These keys appear on the Blockchain ledger as a user’s digital signature.\n","\n","works as a location where Bitcoin transactions are deposited to and withdrawn from. These keys appear on the Blockchain ledger as a user’s digital signature. Private key is a password necessary to buy, sell and trade the Bitcoin in a wallet. This key should be protected and used only to authorise Bitcoin transactions.\n","\n","Some traders prefer to encrypt a Bitcoin wallet with a strong password, and in some cases choose a cold storage option.\n","\n","What exactly do we mean by saying a 'cold' and 'hot' wallet? In-built or ‘hot’ wallets offered by some exchanges are regarded as more agile and safe for exchanging crypto to fiat. Although they guarantee the highest level of security for clients’ assets, they still incur some external risks.\n","\n","That is why many traders stick to offline or ‘cold’ wallets, when it comes to storing significant amounts of crypto assets. Cold wallets, representing special hardware devices, are not vulnerable to fraudulent activity when they are offline.\n","\n","Step 3. How to buy Bitcoin easily: choose a payment method you want\n","\n","Open a trading account in less than 3 min Create account\n","\n","Bitcoin exchanges accept different payment options. Today you can use traditional payment methods, such as a bank transfer, credit and debit card transactions or even Apple Pay to fund your account and buy Bitcoins.\n","\n","You simply click the 'Buy' or 'Sell' button on the exchange and select the payment method you want.\n","\n","Credit and debit card payments are considered the most popular and user-friendly options, as they require less time. However, they may impose higher fees. Bank transfers, in turn, usually have lower fees, but they are more time-consuming.\n","\n","Step 4. Buy Bitcoin now\n","\n","Once you have set up your account on the crypto exchange, decided where to store your Bitcoins and what payment method to choose – you are ready to buy some Bitcoins or its fractions.\n","\n","The crypto exchange will provide you with the real-time streaming Bitcoin price rate and show how much of a Bitcoin (or how many Bitcoins) you can buy for a particular sum of money.\n","\n","Note that Bitcoin is used to skyrocketing and drastically sinking throughout its history. And even if you do not have enough funds to buy a Bitcoin, you can buy a fraction and trade it further to earn more.\n","\n","To place a trade at Currency.com or another platform, you input the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy in the given field and click the ‘Buy’ button. This is a classic market buy order, which will purchase Bitcoin at the best market rate.\n","\n","Once you have executed your purchase, your new Bitcoin assets will be stored in your Currency.com account. It is up to you to decide what to do with them next.\n","\n","Step 5. Withdraw or hold your Bitcoins to sell them further.\n","\n","Now when you have Bitcoins on your account, you start thinking what to do next. There are always several options.\n","\n","Trade Bitcoin\n","\n","If you have an account on a crypto trading platform you can not only buy Bitcoin at a competitive price, but also sell or exchange it. A wide choice of crypto-to-fiat currency pairs open enormous opportunities for traders to make money from price movements. You can sell Bitcoin the same way you buy it. Simply put a sell order, specifying the amount you want to sell, and the exchange will execute your order.\n","\n","Hold Bitcoin\n","\n","Having shown some positive price dynamics since the beginning of 2020, Bitcoin is considered a lucrative store of value. If you share the bullish forecasts for Bitcoin price, you may decide to hold your coins for a while and try to reap more profit.\n","\n","Spend Bitcoin\n","\n","It’s easy to forget that you can always use Bitcoin to buy goods and services. The list of vendors and retailers who accept Bitcoin payments, including Starbucks, Whole Foods and Nordstrom, is steadily growing.\n","\n","According to SpendBitcoins.com, over 100,000 merchants are ready to provide almost anything you would like to buy with Bitcoin.\n","\n","In the end\n","\n","Bitcoin has proved to be a strong cryptocurrency which deserves investor attention. Today many traditional stock investors and traders choose Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies to diversify their investment portfolio. Although the crypto market and Bitcoin in particular is very volatile, it can bring you significant profit.

To make things easier, we’ve put together a comprehensive guide to bring you up to speed on the latest changes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Crypto-assets have entered the mainstream in the past few years, attracting the attention of tax authorities in leading economies. Following a boom in trading and prices, the gains made from crypto-related deals and activities are starting to be counted toward taxable income. Especially in the developed countries, tax authorities have tools to track unreported income.\n","\n","\n","\n","Cryptocurrency taxation accelerated after 2014, when Bitcoin and a handful of assets arrived on stage. With the arrival of significant gains in 2017, most tax authorities prepared to reinvent their rules and attempt stricter regulations on potentially hidden income.\n","\n","Having a general idea of when taxable events occur make it possible for crypto investors to make informed decisions, and avoid working in breach of local laws.\n","\n","Overall, the past 12 months saw shifts in regulations related to cryptocurrency. Tax regulators started not only passively reminding investors to pay any due taxes, but also issued specific guidelines and warnings on reporting income. It is possible that the IRS can also track transactions for some networks. The latest status of tax requirements and the level of interest that tax authorities pay to crypto assets varies by country and region, with the tax rates ranging from zero to as high as 55%. For now, the IRS 60X rule for futures and options trading refers only to forex options and futures, where 60% of gains or losses are accounted as long-term capital gain, and 40% are treated as short-term capital gains.\n","\n","The Legal Status of Digital Currencies, Tokens, or Coins\n","\n","The general consensus is that digital currencies of any form or based on any technology represent a type of ownership. The nature of the asset is relative as some types of tokens are considered securities.\n","\n","Worldwide, regulations differ, but so far, no country has admitted any digital asset as “money”, “currency” or legal tender. Crypto assets are usually categorized as commodities, or a form of property.\n","\n","So far, merely holding digital assets in a wallet is not a reportable event for most tax jurisdictions. But the most important concept is that of capital gains, or gains and losses realized upon the sale of a digital coin or token. Because cryptocurrency prices are extremely variable, it is highly possible that not all coins are sold for a gain.\n","\n","Taxing and legalizing BTC and crypto trading is a complex issue, with each nation having its own set of rules. A handy list compiled by Reuters may be the starting point for exploring one’s specific tax situation and events that need to be reported.\n","\n","Capital Gains from Crypto Sales\n","\n","A capital gain is a rise in the value of any asset held, whether stocks, real estate, or in this case, ownership of digital assets. A capital gain is only realized when the asset is sold.\n","\n","It’s important to differentiate between a short-term capital gain, where the asset is held for less than a year. Longer-term holding means the sale will be taxed at the usually more favorable rate for long-term capital gains.\n","\n","Because of the turbulent nature of cryptocurrency trading, short-term capital gains reporting may be more involved, requiring a log of all trading activity, as well as gains or losses realized.\n","\n","The rule of short-term, or long-term gains may be applied depending on jurisdiction, and some taxation forms do not allow for such a differentiation.\n","\n","Taxable Events\n","\n","The other important concept on trading crypto assets may be the actualization of a taxable event. For some jurisdictions, this may be as simple as selling the underlying asset.\n","\n","But for US nationals, a taxable event may arise in other situations. Those may include:\n","\n","Using cryptocurrency for buying and selling;\n","\n","Exchanges between crypto assets;\n","\n","Coins or tokens allocated in an airdrop;\n","\n","Coins and tokens allocated after a hard fork;\n","\n","Receiving a payment in the form of crypto assets.\n","\n","US taxation rules are not entirely clear on taxing hard forks or tokens received for essentially zero-value. There is no consensus on what is the fair value of an airdrop, but it must be kept in mind it is possible some assets may be counted as a taxable event.\n","\n","In the past few years, the growth of the sheer number of cryptocurrency assets, in the form of new coins and tokens, makes it impossible to track all assets received. However, some exchanges and other cryptocurrency-related operators may have the duty to report cryptocurrency sales and withdrawals.\n","\n","Case: US-Based Forms\n","\n","US-based exchanges have been asked to produce 1099-K form, which only counts the transaction coming out of the exchange. This means the trader may have sold at a loss, but the end withdrawal may be counted as a gain.\n","\n","To avoid the confusion, US citizens may have to fill out form 8849, which allows for more detailed tracking of asset acquisition and disposal.\n","\n","But this case reveals a more proactive approach, as the IRS started to send out letters reminding traders to pay taxes on their crypto gains. But after more detailed discussions, the IRS has allowed for detailed reporting to describe all exchanges and trades that are relevant to the tax base.\n","\n","Cryptocurrency Ownership\n","\n","At the moment, most blockchains, starting with Bitcoin, are pseudonymous. In theory, it is possible to track ownership, but only if there is voluntary reporting. For tax purposes, authorities count the receipt of assets as a confirmed transaction, and the moment the assets come under control.\n","\n","In 2020, total surveillance of digital asset ownership is not feasible, and the IRS is still not tracking all potential owners. However, in the case of some tokens or specific blockchains, the ownership may be tied at least to a personalized account. In rare cases the issuers of tokens even perform KYC, tying ownership to a real-world identity.\n","\n","But there is no proactive approach to track crypto ownership, and until the assets are sold through an exchange, or in another manner that is traceable, only voluntary reporting remains to inform the taxman.\n","\n","And while the consensus sees crypto gains as taxable, at this point it is still possible for multiple transactions or trades to remain outside the scope of tax authorities. But those conditions may change in the future, exposing anyone that may have tried to disguise crypto ownership or gains.\n","\n","Hard Forks and Capital Gains\n","\n","The issue of hard forks has been highly contentious for cryptocurrency owners. Buying Bitcoin was simple enough. But in the past two years alone, Bitcoin forked into several assets, thus potentially giving all owners the claim to the same amount of coins on other networks.\n","\n","Starting with Bitcoin Cash, there have been more than a dozen forks. And while some of those assets traded at very low prices, the IRS issued requirements in late 2019, which ambiguously claimed a taxable event upon the receipt of a hard fork.\n","\n","But the IRS has not clarified what it means to receive coins in a hard fork. Taking control of those coins is not automatic, and requires a process known as “coin splitting.” Coin splitting requires that an exchange credits the user accounts with the forked coins. The other approach is to move coins to a new wallet, where the balance may be recovered from the new network. Not all owners of BTC choose to gain access and control to all forked coins.\n","\n","This has led to a letter requiring the US IRS to specify what it means by receiving coins in a hard fork, and to avoid taxation that may lead to a high tax bill for a now-worthless asset.\n","\n","Case: Bitcoin Gold\n","\n","Bitcoin Gold was a hard fork from late 2017, which produced an asset initially trading above $500. If the initial IRS guidelines are to be counted, all BTC owners at the time of the hard fork, if they are US citizens, would owe tax on the new asset.\n","\n","But the price basis for Bitcoin Gold is a price that has nothing to do with current market prices. The time of claiming the coins, if that is counted, may be very different from the price when Bitcoin Gold initially traded. BTG subsequently fell to a price as low as $5, and recovered to around $12 in early 2020.\n","\n","Establishing the taxable event for this relatively small fork, as well as other similar attempts at re-creating Bitcoin, is still under discussion.\n","\n","As of December 20, 2019, the IRS is still reviewing a letter from Congress, requiring a revision of the guidelines, and demanding that the latest tax rules are not treated as established law. Instead, the group of Congressmen takes into account the fact that cryptocurrencies are still a new technology, which cannot be captured in the rules of 1099 forms.\n","\n","It is possible that reporting may vary in its detail and intentions, and the IRS cannot foresee and establish each taxable event arising from various digital coins or tokens. Hence, the best approach may be to look at trading history, but also to keep in mind the final gains, as well as funds that entered bank accounts or were received in another manner.\n","\n","How the IRS Defines Crypto Value\n","\n","The idea that cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets represent value, and are hence taxable, stems from the way the IRS codifies those assets as representing value in recognized national currencies, including the US dollar.\n","\n","“Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as “convertible” virtual currency. Bitcoin, Ether, Roblox, and V-bucks are a few examples of a convertible virtual currency. Virtual currencies can be digitally traded between users and can be purchased for, or exchanged into, U.S. dollars, Euros, and other real or virtual currencies,” the IRS stipulates.\n","\n","“The sale or other exchange of virtual currencies, or the use of virtual currencies to pay for goods or services, or holding virtual currencies as an investment, generally has tax consequences that could result in tax liability,” warns the IRS.\n","\n","From those propositions stem most cases where each individual owner or trader may have to figure out the exact approach to report income, based on specific gains or losses.\n","\n","The IRS has a set of guidelines, ranging from general to specific, and has asked for reporting since 2014. But the new tax season has more details on reporting, this time expanding the scope of taxable events. The rules of 2019 are what is considered the most recent and relevant basis for reporting for tax season 2020.\n","\n","Letters of Warning\n","\n","In 2019, the IRS signalled its strong stance on crypto trading by sending 10,000 letters of warning. The letters were of two types – a warning and educational letter, and a more serious one demanding a reply and actions to file the correct tax returns.\n","\n","Letters 6174 and 6174-A require no action. But receiving letter 6173 requires an immediate response, and the failure to do so invites a tax audit.\n","\n","The sending of 10,000 letters suggests IRS may be tracking accounts related to exchanges, most probably Coinbase. The accounts mentioned in the letter do not relate to wallets or other forms of ownership, such as having balances on the blockchain.\n","\n","To file the correct tax return, if required, may be done through form 1040. The warnings and requirements affect persons that have shown activity related to cryptocurrency trading, while failing to mention their ownership and trading operations.\n","\n","Sources of Balance Information\n","\n","Building up the base to calculate taxes may be complicated. Information on balances may be acquired from exchange logs.\n","\n","For now, the IRS has not issued specific requirements for futures or derivatives trading. Futures trading and margin cryptocurrency 100X leverage are also not unusual, and may generate specific income streams. In 2020, there are no specific guidelines on how to tax 200X leverage, or even higher margin calls. But it is possible to claim a loss on trades.\n","\n","Reporting on Bitcoin transactions may also happen using various techniques, including FIFO and LIFO. But in the case of Bitcoin, any specific time of purchase may arrive with different price ranges. This means that a detailed list of transactions may specify exactly which coin was sold, and what is the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.\n","\n","For instance, selling a coin acquired at $8,000 is not the same as one acquired when BTC was $1 or even $30. Hence, there is no requirement to sell earliest coins first, and reporting may focus on an asset purchased at a specific price.\n","\n","This possibility means selling Bitcoin can form a base that can also lead to temporary capital loss, if the reporting person chooses to minimize taxes for a certain time period.\n","\n","Transaction information from wallets is also not revealing all taxable events. Moving coins between owned wallets or addresses is not considered a taxable event. So far, the IRS has not issued guidelines on reporting transactions or revealing the intention behind transactions, or giving any other evidence of private key ownership.\n","\n","Crypto-to-Crypto Exchanges and Stablecoins\n","\n","Perhaps the most confusing moment of cryptocurrency trading is the need to report a switch between crypto assets, as well as any capital gains stemming from those operations.\n","\n","The IRS has a concept of Like-Kind exchange, which does not generate a taxable event when moving between some types of assets. However, this does not apply to cryptocurrency exchanges, which are not registered for Like-Kind swaps. For US citizens, as of 2020, those types of exchanges are only limited to real estate.\n","\n","This also means cryptocurrency exchanges in the US are not registered to support Like-Kind exchanges, and fulfill the requirements to file form 8824. This also means that switching between Bitcoin and altcoins is capable of generating a taxable event.\n","\n","For instance, buying BTC at $6,000, and exchanging it for Ethereum when BTC has already climbed to $9,000 generates the same capital gain of $3,000.\n","\n","However, this gain can be offset by a loss as well. In case the altcoin drops in value, the sale itself generates a loss that may offset the capital gains, in the end leading to a lower tax bill. However, both operations need to be accounted for, until the last liquidation into fiat.\n","\n","Stablecoins and Taxes\n","\n","In 2020, most cryptocurrency trades use one of several coins pegged to the value of the US dollar. Those assets have varied states of legal acceptance, but are widely used worldwide. The most common one, Tether, or USDT, is capable of storing the value of assets sold.\n","\n","In the above example, BTC appreciated from $6,000 to $9,000. However, the asset was exchanged for USDT, meaning the funds are still not switched to fiat. Still, the capital gains may generate a taxable event, which means stablecoins are not suitable tools to disguise capital gains.\n","\n","For US citizens, coins like Paxos, TUSD, or USDC also require complete screening with real-world identity evaluation. For now, exchanges do not report trades that transform gains into stablecoins. However, stablecoin issuers are a potential source of disclosure. Having a Coinbase account, as already discussed, means the IRS may be aware of cryptocurrency activity, while discounting the usage of stablecoins.\n","\n","However, the best approach is to consult an expert on the issue of transactions between cryptocurrencies. The best approach is to have a complete log of activities, to achieve an easier calculation of the tax basis.\n","\n","Crypto Taxation in Canada\n","\n","The Canada Revenue Agency works with a set of guidelines from 2014, advising on the correct filing. Canada supported highly active cryptocurrency activity, and the tax authorities had the tools to track and require payments, similar to the US system.\n","\n","Canada treats cryptocurrencies as commodities for the purposes of taxation. Depending on sources, income tax or capital gains tax is applicable. Canada differentiates between sporadic and regular income, and treats regular activities as sources of business income.\n","\n","As for fair value, the requirement is to estimate and self-report based on general guidelines.\n","\n","“To figure out the value of a cryptocurrency transaction where a direct value cannot be determined, you must use a reasonable method. Keep records to show how you figured out the value. Generally, the CRA’s position is that the fair market value is the highest price, expressed in dollars that a willing buyer and a willing seller who are both knowledgeable, informed and prudent, and who are acting independently of each other, would agree to in an open and unrestricted market,” the Canadian tax authority explained.\n","\n","Crypto-to-crypto exchanges are also causing a taxable event in Canada, similar to the US-based system. Similarly, reporting for Canadian citizens or businesses requires the preservation of most records, including wallet entries, exchange withdrawals and any other relevant data on transfers and acquired coins and tokens.\n","\n","Tax Situation in the EU\n","\n","The European Union is one of the more relaxed regions for cryptocurrency trading. However, most countries are aware of the gains potentially made in cryptocurrency trading.\n","\n","The tax rules within the EU are highly varied, as the overall rules allow trading, while leaving it to countries to figure out the tax accounts of citizens or corporations. For that reason, it is difficult to offer general guidelines on EU-based taxation. The exact rules vary based on local tax rates and types of taxes.\n","\n","There is also a disparity in the way each country views digital coins and tokens. Germany, for instance, sees Bitcoin as money, however, not official money, but a form of “private money”. Switzerland, one of the most lax regulators, accounts for cryptocurrency in the way forex markets are codified when it comes to taxation.\n","\n","For most EU countries, owning digital assets does not need to be declared. Switzerland is an exception, where the Swiss franc value of those assets must be declared in advance at the start of the tax year.\n","\n","However, there is a big exception for speculative trading – not all operations need to be taxed as they happen. This is a big advantage and a relief to EU citizens, where only the initial and final value of assets may be reported.\n","\n","Usually, traders will make a series of deals, and it is rare to see straightforward buying and selling of Bitcoin or other assets. The EU rules may be solved on a case-by-case basis. However, it must be noted EU bank accounts can be traced, and transfers above 5,000 EUR are often scrutinized.\n","\n","EU-Based Exchanges and Brokerages\n","\n","EU-based exchanges and brokerages are usually completely transparent. They are connected to the EU-wide banking system, and offer relatively high limits for trading and withdrawals.\n","\n","However, EU-based exchanges are not obliged to report on taxes and tax events, especially given the decentralized nature of the union, with many different jurisdictions. Thus, all EU citizens must report their gains or losses as physical persons, to pay the taxes owed.\n","\n","The EU taxation rules also apply to Malta, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and other territories that have harmonized their financial legislation. The potentially applicable taxes are, in most cases, physical person income tax; some forms of local taxes; wealth tax when it applies, and possibly corporate tax in case the cryptocurrency activity is related to a business entity.\n","\n","EU and VAT on Crypto Deals\n","\n","Cryptocurrency trading in the EU is treated in a way similar to forex trades. This means the trades do not incur VAT. Merchant usage of cryptocurrencies is also freely available, and for now may be a tool to circumvent VAT payments.\n","\n","Taxing Miners in the EU\n","\n","Cryptocurrency mining is differentiated from speculative activities. Namely, the gains from this activity can be counted as the results of business activity. Thus, the sale price of coins can be offset by business expenses, including the hardware and electricity costs incurred in the process. This approach may require the services of an accountant, which may end up in a lower tax bill.\n","\n","The EU has not issued any specific requirements on income from hard forks or airdrops. For now, capital gains where they apply may be calculated for any coins received and possibly sold for fiat.\n","\n","UK Crypto Taxation\n","\n","The UK has had most of its financial rules harmonized with the EU. However, with Brexit looming as of January 31, 2020, and with a 10-month process of establishing a new relationship with the EU, the UK may have a different set of taxation rules before long.\n","\n","The overall stance of the UK is that cryptocurrency is either an asset/property, or private money. Tax reporting also hinges on the principle of capital gains tax. Sales tax, a form of VAT, does not apply to cryptocurrency deals.\n","\n","Case-By-Case Basis\n","\n","Unlike the US, where the IRS has attempted to create a system of terms, the UK tax service HMRC has taken a case-by-case stance. This means that each transfer or sale may be regarded as a novel situation, looking into where the exchange of value really happened.\n","\n","The HMRC has admitted that cryptocurrency is a new sector, and with the advent of tokens, it has created multiple tax situations that are too complex for a single framework.\n","\n","UK Tax Terms\n","\n","The tax authority has still established some general terms for digital assets. Usually, those\n","\n","Assets utilize a Distributed Ledger, although a distributed ledger does not necessarily use a token or coin. Those assets can be stored, transferred, or exchanged.\n","\n","The HMRC recognizes three types of assets: exchange tokens, utility tokens, and security tokens. Bitcoin, for instance, is considered an exchange token.\n","\n","Taxation happens based on the de facto events regarding value transfers and capital gains, and not on the definition of the token. Thus, selling Bitcoin or a security token incurs the same capital gains tax.\n","\n","The general stance of UK tax authorities is that in the majority of cases, individuals hold onto the tokens as a form of alternative personal investment.\n","\n","“In the vast majority of cases, individuals hold cryptoassets as a personal investment, usually for capital appreciation in its value or to make particular purchases. They will be liable to pay Capital Gains Tax when they dispose of their cryptoassets,” the tax guidelines state.\n","\n","But because the tax authority looks at different cases, using cryptocurrency as an alternative form of payments may incur not only capital gains tax, but also personal income tax and insurance.\n","\n","UK Definition of Crypto Trader\n","\n","UK tax authorities also differentiate between sporadic cryptocurrency deals, and what may be considered “trading” activity. High frequency and volume of activity may constitute financial trading activity, and incur a different type of taxation; once again income tax instead of capital gains tax.\n","\n","“As with any activity, the question whether cryptoasset activities amount to trading depends on a number of factors and the individual circumstances. Whether an individual is engaged in a financial trade through the activity of buying and selling cryptoassets will ultimately be a question of fact. It’s often the case that individuals and companies entering into transactions consisting of buying and selling cryptoassets will describe them as ‘trades’. However, the use of the term ‘trade’ in this context is not sufficient to be regarded as a financial trade for tax purposes,” the tax authority explains.\n","\n","Thus, in the UK, it is important to differentiate between sporadic activity, and what may be considered business-like activity or regular trading.\n","\n","In the case of highly active and regular cryptocurrency-related activities, business income reporting may be necessary, falling under a different set of rules.\n","\n","Airdrops Not Considered Until Liquidation\n","\n","The term disposal means the final act of liquidating digital assets. Like all crypto cases, the UK authorities look at the specifics and whether the airdrops have the nature of assets with potential returns. Generic, goodwill airdrops not related to any purchase or investment, incur capital gains only upon their sale.\n","\n","More specific airdrops which may present dividends or other types of returns present specific challenges, depending on whether the assets were liquidated or if their value presented potential capital gains.\n","\n","Airdrops were a fad in 2017 and 2018, when projects would award tokens for free, as a tool to expand their communities. Those types of generic airdrops can usually be accounted as a capital loss.\n","\n","Token Pooling\n","\n","UK tax reporting has specific rules when accounting for multiple token sales with gains or losses. There is a 30-day waiting rule when acquiring new assets, before they can be pooled when accounting for capital gains or losses. Newly acquired assets that are traded within 30 days of acquisition must be counted separately.\n","\n","Older assets may be used to calculate the cost of sale and the tax basis.\n","\n","For instance, if Alice bought 10 BTC for $1,000, and then bought 10 BTC for $1000,000, she would have a total allowable pooled cost of $101,000. Selling 5 BTC for $40,000 could be discounted with the cost of 5 BTC from the pooled cost, or $25,250. Alice’s total tax gain would be $14,750, on which tax would be due.\n","\n","However, if Alice bought one BTC at $7,000 and sold it days later at $8,000, it would be accounted separately and not pooled with previous purchases for a cost basis.\n","\n","This rule makes the timing of purchases and a detailed log extremely important. Claiming a different cost basis may make a big difference in counting gains or losses. With turbulent crypto prices, this may also make the final tax bill look different. In any case, just like US-based traders or owners, UK tax reporting requires keeping score of all transactions, and being ready to make the case for one’s specific intentions and levels of cryptocurrency activity.\n","\n","Pooling and Hard Forks\n","\n","The HMRC will consider hard forks on a case-by-case basis. This means that if a Bitcoin owner did not decide to split coins, or receive coins from an exchange, tax authorities may be understanding and not require reporting.\n","\n","For instance, a snapshot of the Bitcoin blockchain, which reportedly allowed access to HEX tokens, need not be reported if a user does not intend to take the HEX tokens, or trade them.\n","\n","But if a fork-based asset is acquired, its fair value and cost are not pooled with other tokens, and a sale can be calculated just for that asset.\n","\n","\n","\n","Rekt: Reporting Asset Prices Going to Zero\n","\n","UK-based traders may claim they “disposed” of an asset, where the value has gone to zero. Even without a sale, following general capital gains rules, an asset can be pronounced to have “negligible value”. The zero-based value can then be used in conjunction with the cost basis of pooled assets, to claim capital losses.\n","\n","This rule is especially valuable to altcoins, where indeed losses and crashes to zero have been possible, despite previous spikes to extraordinary valuations.\n","\n","Lost Private Keys\n","\n","Based on the above rule, loss of private keys may be used on a case-by-case basis to avoid paying capital gains. In case of a loss, the user claims negligible value minus the re-acquisition value of the assets, to crystallize a loss. However, the loss must be accepted by the HMRC, to avoid fraudulent claims. The tax authorities do not track blockchains, and claiming to have owned and lost private keys must be supported by evidence.\n","\n","However, the HMRC does not have provisions for theft or loss of digital assets, except for the potential to claim negligible value.\n","\n","As seen above, the UK guidelines are extremely detailed and also flexible, to reflect the shifting nature of the cryptocurrency space. The above cases may be made for other jurisdictions, and reveal examples in which tax authorities do not have a proactive outreach, but may be amenable to reporting or negotiations.\n","\n","The latest UK regulation on cryptocurrency dates back from 2018, and there may be changes once Brexit becomes a reality.\n","\n","Southeast Asia, Japan and China: Specifics in Crypto Taxation\n","\n","Southeast Asia is one of the hottest regions for cryptocurrency activity. For that reason, in the past few years, tax authorities have also reawakened to the reality of relatively high potential gains from trading.\n","\n","Japan considers Bitcoin as a legal method of payments. Its approach is to levy capital gains tax on sales made for profit or loss. Cryptocurrency payment is highly developed in Japan, but payments are exempt from consumption tax.\n","\n","Japanese taxation is relatively high, ranging between 15 and 55%, with mandatory reporting required on gains made based on crypto assets. The taxation depends on tax brackets, and is higher in comparison to gains from international stocks. Japan has allowed exchanges to link directly to banks, and trading is not anonymous, hence traceable by the National Tax Authority.\n","\n","China, for now, is still the Wild East when it comes to crypto. All coins and tokens are considered a “virtual commodity”. Ownership, trading, and disposal of cryptocurrencies are still a legal gray area.\n","\n","As of 2020, China has still not levied tax on digital asset gains, despite the highly active trading activities. Exchanges may report in the form of corporate taxes, but for individuals, there is no tracking or compulsory reporting.\n","\n","The reason for this may be the fact that China tried hard to separate the world of banking and fiat from trading cryptocurrencies. Back in 2017, most exchanges stopped offering pairs with the Chinese yuan, and switched to trading between coins only, with the aid of stablecoins. Legal observations have not noted any specific rules regarding cryptocurrency reporting, except for monitoring and auditing general wealth.\n","\n","Since the fall of 2017, it has been near-impossible to trade in fiat. Hence, Chinese traders moved their activity entirely on the blockchain, and into USDT tokens. China is thus unable to track bank accounts, or link exchange accounts to real persons. Its aim to deprive the crypto sector of a fiat gateway is also hampering the potential to collect taxes.\n","\n","The chief reason for China’s stance is to impress its rules on capital controls. However, the potential to move cryptocurrency internationally has somewhat managed to circumvent those controls, at least partially.\n","\n","Crypto regulations constantly fluctuate in Southeast Asian countries. It is possible some countries levy taxes where there were none before.\n","\n","Currently, Singapore levies no tax on crypto transactions. However, the country is very strict about money laundering, and has capital controls to avoid funds flowing out of the country. Selling cryptocurrency in Singapore may in the end require foreign citizens to report the sale to their respective countries’ tax authorities, or face a penalty and even imprisonment.\n","\n","Thailand’s model is relatively simple, levying a 15% capital gains tax, while allowing a waiver of the 7% VAT in the country.\n","\n","Hong Kong is also offering tax-free Bitcoin sales, and does not require specific reporting on trades. However, income in cryptocurrency for merchants may have to be reported in Hong Kong dollar value.\n","\n","Foreign nationals, however, are mostly blocked by significant difficulties in liquidating assets in those regions. Attempting to avoid taxes may be a complex affair for foreign nationals, and lead to potential penalties.\n","\n","Cryptocurrency laws in Asia are also constantly reinvented, mostly focusing on fraud, consumer finance risks, as well as money laundering. For now, the regions have more lenient policies on taxation.\n","\n","Russia: Still Struggling to Tax Crypto Assets\n","\n","Russia is yet another region where cryptocurrency activity is extremely high. Yet the country is still not ready with regulations, and trading is a big gray area. For now, cryptocurrency activity flies under the radar of tax authorities.\n","\n","But the Russian Duma may be working on new legislation, potentially tracking cryptocurrency activity and finally taxing individuals. For now, Russia still allows low-verification trading on some exchanges, which remain high-risk. Banks have offered to track transactions coming from cryptocurrency sales, but for now, Russian traders and sellers may fly under the tax radar.\n","\n","So, Can Crypto Avoid Some Taxes?\n","\n","In 2020, it looks like most of the Western countries and some markets in Asia are on track with taxing cryptocurrency gains. The IRS has taken the most proactive approach by linking identities to Coinbase accounts. But there are still offshore regions where cryptocurrency sales may be tax-exempt.\n","\n","There is a caveat though- for most jurisdictions, the location of assets is considered the country of citizenship. This means even if a token is held on an offshore exchange, its location can still be considered the UK or the US for tax purposes.\n","\n","Still, there are regions where a tax-free sale could be achieved, alongside other techniques for offshore businesses.\n","\n","Slovenia, part of the EU, has all the benefits of a fully legalized market, plus zero capital gains tax on cryptocurrency sales. However, income in cryptocurrency is taxed with personal income tax. But overall, speculative trading may be possible for local residents without capital gains tax.\n","\n","Belarus, while not in the EU, is one of the regions where crypto taxation is a gray area. The country, despite political risks, is still a haven of crypto activity, for those willing to get exposure to its regime and economy.\n","\n","Offshore zones already mentioned include Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as possibly China’s Hainan special economic zone. But similar possibilities exist for Barbados, Malaysia, and Mauritius. Other offshore zones with special cryptocurrency rules include Puerto Rico, the hurricane-stricken country which attracted Bitcoiners.\n","\n","But perhaps the biggest advantage is that cryptocurrency trades are VAT-exempt, limiting the liability when switching to fiat.\n","\n","Tools to Calculate Crypto Taxes\n","\n","The tax base could be calculated using logs from wallets or exchanges. But there are tools that make the tracking of transactions easier, as well as the balances required to calculate the tax base.\n","\n","Tools like Koinly consolidate exchange information, wallet transactions, and include the potential for professional advice to achieve the minimal potential tax payment. Koinly works with multiple major tax authorities, for detailed reports with complete compliance.\n","\n","The eToro brokerage and trading platform also includes tax calculation for UK citizens. It is also possible to use generic free tools for easier calculation. Crypto tax calculators usually support information directly from exchanges to complete the reports.\n","\n","Taxing Mining Income\n","\n","Mining income is, in most cases, treated as regular business income, with rules applying to the specific jurisdiction. The biggest advantage of miners is they may claim the expenses of hardware and electricity to decrease the tax basis. In the past, mining has been an amateur activity. But since 2016, cryptocurrency mining 50x increases in activity were not unusual, for Bitcoin and other assets.\n","\n","Depending on the coin mined, the value of this activity may be extremely low, as in the case of amateur mining. But Bitcoin mining may be used as a tool to decrease the tax basis for most miners. With multiple operations situated in China, it is possible some miners fly under the radar.\n","\n","Best Approach to Crypto Taxation\n","\n","The best approach to cryptocurrency taxation is to err on the side of reporting. Regulations shift all the time, and depending on the potential for surveillance on bank accounts, tax authorities may be more aggressive in seeking out earnings originating from cryptocurrency exchanges. Simply having a big unexplained balance may alert tax authorities.\n","\n","The rules of residence may vary, as some regions may have more lenient taxation.\n","\n","The other requirement is to keep detailed records of all activities, either using specialized tools or tracking and copying each transaction or operation to calculate the most favorable tax base based on regional rules.\n","\n","For now, there is no need to report or reveal addresses or wallets, or declare a connection between a name and an address. But in the future, blockchain tracking may become a big part of taxation rules. Currently, only a few startups are working on tracking the blockchain, identifying “whales” and significant moves. But in the future, assets themselves may not be fungible and anonymous, leading to a stricter potential for taxation.\n","\n","With season 2020 in full swing for reporting, the world of cryptocurrency also faced stricter regulations in the EU, as well as the USA, coming into force in the new year. Increased surveillance also looks like a positive fact, in that cryptocurrency has been accepted among investment methods, and taxing is a way to legitimize that activity.\n","\n","Did you find this comprehensive tax guide useful?

In his latest weekly crypto outlook, Brandt says the leading cryptocurrency is now showing early signs that it could climb “a lot higher” than $100k.\n","\n","“We can use this recent low that we’ve seen back in December that connects back to December 2018 as kind of now redefining the parabolic advance that could be in the process of developing now. And that has implications.\n","\n","I don’t want to get too far ahead of myself because I can make an argument here that I’m not sure really can be made yet – that we’re going a lot higher than $100,000, and it won’t be until 2021.”\n","\n","Brandt says BTC may be coiling in a bullish symmetrical triangle that dates back to late 2017.\n","\n","ADVERTISEMENT\n","\n","“A continuation symmetrical triangle is a coil that contains four major contact points. If we fail at this upper line and turn down, then it could be a symmetrical triangle top.\n","\n","But for now, I’m going to look at it as a symmetrical triangle continuation, and as time goes on and we start to challenge this upper line, especially if we take out the highs that we made back here in June, then we’ve completed this symmetrical triangle, and we can really start accelerating the bull trend in Bitcoin.”\n","\n","As for the altcoin market, Brandt says Litecoin is also showing signs of a potential bullish triangle similar to that of Bitcoin.\n","\n","“Symmetrical triangles or triangulations tend to be a magic pattern with Litecoin, and you can see it a couple of places here – the big ascending triangle that blew off in 2017 and you had another triangulation [in 2018]. You’ve had different triangulations taking place, especially symmetrical triangles in Litecoin.”\n","\n","As for XRP, Brandt says he often hears from investors who closely follow the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Although Brandt says XRP may prove to be a “boomer” and rise exponentially in value, he stresses his belief that Bitcoin is the real crypto asset to watch\n","\n","“I know many of you are Ripple fans, XRP fans. I’m sorry, I just can’t get all excited about that. I’ve talked about that in the past with you many times. For me, this is a Bitcoin story. Bitcoin is the legacy coin. I don’t want to be sidetracked because I think the granddaddy of them all is going to continue to be Bitcoin.\n","\n","… XRP may very well be a boomer, but it’s also going to be a buster.

At the time, Bitcoin was worth just around $12. During this time, the miner’s reward within the BTC network was a cool 25 BTC per problem solved.\n","\n","The first halving event happened 4 years later in 2016, and the reward was slashed down to the current 12.5 BTC. However, it’s not the decrease of the reward that made history, but rather the event’s significance in catalyzing the price dynamics that followed the halving. By December 2017, Bitcoin was cruising price-wise to a tune of $20,000.\n","\n","Basically, it’s already established that Bitcoin halving really affects the crypto’s price movements and this projection has had many people making variant opinions about the oncoming Bitcoin reward halving expected in May 2020. A great majority of these opinions have been on the bullish side of things. A recent tweet by Weiss Crypto Ratings explicates this.\n","\n","Here’s how #Bitcoin halvings have impacted the market. So, does the Bitcoin halving help drive prices higher? Absolutely. The only question now is how high will #BTC go this time around? pic.twitter.com/YnSp4Y8igO — Weiss Crypto Ratings (@WeissCrypto) February 1, 2020\n","\n","Latency Period\n","\n","However, as much as the BTC halving event may be hyped to mean almost immediate price movement in 2020, it hasn’t always been like that with the previous halving. The halving of 2016 didn’t see much price movement until 2017. It’s already a known fact that the price increase of 2017 was the greatest crypto bull run yet.\n","\n","That said, some crypto analysts are of the opinion that BTC might experience a latency period after the halving of May 2020, meaning that the price may not shoot up immediately after the event.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Going by the 2016 dynamics, the latency period could last almost a year. To some, 2021 may be the year when a sure Bitcoin bull run happens. In fact, some analysts expect BTC to hit the highs of $100k in 2021.\n","\n","BTC Vs Inflation\n","\n","For some time, Bitcoin has been touted as the ultimate long term favorite as a store of value, something that makes it attractive to investors seeking a more secure means of solving issues of inflation.\n","\n","In fact, current projections show that Bitcoin is indeed a better cushion against inflation than the likes of Gold and the dollar (Going by the estimates of the Federal Reserve with respect to the US economy).\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/andrew-yang-crypto/\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/andrew-yang-crypto/\n","[]\n","2020-02-01 14:05:44+00:00\n","US Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang Says Regulations Cannot Impede Crypto\n","\n","Andrew Yang, who is running for U.S. president in the 2020 election, has explained what his priorities will be regarding cryptocurrency under his administration. He said that crypto investors are finding a way to make use of their investments and regulations cannot impede it. Yang advocates for a uniform, nationwide set of crypto regulations so the U.S. is not stuck with state-by-state policies.\n","\n","Also read: Regulatory Roundup — New US Crypto Tax Bill, Central Banks Join Forces on Digital Currencies\n","\n","Yang’s Crypto Priorities\n","\n","Andrew Yang is an entrepreneur who is running for U.S. president as a Democrat in 2020. In an interview with Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal in Iowa on Wednesday, Yang was asked about his policies in a number of areas, including cryptocurrency, universal basic income (UBI), and the coronavirus.\n","\n","“There is a lot of people who are like really big cryptocurrency fans … they love Andrew Yang,” Weisenthal began. He asked the presidential candidate what he would do under his administration with regard to regulations of the crypto industry, such as bitcoin exchanges. “Do you support the right of people to use their bank accounts, credit cards, etc., to move into cryptocurrencies and other forms of money that aren’t as easily tracked by centralized authorities?” Yang replied:\n","\n","What I would say is that we need to have a uniform set of rules and regulations around cryptocurrency use nationwide because right now we’re stuck with this hodgepodge of state-by-state treatments.\n","\n","Emphasizing that the current way is “bad for everybody,” including innovators who want to invest in the crypto space, Yang declared: “So, that would be my priority … just clear and transparent rules so that everyone knows where they can head in the future and that we can maintain competitiveness.” He believes that the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies has “very, very high potential and we should be investing in it.”\n","\n","An ABC News national poll from Jan. 26 shows Yang in fifth place, with 7% support. He was slightly behind Michael Bloomberg, but well behind Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. However, he was ahead of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.\n","\n","Regulations Cannot Stop Crypto\n","\n","Weisenthal asked Yang during the interview: “Would you support sort of monetary freedom for people that want to move their money away from fiat currencies, get their money out of the banking system into cryptocurrencies?” He elaborated: “Right now, you have banks restricting payments to these platforms and so forth. And people feel like government regulations are essentially impeding in their desire to do that.” Yang responded:\n","\n","Right now people who are investing in these currencies are finding a way to, you know, do so and make use of their investments. No, I don’t think that you could impede it with regulations if you tried.\n","\n","Yang’s Crypto Campaign\n","\n","Yang has been outspoken about his crypto policies for quite some time. On his campaign website, he noted the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies. However, he explained: “A national framework for regulating these assets has failed to emerge, with several federal agencies claiming conflicting jurisdictions. At the same time, states have come up with a patchwork of varying regulations that make it difficult for the U.S. cryptocurrency markets to compete with those in other jurisdictions, especially China and Europe.”\n","\n","He pointed out that different government departments treat cryptocurrency differently, such as property, commodities, or securities. He believes that it is time for the federal government to create clear crypto guidelines, asserting:\n","\n","Cryptocurrency and digital asset markets have developed faster than regulations can keep up. Several states have conflicting and varying regulations on digital asset markets. Uncertainty in what regulatory framework will develop is causing U.S. investment in the area to lag behind the investment of other countries.\n","\n","With clear guidelines, “businesses and individuals can invest and innovate in the area without fear of a regulatory shift,” Yang wrote, reiterating that “Investment in cryptocurrencies and digital assets has far outpaced our regulatory frameworks in the U.S.”\n","\n","What do you think about Andrew Yang’s view on cryptocurrency and him becoming the U.S. president?

More commonly known as fasting, the idea is to abstain from ingesting food for a set amount of time, ranging anywhere from 24 hours to an entire month or beyond. In doing so, proponents hope to improve their bodily health and mental acuity.\n","\n","With nine hours left to my own exercise in self-starvation, I feel neither healthy nor sharp. In fact, I’m pretty sure I’m hallucinating. I’m imagining the taste of last night’s dinner. Fatty salmon. The salt on my tongue. A bed made of arugula. Alas, just cotton sheets and pillow to chew on. My only consolation? I’m not alone.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","I’m skipping meals alongside the Bitcoin Fasting Group, a Telegram channel for crypto-minded people to discuss nutrition, organize fasts and encourage one another through their hunger. Using the predictable pattern of the bitcoin blockchain, which hashes a new set of transactions every 10 minutes, the group schedules 36- to 72-hour communal fasts once in a 2,000-block cycle, or about every two weeks if using a calendar.\n","\n","I joined the channel in the middle of January after seeing a tweet promoting a fast. Beginning at block-height 614,000, a bunch of us (it’s impossible to say how many of the 242 members voluntarily participated) planned to forgo breakfast, lunch and dinner for the sport of it. The fast would start in the middle of the week, and I wanted to test the claims it would improve my productivity.\n","\n","Katie Ananina, the channel’s founder, citizen journalist, and crypto bohemian from Siberia, gave me some pointers before embarking on this extreme – though relatively short – diet. First, don’t expect much; second, like a good Austrian economist, “try to keep a low time preference” (meaning I should value long term gain over short term discomfort).\n","\n","She now sees the fasting group as a parallel conduit to 'hyperbitcoinization'\n","\n","Ananina started fasting after going down the bitcoin rabbit hole in 2017. Once she began questioning the basic tenets of economics (which she studied at St. Petersburg University, before dropping out) her skepticism spread to other areas of her life. She now sees the fasting group as a parallel conduit to “hyperbitcoinization,” as both bitcoin and fasting encourage people to “exercise free will and self-discovery.”\n","\n","“For a subset of the cryptocurrency community, getting interested and invested in this technology meant throwing out orthodoxy about the nature of money and other parts of society,” Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center’s director of communications, said over email. “Including nutrition.”\n","\n","Building blocks\n","\n","Though the process isn’t fully understood, fasting kick-starts a metabolic state called ketosis, where the body burns fat instead of carbohydrates, which has been linked to improved feelings of well-being, increased longevity and something called the best-known nerve growth factor.\n","\n","“There’s a mountain of evidence that has caught on with the trend,” said Dr. Monique Tello, an internist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Tello has become a fasting evangelist after picking up the habit in medical school. She added that the best example may be how the practice has spread organically by word of mouth and on social media. (It’s how I heard of it!)\n","\n","\"Still Life with Peaches and Grapes\" by Auguste Renoir\n","\n","“The internet has allowed alternative theories of nutrition to circulate, with communities forming around them,” Agrawal said. “The more people try it, the more data there will be. If that data looks promising to someone they may try it, too.”\n","\n","Successful accounts of fasts in the crypto community aren’t hard for Tello to imagine. “Our bodies are very well adapted to deal with long periods of less food or no food,” she said. The story goes something like this:\n","\n","Imagine our cave-dwelling ancestors, who hunted and gathered every meal: Their very existence was tied to the precarities of nature. Millennia of living through cycles of bounty and dearth are proof, for some, why human beings are not meant to be in a constant state of digestion.\n","\n","Cave coiners\n","\n","It’s this evolutionary perspective that may explain coiners’ experiments with heterodox diets. “The diet our culture has slipped into, high in added sugars and refined grains, is not good for clear thinking at all,” Tello said.\n","\n","Just as bitcoin seeks a return to a sustainable economic system that challenges modern monetary policy, fasting subverts the received wisdom around “healthy diets” and modern supply chains, which produce foodstuff in total excess. “Beef is to food as bitcoin is to money,” said a member of the bitcoin fasting group, arguing for a ketogenic lifestyle.\n","\n","Ananina encourages members to be self-sovereign and do their own research.\n","\n","The essential nature of a bitcoiner is “someone who can search out valuable information, think critically, and is capable of taking responsibility for their own life, health, and finances,” said Hodlonaut, the astronautical feline Twitter personality and early member of the Bitcoin Fasting Group, in a private message.\n","\n","Hodlonaut was an early member of the channel, and has been experimenting with fasting since 2017, about two years after he discovered bitcoin.\n","\n","The ever-quotable Nic Carter, venture capitalist with Castle Island Ventures, called this phenomenon “epiphany-induced general skepticism.”\n","\n","Stacking fasts\n","\n","That this enlightenment to modernity’s shortcomings has resulted in as deep a skepticism of carbohydrates as central banking has taken the coin community pretty far out.\n","\n","In 2017, it was reported bitcoiners were switching to all-meat diets. The trend led at least one person to eat nothing but meat for two weeks. (For what it’s worth, Teller said carnivorous diets are “hardly sustainable” and “have been associated with high levels of bad cholesterol in the bloodstream,” though could lead to “short-term weight loss.”)\n","\n","A similar spurt of interest has been directed towards fasting. Since October, the Bitcoin Fasting Group has ballooned to more than 250 members, with more joining every day.\n","\n","No matter how someone comes to bitcoin or heterodox diets, proponents of both will likely offer their support. However, this assistance is conditioned on whether the person is able to make their own informed decisions.\n","\n","“Eating a low carbohydrate diet is a good way to prepare for fasting,” said Dr. Jason Fung, author of “The Complete Guide to Fasting,” and frequently cited source in the Telegram channel. “The average weight loss during fasting is 1/2 pound of body fat per day. Total weight loss is often more than this because of water loss.”\n","\n","Ananina encourages members to be self-sovereign and do their own research. “Obviously, feel free to share your experience and ask questions, but the decision is always on you,” she said. Her philosophy is interwoven with the culture of the chat. With every documentary that’s recommended or research report posted, is a comment reminding others to draw their conclusions.\n","\n","Kiernan Wright, former CEO of the Canadian mining company Honey Badger, is also new to the fasting group. I asked him if it seemed cultish to schedule fasts around the bitcoin block schedule. “This is more like a club than a religion, anyone can leave or join at will,” he said. “Bitcoin is a wonderful tool for organizing things, to push the boundaries of what is possible and to do it in a non-violent, non-coercive way, which is crucial to our survival.”\n","https://coingeek.com/police-arrest-10-in-6-6m-israeli-crypto-scam/\n","https://coingeek.com/police-arrest-10-in-6-6m-israeli-crypto-scam/\n","[]\n","2020-02-01 10:00:12+00:00\n","European authorities have arrested 10 suspects accused of defrauding over $6 million from tens of investors. The suspects conducted a crypto pyramid scheme targeting investors in several European countries, including France, Belgium and the U.K. The arrests are the culmination of an extensive investigation that began in 2018.\n","\n","The investigation was led by Europol and Eurojust, EU agencies that focus on law enforcement and criminal justice cooperation respectively. In a press release, Eurojust indicated that the scheme had defrauded 85 investors, mainly from France and Belgium, although it was based in Israel.\n","\n","The scheme targeted its victims by phone, promising them incredible returns of up to 35% for a small investment. In a classic pyramid scheme technique, the fraudsters paid off the initial investors using money raised from late-stage investors. The initial payments led many of the investors to stake more money and recommend the scheme to others.\n","\n","However, after some time, the payments stopped, as they always do. The criminals began to channel all payments into bank accounts belonging to several fake companies in Asian countries and Turkey.\n","\n","Investigations into the crime ring started in 2018, with Eurojust issuing investigation orders to authorities in the U.K., Bulgaria, Spain, Hungary, Portugal and the Czech Republic to assist with the investigations. In January last year, the authorities made the first arrests, bringing in four suspects arrested in France. Europol also partnered with authorities in Luxembourg to seize $1.1 million.\n","\n","This is the latest case of crypto fraudsters being brought to book. In January alone, tens of crypto fraudsters have faced the law in connection to millions of dollars lost through crypto scams. The DoJ, for instance, recently charged two alleged fraudsters for using fake identities to raise over $30 million in an ICO. The two were behind CG Blockchain, a company that claimed to develop blockchain auditing tools.\n","\n","The SEC, on the other hand, charged ICOBox with the issuing of an unregistered ICO in which it raised $14 million. Just days prior, it had charged a San Diego, California man for defrauding $3.5 million from investors in a cloud mining scam.\n","\n","The law enforcement actions are a positive sign for the crypto industry as it indicates the authorities are cracking down on the rampant crypto scams.

Martinez']\n","2020-02-02 20:09:14+00:00\n","Share this article\n","\n","Bitcoin is sitting at a make-or-break point. This coming week BTC will decide whether to continue its bullish trend or pullback.\n","\n","A Pivotal Point on Bitcoin’s Trend\n","\n","Bitcoin entered a bull rally on Jan. 3 that has seen its price rise by nearly 40%. The flagship cryptocurrency went from trading at a low $6,900 to a high of $9,550 on Jan. 30. Since the peak, BTC began a consolidation phase without a clear sign of where it is heading next.\n","\n","According to Josh Rager, a cryptocurrency trader and the co-founder of Blockroots, the recent price rejection off of the $9,500 resistance level could trigger a steep correction. A spike in the selling pressure behind BTC could push its price down to $8,800 or $8,700 before the bullish trend continues.\n","\n","Rager believes that a break below this support level could cause panic among investors, sending Bitcoin down to $8,000 or $7,900.\n","\n","Despite Rager’s assessment of a retracement, Big Chonis, a stock and cryptocurrency trader with over 10 years of experience, argues that “the weekly chart paints a different picture.” Chonis maintains that a weekly close above the $9,500 resistance level would be “very bullish” for Bitcoin.\n","\n","Breaking this significant price barrier could send investors into a stage of FOMO (fear-of-missing-out). The pioneer cryptocurrency could surge quickly to the next level of resistance given by the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level, according to Chonis. This resistance level sits at $11,520.\n","\n","The ambiguity about the fate of Bitcoin can be seen throughout the entire crypto market. As a result, the trading range between $9,260 and $9,500 is a reasonable no-trade zone. Moving below support would likely take BTC to the 78.6% or 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Conversely, closing above resistance could allow this crypto to test the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $10,400.\n","\n","Overall Market Sentiment\n","\n","Based on the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, investors appear to be overwhelmingly bullish about Bitcoin. In fact, this technical index is sensing high levels of greed among market participants over the past few days. Greed is usually perceived as a negative sign, which indicates that a selling opportunity could present itself soon. As Warren Buffett once said, “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”\n","https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-bitcoin-emoji/\n","https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-bitcoin-emoji/\n","['Bhushan Akolkar', 'Benjamin Godfrey', 'Kofi Ansah']\n","2020-02-02 10:26:23+00:00\n","Bitcoin emoji is now on Twitter. This is the first time that any platform has approved this symbol as an emoji. However, the BTC sign was approved as a Unicode symbol in 2017.\n","\n","Twitter’s Bitcoin emoji has been introduced. This has generated lots of excitement within the crypto space. Twitter’s cryptocurrency community has been on fire as the Bitcoin symbol has been trending. However, it could have been rather expectable. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has been known to be a Bitcoin fan for many years now. His recent tweet has got a lot of positive feedbacks.\n","\n","The Bitcoin symbol was approved as a Unicode symbol in 2017. This is the first time that any platform is approving the symbol as an emoji. It also indicates that Bitcoin is becoming part of popular culture. The Bitcoin emoji appears when the bitcoin hashtag is used. This has been hailed by many in the crypto space as a welcome development. Many fear that the crypto space is still young. This, of course, has led to concerns regarding market manipulation. Others have pointed to Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto space. This has set such people on the edge. They are concerned about the general acceptance of altcoins.\n","\n","Many notable cryptocurrency experts have decided to keep the fire burning. Changpeng Zhao of Binance indicated this in a recent tweet.\n","\n","It is uncertain who encouraged the addition of Bitcoin to Twitter’s emoji list. This hasn’t dampened the enthusiasm. Being a first, many have remained speculative as to its effect on Bitcoin prices. Some are still concerned about the sideways trend that Bitcoin is going through currently. Others want this move to drive Bitcoin prices up. Hodlers generally are in favor of the latter. There is a higher possibility of rising Bitcoin prices. The Bitcoin halving event is coming in a few months. Moves like this are slated to push prices higher than normal.\n","\n","Bitcoin Emoji Will Improve Adoption Chances\n","\n","Added to rising demand, this will be a win for the crypto space. It also improves the chances of adoption by newbies to the community. Hashtagging could be a powerful tool in doing this. Twitter adding Bitcoin to its emoji list may not go down well with regulators. This is a grey area for many. The U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has specifically classified Bitcoin as a commodity. One thing is certain: Bitcoin is gaining ground.\n","\n","This is a public relations victory for the crypto space. Twitter is known to charge up to $1 million for the creation of emojis on its platform. Jack Dorsey’s announcement has created a new paradigm for the cryptocurrency. It places Bitcoin among one of the world’s top brands. Over 35,000 tweets have placed the hashtag in top twitter trends globally. This will change the way many view Bitcoin.\n","\n","At the time of filing, this report Bitcoin (BTC) prices stood at $9,389.23.

That allows you to have the flexibility to focus on managing risks of what’s new in this space.”\n","\n","Pitcher hopes to create a system that allows Bermudians to spend the digital currency they receive on government services and, in so doing, build a bridge to overseas economies.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","“By allowing the government to accept it, it provides an opportunity for merchants to start saying, ‘Well, I can look at accepting digital dollars,’” he said. “So taxi operators, tourism operators, commercial businesses have a place to actually spend, which means that you’re not going to have to fall back to the traditional financial system.”\n","\n","Pitcher hopes these systems will finally introduce ordinary Bermudians into the global financial ecosystem.\n","\n","“Our history allows us to really understand financial services,” he said. “But the challenge that comes from this is that when it comes to access to financial services, Bermudians are largely excluded.

This is the first time a cryptocurrency question has been included in the tax form. The IRS expects more than 150 million filers to reveal whether they acquired or disposed of any cryptocurrencies during the tax year.\n","\n","Also read: Regulatory Roundup — New US Crypto Tax Bill, Central Banks Join Forces on Digital Currencies\n","\n","IRS Kicks Off Tax Season\n","\n","The IRS kicked off this year’s tax filing season last week with tips on how to file the 2019 tax returns. The deadline for filing and paying any tax owed is Wednesday, April 15. The agency expects more than 150 million individual tax returns to be filed.\n","\n","Among the changes to the 2019 Form 1040, the main U.S. tax form, is the addition of “an inquiry regarding the acquisition or disposition of any virtual currency,” the agency explained. The new crypto question appears on Form 1040’s Schedule 1, entitled “Additional Income and Adjustments to Income.”\n","\n","“Virtual currency is an important addition to the 1040 this year,” IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig commented. “This emerging area is a priority for the IRS, and we want to help taxpayers understand their obligations involving virtual currency. We will also take steps to ensure fair enforcement of the tax laws for those who don’t follow the rules involving virtual currency.” The tax agency elaborated:\n","\n","In 2019, taxpayers who engaged in a transaction involving virtual currency will need to file Schedule 1 … The Internal Revenue Code and regulations require taxpayers to maintain records that support the information provided on tax returns.\n","\n","The IRS clarified that taxpayers must keep records of “receipts, sales, exchanges or other dispositions of virtual currency and the fair market value of the virtual currency.” It further noted that taxpayers who did not engage in any crypto transactions in 2019 do not have to file Schedule 1 for this purpose. However, if they are already filing Schedule 1 for other non-crypto purposes, then check the “no” box for the crypto question.\n","\n","Reporting Crypto Income\n","\n","According to the instructions for Schedule 1, a transaction involving cryptocurrency includes “The receipt or transfer of virtual currency for free (without providing any consideration), including from an airdrop or following a hard fork; an exchange of virtual currency for goods or services; a sale of virtual currency; and an exchange of virtual currency for other property, including for another virtual currency.”\n","\n","The agency explained that if a taxpayer received any cryptocurrencies as compensation for services or disposed of any coins held for sale to customers in a trade or business, they must report the income as they would report other income of the same type. For example, W-2 wages are reported on line 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Some are reported on Schedule C. Form 8949 will help with figuring out capital gain or loss, which will then be reported on Schedule D of Form 1040.\n","\n","IRS Publication 525, entitled “Taxable and Nontaxable Income,” states:\n","\n","If your employer gives you virtual currency (such as bitcoin) as payment for your services, you must include the FMV [fair market value] of the currency in your income.\n","\n","“The FMV of virtual currency paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding, Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) tax, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) tax and must be reported on Form W-2,” the IRS emphasized.\n","\n","The agency has provided two sets of guidance and FAQs on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies. The first guidance was issued in 2014 and the second in October 2019. The latter focuses largely on hard forks and airdrops. News.Bitcoin.com has also published a list of useful tax tools to help crypto owners.\n","\n","Crypto Is ‘An Important Focal Point for the IRS in 2020’\n","\n","In its Progress Update for the fiscal year 2019 published in January, the IRS explained that cryptocurrency is among the new and emerging compliance areas requiring its attention. Along with enforcement activities, it is providing outreach and education in these areas.\n","\n","In 2019, the tax agency sent letters to more than 10,000 crypto owners suspected of possibly failing to report their crypto transactions properly, it detailed, adding that “The letters explained the tax obligations associated with virtual currency and describe how taxpayers can correct past filing and reporting errors.” Noting that “Voluntarily compliant taxpayers deserve to know that noncompliant taxpayers are at risk,” the agency declared:\n","\n","Virtual currency, also called cryptocurrency, will remain an important focal point for the IRS in 2020.\n","\n","What do you think of the IRS’ crypto tax strategy?

But, this financial trend is changing, with there being banks that now charge consumers and businesses for storing money, something unheard of ten or twenty years ago.\n","\n","This trend of money being expensive to hold could prove the value of Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and blockchain-based financial services that disincentivize certain behaviors.\n","\n","ING forces negative interest rates on wealthy clients\n","\n","Since the Great Recession of 2008, central banks have started to act in ways seemingly irrational compared to their traditional practices. These institutions have started pumping copious amounts of money into the economy through quantitative easing (or ” large-scale asset purchases”) and by decreasing interest rates, which are now at the lowest they’ve been at seemingly ever.\n","\n","In some countries, the interest rate is effectively 0 percent, in other places, it’s a negative amount, meaning that certain lenders pay the borrower.\n","\n","This is the case in the Netherlands, where the official long-term interest rate is -0.14 percent, per data from YCharts.\n","\n","Banks, of course, have had to adjust for this. ING, one of the largest Dutch banks, revealed at the end of January that it will be charging an interest rate of -0.5 percent for wealthy clients with more than 1 million euros in their account. This will come into effect for businesses from April 1st and for private customers on July 1st. ING chalked up this move to the Netherland’s low rates:\n","\n","“Due to persistent low and negative interest rates in the market.”\n","\n","Second Dutch bank (ING) charges negative rates on savings account. – O.5 % on everything above €1 million euros. pic.twitter.com/vhkb9OZuk0 — VoimaGold.com (@JanGold_) February 1, 2020\n","\n","Only 6,400 customers, the bank claims, will be affected by this move, but as rates have been decreasing for years now, it may be a precursor of what may come for mom and pop consumers.\n","\n","Indeed, the bank confirmed that savings interest for accounts with a balance of up to 100,000 euros will receive a jaw-dropping (I’m kidding) 0.01 percent — effectively nothing. Zilch. Na da.\n","\n","Enter Bitcoin, Crypto, DeFi\n","\n","Enter Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n","\n","DeFi, arguably, is the easiest way to shoehorn crypto into the world of no yield on bank deposits.\n","\n","Below is an image from LoanScan.io, a service that tracks platforms that offer loans of digital assets on Ethereum-based platforms and centralized platforms. As can be seen in the table, users can earn an interest rate of anywhere from 1.5 percent to 24 percent a year (rates are variable) by lending stablecoins and even Ethereum to platforms like dYdX, Compound, or Dharma.\n","\n","Some services even allow clients in the U.S. to use their bank cards to deposit money directly into DeFi, lowering the barrier of entry to high-yielding Ethereum-based investment or savings opportunities.\n","\n","There are also centralized solutions that help you put your crypto to good use, like the Galaxy Digital-funded BlockFi or Nexo, which both offer around an 8 percent interest rate on stablecoins that can be claimed for U.S. dollars.\n","\n","If you don’t trust decentralized finance, which is admittedly currently in its earliest stages and thus open to attack vectors in the code, there’s also the option of mitigating negative interest rates by simply holding Bitcoin in a cold storage solution, safe from the hackers of the world.\n","\n","Yes, Bitcoin doesn’t offer any yield and inflates with time, just like cash, but analysts say that it is becoming digital gold, so to speak, or a digital store of value that should theoretically hold its value over long swaths of time.\n","\n","Banks are turning to crypto\n","\n","The funny thing about all this is, the world’s banks and financial institutions are slowly turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ING included. Whether or not this is them acknowledging that the time of fiat is ending because of low interest rates isn’t clear, though.\n","\n","ING, for instance, was revealed by Reuters to have started work on a crypto custody project. The company purportedly has other blockchain-related initiatives too, though details about those are scant.\n","\n","Similarly, Fidelity Investments has launched a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trade execution and custody service for its institutional clients who hold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of wealth.\n","\n","Banks turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a sign that they see a large amount of potential in this industry. Yet, it is somewhat antithetical to Bitcoin’s premise to be a decentralized, peer-to-peer movement.\n","\n","Get an edge on the cryptoasset market Access more crypto insights and context in every article as a paid member of CryptoSlate Edge.

But only crypto lets people “take back control for real,” as the advertisement read. The billboard was put up Friday for 24 hours.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","“We find it amusing that the same sentence, taking back control, can mean two different things,” Gauthier said in a phone call. “It’s a great moment to frame one of bitcoin’s taglines as an effective way to take back control over your money, digital secrets, and private key.”\n","\n","The billboard is meant to challenge the nativism behind Brexit’s success. “Brexit means taking back control over borders and currency. It’s very U.K.-centric. Bitcoin is the opposite. It’s a borderless, global technology,” Gauthier said.\n","\n","\"Millions of people can't be wrong. Unless they're British.\"\n","\n","The executive is waiting to see how Brexit’s trade deals will affect his company going forward. Ledger opened a U.K. operation last quarter and employs several people in London, though does not have “a physical office at this time.”\n","\n","Crypto exchange Bitpanda took a harder line on the U.K.’s departure.\n","\n","“Personally, I think Brexit is a mistake,” said Eric Demuth, the Vienna-based co-CEO and founder. “I feel like many people do not see the great impact and were misled by the personal short-term goals of some politicians. No self-promoting politician should be a reason for anyone to be stripped of their freedoms.”\n","\n","Ledger's ad.\n","\n","Making light of this alleged political grift, Bitpanda shelled out for a multi-day advertising campaign reminding viewers that “millions of people can’t be wrong.”\n","\n","“Unless they’re British.”\n","\n","The admonishment will hang at “The Screen” in Canary Wharf and three other London locations, on 38 installations throughout Glasgow, Scotland and throughout the Belgium capital of Brussels.\n","\n","“We want to provoke people to think about the impact their vote has on their lives,” Demuth said.\n","\n","Peter McCormack, a prominent crypto commenter based in England, called the sign “hypocritical” and said “real bitcoiners would probably support Brexit.” For his part, McCormack said he supports the divorce in theory, though he recognizes the alliance forged in 1973 has helped keep the peace in Europe.\n","\n","“I don’t feel anything, it’s a total anticlimax. I don’t want to celebrate leaving,” McCormack said on a call.\n","\n","Ivis Buric, a Bitpanda representative, said the company received a “copy denial from media owners in London,” who rejected the political nature of the advertisement. “Thankfully, there is still freedom of speech and advertising rules so we are live on location,” Buric said.\n","\n","Bitpanda’s media campaign began Thursday night, and Buric said the company is happy with the response from the community.

A cryptocurrency advocate since 2010, Evan has years of experience working as a software engineer in fintech before leaving his corporate job to pursue a full-time venture in the cryptocurrency and digital asset space.\n","\n","Cryptocurrency exchanges process hundreds of millions of dollars worth of trades every day for millions of traders across the world. Most of us know how to fund our accounts and place orders to buy or sell the assets that we want, but do you really know how exchanges and order books work? Having an understanding of the mechanics behind order books can be a useful tool for traders to quickly assess a market and see what other traders are doing and thinking.\n","\n","So What Is an Order Book?\n","\n","If you view a market on an exchange, most of the time you’re shown a candlestick chart, an order book table and a depth chart. Candlestick charts allow us to see past trading activity, whereas order books and depth charts let us see a glimpse into the future and the minds of other traders at that current point in time. See the screenshot below from the Coinbase Pro BTC-USD market view, with the order order book on the left highlighted.\n","\n","The order book is a real-time list of all outstanding orders that have been placed by other traders but haven’t yet been filled. That means that for every entry in the order book, there is one or more other traders with an open order for that exact price and amount. On the top in red are all of the open asks, or prices that that other sellers are asking for, and below in green are all of the open bids, or prices that other buyers are bidding to buy at.\n","\n","Because these are all open orders, they let us see the prices that other people think they can get their orders filled at. This gives us an idea of where the market might go in the near future and what prices other people are speculating that the asset might be worth.\n","\n","Those other traders have locked their funds up in these orders, meaning that if they have a buy order for 0.1 BTC at a rate of $9,000, that trader has $900 dedicated to that order that can’t be traded or transferred elsewhere. They’re putting their money on the line, so you can be sure that they are likely confident that the price will move in the direction they’ve predicted.\n","\n","What Happens When You Place an Order?\n","\n","Now that we have a basic understanding of what an order book is, let’s go through an example of what happens when you place two different types of orders, a market order and a limit order.\n","\n","Market Orders\n","\n","A market order is a simple type of order that will be executed immediately at the current market price. This doesn’t allow you to speculate about any specific price, you’re just buying or selling immediately at whatever the best available price is. As soon as you submit the order your trade will occur.\n","\n","So how does the exchange know how to give you the best available price? It does this by using the order book. Let’s use the following example of a BTC-USD order book.\n","\n","We can see that at this moment the lowest ask selling price by another trader is $8,900 (they’re looking to sell 1.5 BTC), and the highest bid buying price is $8,890. The last price, which is the price that the latest order on this market filled at recently, is $8,900. Let’s see what happens when we place a market order to buy 2 BTC.\n","\n","The exchange is going to start at the ask order with the lowest price and fill that first, in order to ensure you get the best possible price. So you will buy all of the 1.5 BTC being sold for $8,900, but you placed an order for 2 BTC so there is still 0.5 BTC left in your order.\n","\n","Since you filled the order for 1.5 at $8,900 (and some trader walked away with $13,350 given a price that they were happy to sell 1.5 BTC for), the exchange will now move on to the ask order with the next lowest price. Looking at the order book, we can see that is now the order selling 0.6 BTC at a rate of $8,950. Since you have 0.5 BTC left in your order, you will buy 0.5 of that 0.6 BTC, leaving 0.1 still open on the order book. Below is a demonstration of those orders by other traders that you will fill:\n","\n","And here is what the order book will look like after your order is complete (although in the real world traders and trading bots are constantly submitting new orders, so the order book can potentially be updating tens or hundreds of times per second on an active market):\n","\n","At this point we’ve purchased the 2 BTC that we wanted. We purchased 1.5 BTC at $8,900, and 0.5 BTC at $8,950, giving us a total cost of (8900 * 1.5) + (8950 * .5) which equals $17,825. If we average the two orders, we bought at an average rate of $8,912.50. The last price has now changed to $8,950 since that was the price of the latest order that you filled.\n","\n","Limit Orders\n","\n","A limit order is another type of order that is a bit more sophisticated than a market order. Unlike market orders, which just buy or sell at whatever the best possible rate is immediately, limit orders allow traders to specify a price that they want to buy or sell at, allowing them to speculate on what the price may be in the future. For example, a buying bid limit order for BTC at rate of $9,000 will only execute at a price of $9,000 or better (lower). In contrast, a selling ask limit order will for BTC at a rate of $9,100 will only execute at a price of $9,100 or better (higher).\n","\n","Limit orders have their advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that you get to specify the price you want. The disadvantages are that there’s no guarantee the order will ever be filled (if the price never reaches that point then it can’t ever be filled), that your money or coins will be locked up in this order (you won’t be able to use it for anything else), and that there’s no guarantee your entire order will be filled. You might have placed a limit order to buy 0.5 BTC, but only end up buying 0.3 BTC.\n","\n","For this example we’ll use the same order book that we started with previously:\n","\n","Say your order is to buy 1 BTC with a bid limit order at a price of $8,800. Since the current lowest ask selling price is $8,900 (which is above $8,800) your order will not be filled because the price hasn’t reached the level that you want. So your order will be inserted into the order book like below.\n","\n","If the price does eventually reach $8,800 by other people filling the higher priced bid orders, for example if someone placed a market order to sell 4.5 BTC (0.5 + 1 + 3, the sizes of the open bid orders at prices higher than yours in the order book), then your order will now be the highest priced bid.\n","\n","At that point, if someone were to place a market sell order your buy order for 1 BTC would be the first order that the exchange would fill. If that other trader’s market order were for less than your total order amount, say a market sell order for 0.4 BTC, your order would remain in the order book with 0.6 BTC left to be filled.\n","\n","Gaining Insights by Analyzing Order Books\n","\n","That was a lot of information but I hope you now have a better understanding of what’s going on behind the scenes at an exchange when you place an order. The above examples are simplified to demonstrate the high level concepts of what an exchange does, but they should provide you a basic enough comprehension to now be able to understand how we can gain some helpful insights by looking at an order book.\n","\n","Depth Charts\n","\n","A depth chart is a very common way to visualize an order book. Let’s look at this example, again from the Coinbase Pro BTC-USD market:\n","\n","This shows all of the open orders, bid buy orders are on the left in green and ask sell orders are on the right in red. The x-axis below the chart shows the price, and the y-axis on the left and right sides is the total cumulative number of BTC locked up in orders.\n","\n","For each order (or price level if multiple orders exist at the same price) that is found in the order book, the depth chart adds that order’s amount (size) to the y-axis, increasing its height at that order’s price on the x-axis. So each increase in height that you see represents a single entry in the order book, meaning a larger increase in height means there is a larger amount in an order at that price.\n","\n","If we hover over the bid portion of the chart at the 200 point on the y-axis, we see this:\n","\n","This shows us that between the current last price of $9,020.10 and the price of $8,947.97, there are a number of different orders that in total contain ~200 BTC (the y-axis value at our cursor). It also shows us that in order to move the price down to $8,947.97 one would have to sell $1,991,329.63 worth of BTC, since that would fill every order between that and the last price.\n","\n","Buy Walls and Sell Walls\n","\n","A more interesting example of a depth chart is when we see a buy wall or a sell wall. By searching through the markets on Coinbase Pro I was able to find an example of a buy wall on the XLM-EUR market, see the screenshot below:\n","\n","In comparison to the BTC-USD depth chart we looked at previously, which had a fairly constant upwards slope on both sides, this chart shows sharp increases in height. On the left bid side we see a large vertical increase at €0.0540 on the x-axis.\n","\n","That means that there is a significant amount of money tied up in open buy orders at the price of €0.0540, so once the price reaches that level it could potentially take dozens or hundreds of other traders placing sell orders at that price to completely fill that order and move the price past that order’s price level. These walls provide an indicator that this could be a potential area of resistance, as it will take a comparatively large amount of money to move past that price point in the order book.\n","\n","Order Book Superiority\n","\n","Another helpful tool for assessing an order book is order book superiority analysis, such as that available in the Coygo application. Below is an screenshot of Coygo’s order book superiority analysis for the same Coinbase Pro BTC-USD market:\n","\n","In this example, order book superiority is analyzing all open orders in the order book within 5% of the last price. This is done to avoid outliers and provide an analysis of the orders that have potential to be relevant in the near future.\n","\n","On the left we can see that all bids with a rate within 5% of the last price are shown to have a cumulative total amount of 907.1201 BTC, with 798 different entries in the order book, which is 60.82% of the total amount of all orders (bids and asks combined) within the price range. On the right, all asks with a rate within 5% of the last price add up to a total amount of 584.2782 BTC, with 1347 entries in the order book, which is 39.18% of the total amount of all orders within the price range.\n","\n","In the center we see that the total amount of BTC in all bids and asks combined is 1,491.3984 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $11,834,410.7533 given the current last price. Below that we see two horizontal bars representing the total amount of BTC locked up in bid orders in the green horizontal bar and ask orders in the red horizontal bar, and finally below that it shows that the order book superiority favors bids with a difference of 21.64% between the total cumulative amount of BTC locked up in bids compared to asks.\n","\n","We can learn a number of things from this simplified visualization of the order book. The most obvious is that at this exact moment, traders are committing more money to buy orders than sell orders. This can show us that there may be more sentiment by traders thinking the price might go down to a lower price since they’re hoping to buy, but it can also be deceiving as perhaps only one very wealthy trader placed a larger sized order. That appears to be the case in this example, if we look at the number of entries we see that although there is 21.64% more BTC locked up in bids than asks, the total number of bid order book entries is much smaller, 798 compared to 1347 for asks.\n","\n","Combining the two tools above, depth charts and order book superiority analysis, can provide a very quick but detailed assessment of the current state of a market’s order book. This in turn can tell you where other traders think the price might be moving, how much money is being committed by other traders at certain price levels, where areas of resistance might exist, and even if a market is potentially being manipulated by a small number of very wealthy traders.\n","\n","This has just been a basic introduction to how order books operate on cryptocurrency exchanges and how you can read and visualize them to gain insights that put you at an advantage over others who don’t have as good of an understanding of how markets work. Good luck trading!\n","\n","Featured image via Unsplash.\n","02/03/2020\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&tbm=nws&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/03/2020,cd_max:02/03/2020,sbd:1&sa=X&hl=en&gl=us&as_drrb=b&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&gbv=1&sei=XtqhYKjeMIWD9PwPn4S_6Ag\n","None\n","https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/181196?hl=en\n","None\n","https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiohcTy2s_wAhWFAZ0JHR_CD40QPAgI\n","#\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiohcTy2s_wAhWFAZ0JHR_CD40Q_AUIDigA\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/03/2020,cd_max:02/03/2020,sbd:1&tbm=bks&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiohcTy2s_wAhWFAZ0JHR_CD40Q_AUIECgC\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/03/2020,cd_max:02/03/2020&tbm=vid&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiohcTy2s_wAhWFAZ0JHR_CD40Q_AUIESgD\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/03/2020,cd_max:02/03/2020&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiohcTy2s_wAhWFAZ0JHR_CD40Q_AUIEigE\n","/preferences\n","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-potentially-profitable-cryptocurrencies-100627541.html\n","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-potentially-profitable-cryptocurrencies-100627541.html\n","[]\n","None\n","Cryptocurrency is a potentially great digital asset for investment.

Bitcoin\n","\n","In May 2020, the first and major cryptocurrency developers will offer 50% reduced rewards – 6.25 BTC instead of 12.5 BTC for each verified block. However, apart from that, Bitcoin is likely to bring the dominance index to 65-70% compared to other altcoins. In such a way, it can become the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization. These factors may significantly affect the growth of its price in 2020. Active use of Lightning Network may also change the BTC ecosystem. It will enable the implementation of Bitcoin in decentralized applications, micropayments, and e-commerce platforms. The current Bitcoin price (January 28, 2020) is $8 994,85.\n","\n","2. Ethereum\n","\n","Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is based on practical smart contracts used by many projects for the digitalization of transactions. The currency value may increase due to the increasing demand for its blockchain and functions, rather than a deficit of the asset as it happens with BTC right now. A major role in the success or failure of this currency will depend on upcoming fork updates and rapid implementation of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm. The approval by regulatory organizations and community decision to de-list ETH from the list of altcoins may also affect its price growth in 2020. The current ETH price is $171,38.\n","\n","3. NEO\n","\n","The NEO project is often included in different cryptocurrency investment ratings for the next year. This cryptocurrency breaks many stereotypes, including being the first open-source token originated from China. It claims to transform the traditional financial system by combining digital and real assets. Its unique Superconduct trading mechanism allows users to trust the funds through a decentralized platform. So, NEO’s appliance is beyond doubt, as its rapid demand growth. NEO may even hold an ICO, but so far it is trading at the level of $11,14 USD per token. The current NEO price is $11,14.\n","\n","4. EOS\n","\n","Chinese experts, according to CoinTelegraph, really like to include EOS to the list of the most promising cryptocurrencies for the next few years. Even if you don’t know much about crypto coins, it is definitely worth your investment in 2020. If Twitter, Uber, and Amazon ever move to a blockchain, the core of their work will definitely be EOS. The EOS system is free of Ethereum problems with scalability and it is ready to replace other competitive blockchains. If Ethereum fails, EOS can level up to 100 USD per token. EOS achievements become possible thanks to the consensus algorithm of delegated proof of ownership (DPoS) and an infinite number of similar blockchains. The current EOS price is $3,94.\n","\n","5. Ripple\n","\n","Some experts call XRP the “king of banking infrastructure”. The successful partnership with major financial market players made the Ripple ecosystem a breakthrough in the crypto industry. Take the latest integration with Western Union and the potential replacement of SWIFT to accelerate and reduce the cost of large money transfers between counterparties. However, do not expect huge profits with XRP in 2020, it is good for long-term investment. Even with the most optimistic approach, XRP price is unlikely to rise above 0.7 USD in the next couple of years. The current XRP price is $0,233759.\n","\n","Source: https://i0.wp.com/www.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/coins.jpg?resize=775%2C450&ssl=1\n","\n","Cheap but potentially good for investment cryptocurrencies in 2020\n","\n","Besides the obvious choices of popular cryptocurrencies, one of AMarkets experts – Basil Gamov – recommends to take a closer look at cheap but potentially great cryptocurrencies to invest in the next 12 months:\n","\n","1) Chainlink (LINK) – appeared in 2017 in the USA. These crypto coins developed a technology that forms channels between different data providers employing smart blockchain technology. Chainlink allows all network operators, like information providers, to earn their token LINK. From an investment point of view, Chainlink has great potential. This is the list of partners who also believe in this crypto coin’s future: Dapps Inc, Google Cloud, ETHA, ConsenSys. The price (January 28, 2020) is $2,62. The market cap is $917 350 826.\n","\n","2) Basic Attention Token (BAT) is another functional type of tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is used only in the Brave browser. The cryptocurrency was launched in 2015. Developers offer a various concept of interaction for all network participants. Browser users pick to choose ads or not and can monitor the token’s price in real-time via Brave. The token has a very active and massive affiliate program, has the support of the Tor browser and DuckDuckGo search engine. The current token price is $0,218456. The market cap is $311 019 624.\n","\n","3) Synthetix Network Token (SNX) is a potentially interesting platform network based on the ERC20 token. It helps to create synthetic assets (Synths) for tracking the value of physical assets. People can create and support their Synths and make money with them, without actually being the owners of these assets. The token appeared in 2017 and back then it was called Havven.

Payments are made across a network of such accounts and only the setting up and closing of the accounts is registered on the blockchain.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","This can result in payments that are far faster and more scalable than those made directly on the blockchain, and is touted as a way to make crypto payments more feasible in bricks-and-mortar stores. Bitcoin transactions, for example, currently take on average roughly 11 minutes to be confirmed on the network, though the figure has sometimes peaked at over 15 minutes. Lightning is said to take from milliseconds to seconds, by contrast.\n","\n","According to a CSAIL report on Spider, PCNs can be slowed by inefficient routing schemes, and often quickly run down users’ accounts, meaning they are forced to top up their funds frequently.\n","\n","Spider is claimed to be a more efficient way of routing payments, in which participants can invest just a fraction of funds in their account. It’s also said to be able to process around four times the number of transactions, compared with other PCNs, before registering the events on the blockchain.\n","\n","Spider works by splitting transactions into smaller amounts or “packets” that propagate over different channels at varying rates, CSAIL writes. By dividing the amounts into bite-sized chunks, large payments can be routed through accounts that may have low funding levels. Unlike with other systems that will send the full payment and possibly be rejected by accounts with insufficient funds – thus causing delays as the transaction is rerouted – Spider can produce payments that are less likely to clog up the network or fail, its team say.\n","\n","“Routing money in a way that the funds of both users in each joint account are balanced allows us to reuse the same initial funds to support as many transactions as possible,” Sivaraman said.\n","\n","The routing system was inspired by packet switching, a method of efficiently transmitting data over the web.\n","\n","Another feature of the tech is it allows payments to be queued at congested accounts rather than being rejected, while the team also built an algorithm they say can help spot congested accounts.\n","\n","In tests looking at how it handles one-directional payments where an account becomes depleted and needs to be topped up on the blockchain, the team says Spider can also outperform other PCN systems.\n","\n","The researchers aim to present a paper on Spider at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation later this month.\n","\n","“It’s important to have balanced, high-throughput routing in PCNs to ensure the money that users put into joint accounts is used efficiently,” said lead author Sivaraman. “This should be efficient and a lucrative business. That means routing as many transactions as possible, with as little funds as possible, to give PCNs the best bang for their buck.”\n","https://cryptobriefing.com/dont-call-chinas-digital-currency-crypto-project/\n","https://cryptobriefing.com/dont-call-chinas-digital-currency-crypto-project/\n","['Ashwath Balakrishnan']\n","2020-02-03 14:14:03+00:00\n","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.\n","\n","Share this article\n","\n","China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) has been shrouded in mystery. Some have labeled the development as a tracking tool for an authoritarian government. Others have been more generous.\n","\n","Both groups can, however, agree on one point: it’s nothing like Bitcoin.\n","\n","Don’t Call it a Cryptocurrency\n","\n","A recent document found by a Chinese think tank suggests that the People’s Bank of China will track customer fund flow and use big data analytics to collect and process large amounts of transactional information passing through the database.\n","\n","Although they claim to preserve user privacy in the process, the document clearly outlines that the commercial partners have the ability to track cash flows within the scope of their own users.\n","\n","While it isn’t mentioned in the document, the very existence of such a system means the central bank has access to the entire system, just as the central bank of any country can track remittances back to a particular user within their country.\n","\n","Matthew Graham, CEO of Sino Global Capital, an investment firm focused on blockchain technologies in Asia, told Crypto Briefing in an email that calling the DCEP a data scraping project is “misleading.”\n","\n","Instead, said Graham, “one could argue that the DCEP represents the next era of central banking, where monetary policy decisions are increasingly based on detailed real-time information.”\n","\n","This could help policymakers in the country make better decisions.\n","\n","Chinese authorities will analyze payment behavior to gain a better understanding of currency circulation in the economy, as well as track down and weed out potential money launderers. A side effect of this is centralized control of the network.\n","\n","This feature is also in line with how China operates politically. Whenever the country begins to pursue an objective, “their top-down structure ensures that the regulatory and legal path is clear and plans are executed rapidly,” said Graham.\n","\n","Moreover, the central bank has publicly accepted this is a closed system, drawing on the example of Bitcoin to differentiate between a decentralized digital currency and centrally-managed currency.\n","\n","Graham said that this decision was likely due to blockchain technology’s inability to scale. He added:\n","\n","“Given this structure, it is not accurate to call it a cryptocurrency, even though it was announced that the DCEP wallets would likely employ distributed tech and public-private key cryptography when setting up user accounts. Thus it is important to distinguish between a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and a digital currency such as DCEP.”\n","\n","Many new features have been included in the currency’s design, including anti-spam protection and offline transactions. The central bank is likely to roll out a dedicated wallet, either independently or through its commercial banking partners.\n","\n","Issuance will be solely at the discretion of the People’s Bank of China.

This new digital currency aims to replace coins, banknotes, and other money equivalents that can easily be converted to cash with this new digital currency.\n","\n","If this happens, financial privacy in the country will be under further attack as one of the remaining private forms of money ⁠— cash ⁠— is eliminated from the system.\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin-paypal/\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin-paypal/\n","[]\n","2020-02-04 01:35:14+00:00\n","How To Buy Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies Using Paypal\n","\n","These days there are myriad ways people can purchase cryptocurrencies, and the payment platform Paypal is a popular choice. Multiple crypto brokerage services and exchanges allow people to buy digital currencies with the payment option. The following post is a simple guide and list of exchanges that support Paypal payments so you can get started buying crypto with the service.\n","\n","Also Read: How To Start Using Bitcoin: Buying, Storing, and Spending Crypto\n","\n","Buying Cryptos With Paypal\n","\n","The cryptocurrency ecosystem is 11 years old and there are more ways than ever to purchase and obtain cryptocurrencies in 2020. Some trading platforms allow users to pay with debit and credit cards and with bank transfers as well. But there’s also a slew of businesses that allow people to purchase bitcoin and other cryptos with the Paypal payment processor.\n","\n","In order to make your first cryptocurrency purchase by leveraging Paypal, you obviously need a Paypal account. You also need to register with a trading platform or brokerage service that sells digital currencies like BTC, BCH, and ETH with Paypal. There’s a good number of services that allow users to pay for their cryptos with the payment provider. Lastly, you will also need a cryptocurrency wallet that supports the digital asset you want to purchase. Bitcoin.com’s wallet is an excellent noncustodial wallet solution that allows you to store, send, and receive both BTC and BCH.\n","\n","Using an Exchange\n","\n","A lot of individuals use the exchange Coinbase ever since they added the ability for customers to link their Paypal and Coinbase accounts. Depending on where you live you can purchase or sell Coinbase listed digital assets using the Paypal system. If you want to use Coinbase in order to utilize Paypal, then you must complete all of the identity verification procedures issued by the San Francisco firm. After your identity is confirmed with Coinbase, go to the “settings” section and then “linked accounts.”\n","\n","Simply click the “new account” tab and choose Paypal and the Coinbase dashboard will prompt you to log in to Paypal. After all these steps are complete, you can then purchase and sell digital assets with Paypal using the exchange. However, you can only link your Paypal account to one Coinbase account, the company’s guidelines note.\n","\n","Using a Peer-to-Peer Marketplace\n","\n","Another way to use Paypal in order to obtain cryptocurrencies is by using the peer-to-peer marketplace Local.Bitcoin.com. If you want to buy bitcoin cash (BCH) with Paypal you can register and log into your Local.Bitcoin.com account and press the “trades” tab. This will give you access to the “find an offer” and “create an offer” tabs.\n","\n","In the find an offer section, you can simply search for people selling BCH that accept Paypal for payments. Or, if you are planning to sell BCH, you can head over to the create an offer section and create one that accepts Paypal for payments. Looking at the worldwide listings on the BCH marketplace shows that there’s a great number of buyers and sellers who use Paypal. Other localized exchanges like Paxful, Localbitcoins, and Localcryptos (formally Localethereum) also let traders use Paypal.\n","\n","Weighing the Pros and Cons\n","\n","Other trading services that allow you to purchase digital currencies via Paypal include Etoro, Xcoins, Cancoin, Cryptonit, and Wirex. Every platform and exchange has pros and cons when it comes to buying cryptocurrencies with Paypal. For instance some services, like certain peer-to-peer marketplaces, offer better privacy and you don’t need identity verification to trade with Paypal.\n","\n","However, a bunch of the aforementioned companies do require account verification and KYC procedures like submitting a photo ID or proof-of-residence. Similar to Coinbase, in order to leverage Paypal with Wirex, you need to submit identification documents to deposit USD and be able to select the Paypal option. Most of the platforms that require identification will simply let you tether a Paypal account to the exchange as soon as you pass the verification services process.\n","\n","It’s likely that anonymity won’t be a big deal to people who want to use Paypal to purchase cryptos because the Paypal system itself is not really anonymous or private. If ID verification is an issue, people can always utilize trading platforms like Local.Bitcoin.com for more privacy. With more than 260 million active Paypal users today, there’s definitely a number of individuals who want to purchase or sell digital currencies like ethereum or bitcoin cash with the payment service.\n","\n","Have you ever purchased digital currencies with Paypal?

Likewise, a Coinbase spokesperson said Coinbase Commerce processed $135 million worth of cryptocurrency payments for thousands of merchants in 2019, which represents a 600 percent increase in the number of unique transactions via Coinbase Commerce since 2018.\n","\n","Ether and various stablecoins make up a small percentage of both of the above-mentioned totals, with Chainalysis reportedly estimating roughly $4 billion in bitcoin alone was sent through payment processors in 2019. As such, Coinbase is looking to build out its merchant services in 2020.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","Of course, the number for credit card payments is much higher, dwarfing bitcoin’s $4 billion purchasing power.

However, Lola Luna boutique owner Jean-Michel Daumas, a Coinbase Commerce customer who runs a luxury lingerie business in Paris, warned it’s still too soon to describe bitcoin payments as routine or trendy.\n","\n","“People are not ready to pay with crypto. They prefer to keep it rather than spend it,” Daumas said. “I prefer to receive payments in crypto because they are more secure for me. For example, when I receive payments from PayPal, some people cheat and say they didn’t receive the goods.”\n","\n","Daumas said his boutique received more than 90 bitcoin payments since early 2018, never more than four bitcoin payments a month. His customers are 80 percent men spending bitcoin on lingerie as a status symbol, an insight that aligns with BitPay’s findings that jewelry, precious metals and high-end tech products garner the most bitcoin buyers.\n","\n","“It’s a very high level of fabric, couture-level,” he said. “We sell much more during the Christmas holidays, for example, [which] has much more influence [on the store’s sales trends] than the price of bitcoin.”\n","\n","Indeed, Lola Luna is best known for statement pieces such as open G-string bottoms with dangling feathers to tickle sensitive areas. Perhaps some shoppers may choose to pay with bitcoin so that a “naked bra” and lace collar set doesn’t show up on a credit card bill. But, given French lingerie culture, Daumas said it’s “too early” to conclude why some shoppers prefer using bitcoin.\n","\n","For broader context, BitPay’s Zielke said Europe and the Middle East are generally home to the most high-value merchant transactions, while there are more North American shoppers in terms of unique transactions. In the meantime, Daumas prefers to simply transfer the bitcoin earnings to a hardware wallet and hodl.\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/line-link-japan-launch/\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/line-link-japan-launch/\n","[]\n","2020-02-03 10:34:00+00:00\n","Line's Digital Currency Link to Be Available in Japan as Early as April 2020\n","\n","Launched in October 2018, Asian messaging giant Line’s Bitbox crypto exchange has made its link (LN) digital asset available to users worldwide, with the exception of notable locations like Japan and the U.S. Last Thursday the group announced it was preparing to launch the coin in the Japanese market, compliant with the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). Though full details are not yet disclosed, a press release from Line details that the digital currency could be available to traders in Japan as soon as April 2020.\n","\n","Also Read: Popular Smartphone Apps Are Adding Crypto Capabilities\n","\n","Link to Arrive in Japanese Market\n","\n","Though the Line messaging app and payment service are popular in Japan, the Line corporation’s digital currency link (LN) has not yet been made available to the domestic market due to regulatory issues. In a press release posted Thursday Line announced:\n","\n","Since launching on the BITBOX cryptocurrency exchange on October 16, 2018, LINK has been available to users worldwide except in Japan and the United States. Concurrently, LVC [Line subsidiary] has been preparing to roll out the coins in the Japanese market in accordance with the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association’s (JVCEA) official process to handle new digital currency.\n","\n","The exact date of launch is not known but the release details, “The coin’s official release date (currently scheduled to be in as early as April 2020) will be announced separately once it is determined.”\n","\n","Line’s Bitbox exchange is at present unavailable to residents of Japan, but the press release notes that “LVC is currently developing a system in preparation for LINK’s debut in Japan.” It is unclear whether the Bitbox exchange itself will be regulated and made available to the Japanese market. However, Line’s in-app exchange service Bitmax, launched in September last year, is available in the country, and a separate announcement will be made when link is available on that platform, according to the release.\n","\n","Regulatory Hurdles for Multiple Social Apps\n","\n","Like link, other projects such as Telegram’s gram and Facebook’s libra currencies are no stranger to legal barriers. As electronic money and crypto redefine what currency is and innovate its potential use cases, regulators worldwide appear to be struggling to deal with the rapid progress.\n","\n","In October, Telegram chose to delay launch of its TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain in light of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing suit against the group, claiming the gram token is a security. The company had also refused to disclose financial information to the regulator, however this demand for disclosure was reportedly rejected by the New York Southern District Court in early January.\n","\n","Facebook’s libra sees its latest struggles in big time players exiting the Libra Association, some of whom are likely influenced by the project’s ongoing regulatory entanglements.\n","\n","Finally, popular Canadian messaging app Kik announced its own woes in September last year, pointing to an imminent shutdown in light of channeling resources to an SEC court battle for the sake of its own crypto known as “kin.” It’s in this broad milieu of turbulent relationships between new crypto projects and regulators that link will roll out in Japan. With the approval of the JVCEA, however, things can likely be expected to go more smoothly for Line’s digital asset.

Opinion on cryptoassets is polarised even if the ‘plumbing’, in the form of blockchain technology, is now widely accepted.\n","\n","Cryptocurrencies are booming globally and moving closer to the mainstream\n","\n","Investors face a large amount of hype and misinformation about crypto assets\n","\n","Cryptocurrencies may be useful as a diversifier in a portfolio\n","\n","When Bitcoin is the subject of fervent discussion among financial practitioners it is easy to draw the conclusion that in 2020 there will be continuing volatility in crypto-related assets. Yet the real problem for institutional investors is that, while there may be potential uses and attractions, they are hidden underneath an immense amount of misinformation and hype.\n","\n","“When institutions begin to consider cryptocurrency a legitimate asset class it will lead to a situation where individual savers have a proportion of their pensions held in a digital currency or invested in digital assets,” says David Mercer, the CEO of LMAX Exchange, a financial technology firm. “Even if it only starts out as a percentage point or two it will lead to extremely significant in-flows into the asset class.”\n","\n","The current size of the crypto-asset market, according to Aaro Capital, a company that facilitates investment in the technology, is about $200bn (€180bn) compared with $18bn at the beginning of 2017. In the past three years over 500 funds have been launched in the distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and crypto-assets sector.\n","\n","Bitcoin has made the initial investors millionaires or even billionaires, at least on paper. But if, as appears to be the case, most of the market capitalisation of Bitcoin is held by a tiny number of initial investors, most later investors face a serious risk of massive losses.\n","\n","The initial controlling investors need to sell their Bitcoin investments to monetise their value. Selling requires an ever-increasing number of willing buyers. For an asset that produces zero income, and whose increasing value is solely determined by increasing numbers of buyers, it smacks of a Ponzi scheme. Initial investors, whether the famed Winklevoss twins – who, it seems, may have owned 1% or so of Bitcoin at one stage – or others, would have to find willing buyers to monetise paper gains. Any large-scale selling by large investors is likely to trigger a selling panic.\n","\n","The one type of investor who will definitely generate profits from the crypto boom are those who have adopted the philosophy of the famed sellers of shovels during the California gold boom and provide services in the form of exchanges and the like for crypto-related transactions. But even here there can be confusion on the value that they can provide to institutional investors.\n","\n","There are two key questions facing institutional investors if they want to be involved in crypto assets. First, what are the requirements in terms of credit intermediation, regulation and infrastructure and cost.\n","\n","Second, and more importantly, what should be the role of crypto assets within a portfolio?\n","\n","LMAX’s Mercer argues that there needs to be an internationally trusted marketplace for institutional-only cryptocurrency trading. “We need banks with sizeable balance sheets to start acting as trusted central credit counterparties to provide traditional fund managers or hedge funds with the funds to implement their strategies and trades on the direction of cryptocurrencies.”\n","\n","But, as Max Boonen, CEO and founder of B2C2, one of the largest cryptocurrency liquidity providers, argues, the main premise of a crypto-currency is that there are no intermediaries in a transaction: “It is an ‘asset’ that cannot be taken away from you but the problem is that as a store of value it is extremely volatile.”\n","\n","For institutions, though, there is another key question: are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin assets akin to others within a pension fund portfolio? “If you think are currencies, they are not assets – pension funds don’t buy currencies to speculate, they buy assets that happen to be denominated in a specific currency,” Boonen says. “No-one in their right mind would want their pension funds invested in Bitcoin because currencies are not assets.”\n","\n","Pension funds are not in the business of trading currencies for speculative gains by betting on the direction of cryptocurrencies. It is therefore unclear what role a cryptocurrency offering zero yield would have within an institutional portfolio except as a source of diversification, alongside other volatile but zero-yielding commodities.\n","\n","Yet despite their volatility and uneven infrastructure, cryptocurrencies are moving ever closer to the mainstream. Ankush Jain, a partner at Aaro Capital, says this is happening in well-regulated countries such as the UK, where financial regulations have been reviewing them, Germany, where legislation has been proposed to enable banks to handle cryptocurrencies, and Switzerland, which has led the way in establishing crypto exchanges. High profile institutions such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are also taking the sector seriously.\n","\n","Crypto asset advocates such as Jain argue that their volatility presents opportunities in a world where return expectations across almost all established asset classes are depressed. Cryptocurrencies also have almost no correlation to other asset classes, and therefore provide clear diversification benefits. For institutional investment, Jain sees several possibilities:\n","\n","• Direct investments: these can be risky, however, especially when investing in larger amounts, given storage and execution risks.\n","\n","• Futures: available if one has the expertise to trade them\n","\n","• Passive funds: for example, through exchange-traded products. These offer capacity but are a blunt instrument. They have concentration risk (because of the dominance, for the time being, of Bitcoin)\n","\n","• Active hedge funds: Jain argues these are a better option because of the inefficiencies presented by the market: “Active, agile approaches can best exploit return opportunities and manage risk effectively. They are often small and difficult to source and diligence.”\n","\n","• Venture capital funds: these can offer purer forms of DLT exposure, but often have long lockups.\n","\n","• Multi-managers: these can offer a diversified portfolio of active managers that employ a range of different strategies.\n","\n","Different cryptocurrencies possess varying levels of monetary properties which, in turn, affect their relative usability as money. For investors, the challenge with investing in any crypto-currency is that the main argument that drives investment in Bitcoin is that the supply of Bitcoin is limited. That may be true, but the supply of cryptocurrencies as a whole is unlimited, with no substantial barriers to entry.\n","\n","Ido Sadeh Man, founder of Saga Monetary Technologies, points out that the cryptosphere is populated with cryptocurrency products – all geared towards delivering value through their approach to solving different issues – but their value is not being driven by demand for cryptocurrency per se, but by user demand for the solution they provide. “It’s correct to say that barriers to creation are low, he says. “But it’s what comes after creation that really sets them apart from each other, and exercises and demonstrates where their true value proposition lies.”\n","\n","Like any form of money, the value of a cryptocurrency is derived from a combination of the usefulness of its money-like properties and subsequent network effects. Unlike traditional currencies, larger cryptocurrencies are secured by their network value, points out Jain. The higher the value, the harder it is to attack the network. But that still leaves the issue that cryptocurrencies may have as much long-term stability as tulips in 17th century Netherlands as a store of value. For long-term institutional investors, that is still a deal breaker.\n","\n","One development that may change that is the creation of so-called ‘stable currencies’ which are linked to more stable baskets of currencies or commodities. Linkages to fiat currencies naturally mean that the cryptocurrencies are no longer decentralised as there are implicit links to the monetary policies of the issuing countries in the currency basket.\n","\n","Facebook with its Libra electronic currency is leading a new trend – that of corporations issuing their own units of exchange linked to baskets of assets. Whether that will take off remains to be seen. But for central banks and institutional investors it adds further complexity to an already difficult set of challenges.\n","https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptojackers-kobe-bryant-image-mine-cryptocurrency-cssf-reginald-fowler-twitter-bitcoin-emoji\n","https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptojackers-kobe-bryant-image-mine-cryptocurrency-cssf-reginald-fowler-twitter-bitcoin-emoji\n","['Matthew Beedham', 'Story By']\n","2020-02-03 09:24:09+00:00\n","Matthew is the editor of SHIFT.

A change in the bitcoin scripting language, they add, will enable the protocol to perform functions – like smart contracts – and potentially allow the project to compete with blockchain projects such as ethereum.\n","\n","Genesis is designed to be the last significant update on the BSV blockchain; the implementation has been “locked-in irrevocably,” according to an on-chain message in the first post-fork transaction from the BSV developer team. An unchanging base protocol saves developers and companies from having to undergo frequent technical changes, the team says.\n","\n","'Inadvertent' split\n","\n","BitMEX Research tweeted there were still “a significant number of nodes [that] have not upgraded for the hardfork and are stuck on the pre-hardfork block,” an hour or so after the Genesis implementation.\n","\n","Initially there appeared to be no signs of a chain split – where a blockchain splinters into multiple active versions – but BitMEX research reported just a few hours later the pre-Genesis chain had been “extended by one block.”\n","\n","A BSV spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk the split had been caused by one miner – “which in the scheme of things is very good” – the Bitcoin Association was trying to contact.\n","\n","Nguyen said this was not a “persistent chain split” but what appeared to be a miner “who did not update their software to Genesis.” None of the mining pools so far contacted by the association had been responsible for the “inadvertent block,” he added.\n","\n","“A single block inadvertently mined on the wrong chain will not be extended – just the way Nakamoto consensus is supposed to work as described in the Bitcoin white paper. Nodes consider the longest chain as valid and extend that branch,” Nguyen said.\n","\n","BSV has been at the center of controversy since it forked from bitcoin cash in November 2018. One of its main proponents, Craig Wright, has claimed to be bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto since 2016; many industry figures have disagreed with his claims, however.\n","\n","Further, the cryptocurrency’s proponents commonly hold the belief that BSV is the true bitcoin.\n","\n","“Bitcoin can finally be Bitcoin again and the miners can continue to write the Chronicle of everything,” stated the on-chain post-fork message.\n","\n","Emotions still run high on this issue. For instance, after announcing Monday that Twitter added a bitcoin emoji to its platform, billionaire and BSV advocate Calvin Ayre tweeted founder Jack Dorsey he is backing the “wrong side.”\n","https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/81355/mode-unveils-bitcoin-buying-app\n","https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/81355/mode-unveils-bitcoin-buying-app\n","[]\n","2020-02-04 10:41:00\n","Source: Mode\n","\n","London-based fintech firm Mode, advised and backed by Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, has launched its Bitcoin banking mobile iOS app.\n","\n","This will make Bitcoin - the world’s most popular digital asset which many refer to as ‘digital gold’ - accessible to everyone at the touch of a button.\n","\n","\n","\n","The platform is available to users globally, except in the United States of America.\n","\n","\n","\n","A Mode account can be opened in less than 60 seconds, with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements completed in less than two minutes through AI-enabled identity verification technology. Once users are whitelisted, depositing GBP via bank transfer and buying Bitcoin takes seconds.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mode’s launch is supported by new research (1) which reveals that many current and potential Bitcoin investors are unhappy with the platforms and services currently on offer. Findings (2) also reveal the potential for strong Bitcoin market growth, as 42% of people who currently own Bitcoin plan to buy more, 51% of people surveyed indicated they may buy Bitcoin soon, and just a small fraction of respondents, around 7%, said they have no intention of currently buying the digital asset.\n","\n","\n","\n","Through its new easy to use app, Mode aims to bring down the barriers and open up the Bitcoin market to everyone, not just tech-savvy or professional investors. As a result, users can get started with only £50, and unlike many other apps, Mode only charge a very competitive fee of 0.99% at the time of purchasing and selling Bitcoin. Mode doesn’t charge for transferring GBP in and out of users’ accounts, and funds are credit almost instantly via Faster Payments - a process that can take up to 5 days with some of the most renown crypto exchanges.\n","\n","\n","\n","Users can buy Bitcoin with bank cards or via a bank transfer, which is then safeguarded through one of the world’s leading digital asset custodians, BitGo.\n","\n","\n","\n","In addition to its new app, Mode has also announced plans to launch a Bitcoin interest-generating product later this year, which would allow users to earn passive income on their Bitcoin holdings without having to touch their assets.\n","\n","\n","\n","Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter, joined Mode as an advisor of the project. He has also invested in Mode and acts as a non-executive director of R8, Mode’s parent company.\n","\n","\n","\n","“Although there are multiple existing ways to access the Bitcoin market right now, few appeal to the everyday person, who wants to buy and hold some Bitcoin. Most of the current apps all have one problem at their core—access.” Biz Stone commented; “Mode has removed needlessly complex processes from their app, building a beautiful and responsive UI and UX rivalling that of the major challenger banks—while also launching a completely new and innovative Bitcoin product.”\n","\n","\n","\n","Ariane Murphy, Head of Communications and Marketing, Mode, said: “Our new app not only enables us to capture the huge growth in the Bitcoin marketplace, but also tackles many of the issues people have with the current platforms and storage services available, which our research shows are significant. The Mode app addresses transaction restrictions issues, low speed/high cost, lack of security and most importantly, tackles the poor user experience typically associated with Bitcoin apps.”\n","\n","\n","\n","“Until the beginning of this year, we pilot-tested our app with some 1,000 early subscribers and their feedback has been very positive. This, coupled with the strong growth in the marketplace, means we are confident that now is the right time to launch to the wider public.”\n","\n","\n","\n","Challenges to tackle in the digital asset markets - new research\n","\n","Mode recently conducted research (1) with people who already own digital assets, revealing that 41% of respondents described the process of transacting Bitcoin through existing solutions as average or poor, with just 13% describing the process as excellent.\n","\n","\n","\n","Some 37% say the level of security offered by the platforms they have used is again average or poor, with 41% claiming security is good and 21% excellent - signifying some room for improvement.\n","\n","\n","\n","In terms of overall user experience, just 56% describe other digital asset services as good or excellent, with 32% saying it is average and 11% describing their experience as poor.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mode is part of R8 Group, a UK fintech group which raised $5m in a heavily oversubscribed funding round in April 2019, backed by an experienced management team with extensive experience in the financial services and technology sectors.

Among the new updates included in the mobile app focused on speed is Instant Pay, a feature which completes bitcoin cash payments in less than a second, making it faster than traditional payment methods and other existing wallets. It delivers a seamless payment experience through the app, allowing users to complete transactions instantly at online and physical retailers that accept bitcoin cash.\n","\n","To use this new feature, you simply need to set up a spending threshold in the app before performing a transaction and then the BCH payment can be completed instantly once the recipient’s QR code has been scanned. The increased speed should result in more customers choosing BCH as their preferred choice of payment.\n","\n","“Censorship-resistant peer-to-peer cash is now lightning fast through our wallet app. Instant Pay, an all-new wallet feature which is exclusive to Bitcoin Cash, lets you make payments in a split second,” stated Stefan Rust, CEO of Bitcoin.com. “These payments outpace Visa and Mastercard, making our wallet app faster than any other.”\n","\n","In addition to speed, the new wallet app feature other new and improved functions including letting users manage BCH and BTC in one secure integrated platform, as well as allowing them to purchase BCH and BTC using a credit card. The app also focuses on personal customization, letting users tweak their accounts to their liking with new options. The developers have even introduced a personal notes mechanism, which allows users to append data to individual transactions.\n","\n","On the privacy and security side, fingerprint identification and facial recognition are also now available to ensure that only the owner can access the account. And customizable transaction speed settings have been introduced, which can be used to delay payment confirmation. The app also features a Discover section – a new maps interface that allows users to locate nearby merchants that accept bitcoin cash for payments, ensuring you can always find a place to spend BCH and encouraging more businesses to adopt the cryptocurrency.\n","\n","“The new design of the Bitcoin.com Wallet makes the entire experience easier for new users,” commented Corbin Fraser, the Head of Product at Bitcoin.com. “Our design team spent a lot of time considering how to create the most beautiful Bitcoin wallet available on the market today.”\n","\n","Your Key to the SLP Token Ecosystem\n","\n","Our development team has also been working around the clock to bring a completely re-imagined app experience that includes SLP tokens, so that the Bitcoin Cash powered tokens are now available in every wallet. With built-in token management support, users can send, receive, and store a variety of tokens that represent anything from dollar-pegged stablecoins to virtual gaming assets and company loyalty points, with the private keys held only by the user.\n","\n","“With the addition of SLP token support, the Bitcoin.com Wallet app has become more than a place to store bitcoin,” added Fraser. “You can now manage thousands of diverse digital assets on the app alongside your cryptocurrency. Stay tuned for more game-changing features which are coming soon, too.”\n","\n","Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) is an easy to use, robust and extensible token management system that allows anyone to create tokens on the Bitcoin Cash network in a permissionless way. It has helped the development of an ecosystem for BCH that replicates the variety of ERC20 tokens on the ETH network. SLP tokens can easily be created, traded, and managed on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain within seconds, while costing users only fractions of a penny for each transaction. All transactions are recorded onchain, and custom token behavior can be defined using a bitcoin Script developing language.\n","\n","SLP token adoption has grown rapidly since being introduced in August 2018. This is in part thanks to Bitcoin.com Exchange which has started listing SLP tokens for trading on its platform. These include assets such as Gocrypto’s GOC, a token that enables merchants to accept crypto payments and receive settlement in their local fiat currency, as well as ACD, a token issued by the Tokyo-based ANA Holdings subsidiary Alliance Cargo Direct. Another recently released SLP token is Lead, an exclusive reward token you can earn by growing the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. SLP support has also been added by Cybavo, a cybersecurity firm providing private key management services to some of the biggest exchanges in the world. In total more than 6,000 tokens have been created using the SLP framework so far.\n","\n","Last month, Bitcoin.com released the open source SLP Indexer Server for validating tokens and to make SLP transactions perform as fast as BCH, empowering developers to create even greater projects on the Bitcoin Cash network.\n","\n","The Bitcoin.com Wallet app is free to download now for Android and iOS.\n","\n","What do you think about the lightning fast new Bitcoin.com Wallet?

About $5 million of XRP and ADA was stolen. The hack was successful because the hacker gained access to users’ login credentials. What can be done to secure your account in the unlikely event that hackers get your login info?\n","\n","Using Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication would be an option.\n","\n","Google Authenticator is a helpful way of adding a level of security to your crypto exchange accounts. Google has a strong reputation for offering secure interactions with its suite of products, and the authenticator has become a staple of the security measures the internet giant offers customers.\n","\n","Why You Should Set Up Google Authenticator to Secure Your Crypto Exchange Accounts\n","\n","If you’re wondering how to use Google Authenticator, you may have some idea as to its value. Examining what it does to the process of a potential hacker may reveal even more benefits.\n","\n","Many digital asset exchanges only have one level of security, the username and password. If a hacker has somehow gotten ahold of your login credentials for a crypto exchange account (via a phishing email for example), all they have to do is go to the exchange’s website, enter your details, and steal your coins.\n","\n","Now, let’s see how Google Authenticator makes it so much harder for a hacker – even one with full access to usernames and passwords – to successfully access your account.\n","\n","When you try to login, Google Authenticator essentially says, “That’s nice you know your username and password. Now, please prove that it’s really you.” This is done using one of your personal devices. The Google Authenticator app is installed on one or more of them, and a code is sent to the device via the app. Let’s say you have the app installed on your phone. When a hacker, armed with your crypto account login info, tries to get into your account, they are prompted to enter a code that is sent to your phone. They would have to have your phone, as well as the passcode to open it, in order to access your account.\n","\n","Even if someone were to jack your SIM card and gain access to all of its data, you’re still protected with Google Authenticator because this two-factor authentication method doesn’t allow codes to be stored on your SIM card.\n","\n","How to Set Up Google Authenticator\n","\n","Download Google Authenticator on one or more devices. Using more than one device means you have a backup in case one of them is lost or stolen. You can find the app here for iPhone and here for Android devices. If you haven’t already, secure your device with a password. Create a Gmail account with another device. You need a gmail account to use Google Authenticator. If you already have one, you can use it. Log into your Google account and enable two-step authentication. You can go to https://www.google.com/landing/2step/. This will give you a QR code. You will use this to add devices. It would be a good idea to take a screenshot of the QR code and store it securely because then you can use it to add more devices later. You will also get backup codes that can be used to recover your account if the need arises. These should be stored as well. Scan the QR code with your devices that you will use with Google Authenticator. This produces an authentication code on each device. It’s a combination of six numbers, and it changes every 15 seconds. This is called your “token,” and you will use it to login to your crypto exchange account from now on. When figuring out how to use Google Authenticator, this is the most crucial step: the generation of the token. Entering these six numbers confirms that it’s really you. Enable two-factor authentication for every crypto exchange account for which you want to use it. The steps will be more or less the same for each account. You enable two-factor authentication, scan the QR code with your devices, put in the token and then log in to make sure everything’s working.\n","\n","If you are an active trader with a substantial digital asset holding in your trading account(s), it is strongly advisable to use Google Authenticator as an additional security layer for your online accounts.\n","\n","Related Reading:\n","\n","If you want to learn more blockchain and digital asset investing, subscribe to Bitcoin Market Journal today!\n","https://www.coindesk.com/inside-the-standards-race-for-implementing-fatfs-travel-rule\n","https://www.coindesk.com/inside-the-standards-race-for-implementing-fatfs-travel-rule\n","[]\n","2020-02-04 16:10:25+00:00\n","The Takeaway:\n","\n","Crypto businesses are figuring out how to comply with the Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule,” where all crypto transactions above a certain amount must be accompanied by identifying information.\n","\n","Competing visions for the technical implementation have emerged, though there appears to be general agreement on the need for messaging standards.\n","\n","Legal and operational issues will be as challenging as putting technical solutions in place.\n","\n","The FATF is set to kick the tires of a range of proposed tech solutions in June 2020.\n","\n","Imagine SWIFT’s interbank messaging system but for crypto.\n","\n","Hardcore blockchain libertarians would probably rather not. But firms that deal in cryptocurrency have been asked to abide by the so-called “Travel Rule,” and the clock is ticking.\n","\n","Although it goes against the grain to shoehorn an identity layer onto a technology specifically designed to be pseudonymous, firms have no choice if they want to abide by the law. The shape and form this will take is something the industry must agree on, and fast.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog, updated its guidance to explicitly state that virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, must share sender (originator) and receiver (beneficiary) information in cryptocurrency transactions above a certain threshold.\n","\n","With the one-year mark fast approaching, the FATF will review progress on Travel Rule solutions at its June 2020 plenary meeting.\n","\n","Meanwhile, U.S. regulator FinCEN issued its version of the regulation pertaining to VASPs in May 2019, stating that firms had 180 days to get their houses in order. This means the Travel Rule now carries the weight of law regarding U.S.-based VASPs. (VASPs are businesses that conduct the exchange, transfer or safekeeping of virtual assets, as well as activities relating to issuing or underwriting virtual assets.)\n","\n","There are differences of opinion over the best technical solution, with some favoring a blockchain-based approach and others not. Equally challenging are the operational and legal hurdles crypto exchanges face in rolling out a compliant system en masse.\n","\n","To DLT or not to DLT?\n","\n","There are two parts to the problem. First, there needs to be some means of identifying VASPs. This could be broadly equivalent to the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) used by SWIFT or something like the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) system.\n","\n","The second part of the problem concerns data transmission. The ideal solution crypto businesses and industry groups are working towards would be a standards-based and interoperable message layer between VASPs, allowing identity, authentication and messaging to be pinned onto blockchain transactions.\n","\n","There are some 20-plus solutions being built to tackle the problem. Some are relatively small-scale commercial endeavors, while others involve groups of participating firms and behave more like open protocols.\n","\n","Some of the offerings mentioned in the working group arena include Bitcoin Suisse’s OpenVASP, CipherTrace’s TRISA, Sygna Bridge, Netki, Shyft and KYC Chain. Dedicated crypto-sleuthing firms including Elliptic, Coinfirm and Chainalysis have all been working on this as well. Indeed, Chainalysis recently hired former FinCEN staffer Mike Mosier to help build Travel Rule capabilities.\n","\n","There are proposals that favor a more traditional battle-tested approach – such as having a centralized global registry of VASP addresses as a necessary trust anchor – and then there are the solutions taking a more decentralized approach, involving blockchains or DLT.\n","\n","“The assumption that blockchain must have the solution to something that is a blockchain problem may not necessarily be true – as desirable as that may be for folks at an aspirational level, philosophically,” said Siân Jones, senior partner at XReg Consulting and convener of the Joint Working Group for InterVASP Messaging Standards (JWG-IVMS).\n","\n","Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at trade group Global Digital Finance said his view (and the view of some regulators) is there needs to be more than one tech provider.\n","\n","“So it might be that Coinbase chooses Tech Provider A; Binance uses Provider B,” he said. “So we end up with a matrix, with smaller exchanges copying the larger ones they want to work with.”\n","\n","Turning to ethereum\n","\n","Switzerland’s OpenVASP project is what you might expect from a country that’s relatively advanced when it comes to meeting FATF recommendations, and has even gone beyond them in some respects.\n","\n","The project is helmed by Bitcoin Suisse and also includes Lykke exchange and crypto banks Seba and Sygnum. The Swiss have taken a practical approach, building a solution the industry can start using as quickly as possible.\n","\n","A key design principle for OpenVASP is decentralization, which means avoiding the mistakes of the past, say its developers, like having a single point of failure, central servers and directories. In order to achieve decentralization where it’s deemed desirable, OpenVASP is leveraging a selection of features from ethereum.\n","\n","For instance, at its messaging layer, OpenVASP proposes using Whisper, ethereum’s off-chain peer-to-peer messaging system. (To be clear, the OpenVASP white paper points out other messaging systems can be used.)\n","\n","Whisper employs so-called dark routing to obscure message content and sender and receiver details to observers, a bit like anonymous web browsing using Tor, making it a neat way to meet privacy requirements.\n","\n","“This means that nobody would be able to understand that two VASPs are interacting with each other,” said David Riegelnig, head of risk management at Bitcoin Suisse. “With respect to competitiveness, it should be nobody’s business to know which VASPs interact, as long as the VASPs comply with their Travel Rule requirements and can do their sanctions checks screening and so forth.”\n","\n","Who’s in charge?\n","\n","The addressing and authentication parts of the OpenVASP solution use ethereum’s decentralized public key infrastructure, meaning the VASP must deploy a smart contract that represents identity on the blockchain. Using smart contracts on ethereum creates a blockchain public key directory for the VASP and an IBAN-like numbering format: the virtual asset account number (VAAN).\n","\n","“The alternative could be a global directory of VASPs with their public keys, which sounds very simple,” said Riegelnig. “But then you have to ask, ‘In which country is this server going to stand? In which jurisdiction? Who controls it?’ And so on.”\n","\n","Obviously there are going to be people who are concerned that OpenVASP is tied to ethereum, Riegelnig said. “They think it’s everything on the blockchain. But the only thing we actually use on ethereum is the smart contract where you store the public key,” he said. “Then these concerns tend to get much smaller.”\n","\n","OpenVASP said it is in talks with all the big exchanges and named Binance, Kraken and Bitstamp as three that are looking at its solution. Having read the other white papers, Riegelnig said that, with the possible exception of very centralized commercial projects, they all involve some intangible parts that are basically high-level ideas.\n","\n","Riegelnig said OpenVASP was “on the same page” as CipherTrace when it comes to exchanging end-to-end encrypted messages and not having a persistent blockchain data layer. But elsewhere there are shortcomings, he said.\n","\n","“They [CipherTrace] somehow still rely on blockchain addresses as the identifier between VASPs. That is not very practical because public blockchain addresses change all the time,” said Riegelnig. “When you have a client and you want to transfer crypto to other VASPs, it’s much easier if you can refer to this client or their account by a client number, instead of an ever-changing blockchain address number.”\n","\n","Disagreements\n","\n","CipherTrace’s TRISA uses public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authorities. A “know-your-VASP” certificate would be sent from the exchange originating a transaction to the one receiving it. These certificates would be verified through a trusted third-party certificate authority.\n","\n","CipherTrace Chief Financial Analyst John Jefferies pointed out that while a certificate authority might be controlled by a central entity, there are typically multiple distributed instances and therefore does not constitute a single point of failure.\n","\n","“By avoiding global directories, OpenVASP is also avoiding known good security, and betting the whole thing on the ethereum blockchain,” said Jefferies.\n","\n","“The thing about public key is that there are a lot of service providers and there can be numerous competing service providers. So while it’s not like the one grand VASP PKI in the sky, if one comes and another goes then people can change and they can adopt those certificates,” he said.\n","\n","As far as interoperability is concerned, ethereum keys on OpenVASP can be supported by PKI, said Jefferies: PKI is extensible so the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. This speaks to a wider issue.\n","\n","“Switzerland has some strict rules, but they don’t have a lot of interoperability with the U.S., and so I think the interoperability in this case is an important component,” Jefferies said.\n","\n","‘SWIFT for crypto’\n","\n","While firms duke it out for the best technical solution, agreeing on a standard format to handle the message payloads will simplify things, at least on one level.\n","\n","“The timeline could be dramatically reduced and the costs minimized if there was an open standard, like ISO or IEEE standards,” said Jones of the InterVASP group. This would be a common universal language for the transfer of data, regardless of any national legislation, and regardless of which technological solution the VASP plugs into, she said.\n","\n","The InterVASP group has been joined by a coalition of trade bodies including Global Digital Finance, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and the International Digital Asset Exchange Association (IDAXA). The goal of the InterVASP group is to have a standard in place and ready for adoption by May 8, during New York Blockchain Week.\n","\n","Standardizing the underlying messaging packet is a good path to follow, said Wright of Global Digital Finance. In situations like this, something as simple as date of birth, for example, might cause problems, Wright said. DOBs could be in U.K. format, U.S. format or long-form actual format.\n","\n","“If every provider chose its own format, the cost of actually deciphering it on receipt and then making sure you have accurately transposed it is quite significant,” he said. “So having even the simplest of things like that in a format that makes sense goes a long way to standardize the industry.”\n","\n","Wright acknowledged the stigma around the idea of a “SWIFT for crypto,” which instantly raises hackles. “If you’ve got the same order of fields and the same name of fields, and you know how to deal with transliteration and so forth, all agreed by the industry, then that part of SWIFT, in essence, is a reasonable thing,” he said.\n","\n","Call the lawyers\n","\n","Exchanging personal data between VASPs in different parts of the world could require detailed legal frameworks in order to not run afoul of regulations like GDPR, said Coinfirm CEO Pawel Kuskowski.\n","\n","For this reason, Coinfirm, which has also formed a working group and claims to have government backing for that endeavor, has pulled in Gibraltar-based crypto lawyer Joey Garcia, partner at ISOLAS LLP, and London-based Dean Armstrong QC, head of chambers at the 36 Group.\n","\n","Coinfirm is using a high-throughput permissioned blockchain for writing the “fingerprint” of a compliant transaction, built on the enterprise-grade DLT Hyperledger Fabric. The latter employs a private channel architecture, which has been compared to private message channels on Slack.\n","\n","“There are two parts to consider when you are talking about the Travel Rule,” Kuskowski said. “One is part is technological and the other is regulatory. Really anyone who is touching this has to have someone from the legal space.”\n","\n","Jefferies of CipherTrace said solving the technical challenge is not any greater than the operational hurdle, or “sunrise problem” of switching on the system for 500 VASPs at once.\n","\n","As G20 countries gradually begin to roll this out, increased jurisdictional arbitrage seems likely, he added.\n","https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-price-stable-bitmex-swap/\n","https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-price-stable-bitmex-swap/\n","['Bhushan Akolkar', 'Benjamin Godfrey', 'Kofi Ansah']\n","2020-02-04 14:01:03+00:00\n","Despite markets are going down, XRP price remains stable.

The traders have to pay some funding fees for the opening of such a swap contract. The contract is exchanging currency swaps among short and long users, this ensures convergence between the true price and perpetual one.\n","\n","When the perpetual price becomes greater than the market price, a fee goes from shorts to longs. When the perpetual price goes down, the longs are paying the shorts.

Remittances are carried out on such accounts, and only the opening and closing of the account is listed on the blockchain.\n","\n","This results in a mode of payment that is allegedly much faster and scalable as compared to that made on the blockchain.\n","\n","The MIT Spider is attributed as an efficient one because members can invest as little as a section of funds in their account. MIT spider can also process four times more transactions as compared to other payment checking networks.\n","\n","The report also mentioned that the scheme functions by dividing transactions in small packets that spread across different channels, dividing helps to route big payments through accounts with low funding levels. Due to this method, congestion is avoided according to its developing team. Vibhaalakshmi mentioned that the MIT Spider was inspired by packet switching, which is an effective way of carrying data over the web.”\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&as_drrb=b&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/04/2020,cd_max:02/04/2020,sbd:1&tbm=nws&ei=atqhYJDBHojRtAbIu7zoCg&start=10&sa=N&ved=0ahUKEwiQno742s_wAhWIKM0KHcgdD60Q8tMDCIQB\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&as_drrb=b&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/04/2020,cd_max:02/04/2020,sbd:1&tbm=nws&ei=atqhYJDBHojRtAbIu7zoCg&start=20&sa=N&ved=0ahUKEwiQno742s_wAhWIKM0KHcgdD60Q8tMDCIYB\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&as_drrb=b&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/04/2020,cd_max:02/04/2020,sbd:1&tbm=nws&ei=atqhYJDBHojRtAbIu7zoCg&start=10&sa=N&ved=0ahUKEwiQno742s_wAhWIKM0KHcgdD60Q8NMDCIgB\n","https://support.google.com/websearch/?p=ws_results_help&hl=en&fg=1\n","https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/hownewsworks/?fg=1\n","#\n","https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&fg=1\n","https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en&fg=1\n","02/05/2020\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&tbm=nws&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/05/2020,cd_max:02/05/2020,sbd:1&sa=X&hl=en&gl=us&as_drrb=b&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&gbv=1&sei=dNqhYKO2JIa8tAaZwqawAQ\n","None\n","https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/181196?hl=en\n","None\n","https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijwPb82s_wAhUGHs0KHRmhCRYQPAgI\n","#\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijwPb82s_wAhUGHs0KHRmhCRYQ_AUIDigA\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/05/2020,cd_max:02/05/2020,sbd:1&tbm=bks&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijwPb82s_wAhUGHs0KHRmhCRYQ_AUIECgC\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/05/2020,cd_max:02/05/2020&tbm=vid&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijwPb82s_wAhUGHs0KHRmhCRYQ_AUIESgD\n","/search?q=bitcoin+cryptocurrency&hl=en&gl=us&tbas=0&biw=1685&bih=863&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:02/05/2020,cd_max:02/05/2020&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijwPb82s_wAhUGHs0KHRmhCRYQ_AUIEigE\n","/preferences\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/market-update-bitcoin-cash-shines/\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/market-update-bitcoin-cash-shines/\n","[]\n","2020-02-05 16:06:33+00:00\n","Market Update: Bitcoin Cash Up 153% Since Jan. 1, Perma Bull Tom Lee Predicts New BTC Highs\n","\n","Digital currency markets are in the green again today after seeing some moderate losses the day prior.

Caruso is the founder of Zima Digital Assets, a blockchain and cryptocurrency investment firm, and has dubbed himself the “Michael Jordan of algorithmic cryptocurrency trading.” Authorities arrested Zachary Salter, an aspiring R&B singer who co-founded Zima with Caruso, the same day.\n","\n","Investigators said that “numerous victims” caught in the elaborate scam were former Major League Baseball players and their families. The players themselves are not identified in court documents. Other victims are described as senior citizens, such as the 76-year-old who gave the two men $200,000 to invest in cryptocurrency and an 86-year-old who entrusted them with $60,000.\n","\n","The government believes the $7.5 million is just a portion of their total haul, and that the pair may have stashed additional ill-gotten proceeds “in an unknown location.”\n","\n","Authorities say that Caruso, who declared income of just $22,800 in 2018, was able to convince the public that Zima was skillfully playing the crypto market and generating big returns.\n","\n","“I’m not in the business of guessing, I make calculated trades using tested principles and algorithms since trading is using historical models to predict the future,” Caruso said last year.\n","\n","Zima’s website says the firm “operates various private funds focusing on investments in cutting-edge technologies, including crypto and other blockchain based assets.” It also claims that Caruso and Salter have been “investing in long and short cryptocurrency and blockchain technology strategies since 2012.”\n","\n","None of that is true, contend prosecutors.\n","\n","The “pattern of investor payments against investor payouts with no investment of funds is consistent with…a Ponzi scheme,” court filings say. There is “no evidence any of the investment funds…have gone to any cryptocurrency/digital asset investment, or to any investment of any kind.”\n","\n","The investigation began after the Federal Trade Commission received an anonymous complaint about Zima in April 2019.\n","\n","Most of the money Caruso and Salter took from their customers went not into investments but toward funding their opulent lifestyles, prosecutors say. They each lived in mansions valued at about $9 million. Caruso is the registered owner of a 2019 Lamborghini Urus, and over the last two years spent at least $350,000 to rent, among other luxury vehicles, a Rolls Royce, a Ferrari, and an Aston Martin. Caruso, who also flew to London, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Hawaii, Cabo San Lucas and Aruba aboard private jets over the past two years, and has taken about 30 trips to Las Vegas, where he lost more than $1.4 million gambling in a 13-month period.\n","\n","Salter, meanwhile, describes himself as “a serial entrepreneur” who has interests in the aviation and automotive industries.\n","\n","“I’ve known since I was young that I wanted to make a positive impact,” he said in a Q&A with Entrepreneur magazine last June. “My mantra is ‘Gold Intentions,’ which I got as a tattoo when I dropped out of college at 20 years old.”\n","\n","Salter, who reported no income at all in 2018, lived just as lavishly as Caruso. He owns two Mercedes, a BMW, an Audi, and a 1957 Chevy, which he flaunted online. Court documents point to Instagram posts as evidence of their lifestyle.\n","\n","“Some other relevant Instagram photos include a posting dated August 1, 2018, in which a woman posted a photograph with her posing next to a newer model white BMW sedan with a red gift bow on it thanking her boyfriend, Salter, for surprising her with a new car,” the complaint says. “On May 12, 2019, Salter posted on Instagram that he purchased a new car for his mother on Mother’s Day with a photo of her standing near a newer model Mercedes. Also posted on Instagram was a video in which Salter is laughing with Caruso about Caruso damaging ‘another one’ of his Ferraris with the video focused on the scraped rear bumper of a Ferrari.”\n","\n","Authorities had Caruso and Salter under both physical and electronic surveillance.\n","\n","Caruso has spent time in jail before. He was found guilty of threatening to cut off a man’s hands and genitals in a $200,000 extortion scheme he carried out with his father in 2009. Caruso received five years probation for that crime, but was sentenced to three years in prison for violating the terms of his probation on three separate occasions. He was released in 2017, after serving 20 months, and set up the Zima website shortly after getting out.\n","\n","Authorities wrote in the court documents that Caruso “appears to have wholeheartedly embraced his background and chartered the career trajectory of a full-time, career criminal…He appears to believe that he is endowed with superior intelligence, and indeed, details of his activities in jail where he engaged in a complex coordination of people and resources provided glimpses of a criminal mastermind at work.”\n","\n","Prosecutors argued that Caruso be detained pending trial, calling him a flight risk. He “has spent his entire adult life attempting to defraud people,” the government said in a motion filed with the court. “He has already utilized at least half a dozen criminal schemes. His relationship with the truth is tenuous at best.”\n","\n","Salter, who does not have a prior criminal history, was released to his father’s custody.

Notice altcoins strength.\n","\n","It could be positive for cryptocurrencies because altcoins rose more than BTCUSD during the last bull market of 2016 and 2017. It’s similar to breadth in the stock market, when investors widen their buying into smaller companies as prices advance.\n","\n","No single news event seems to explain the strength in altcoins, although attention seems to be returning to cryptos. Earlier this week, for instance, CNBC reported that BTCUSD had its best January in seven years.\n","\n","Here Comes Halving\n","\n","Google Trends also shows interest in the term “halving” has doubled since late November.

The CEO of the company explained that its internal restructuring has not worked out but insisted that the ongoing protests in Hong Kong and coronavirus outbreak have not affected his platform much.\n","\n","Also read: 41 German Banks Now Charge Negative Interest Rates\n","\n","Bitspark Closing Shop After 5 Years\n","\n","Hong Kong-based crypto exchange and remittance service provider Bitspark announced on Tuesday that it is shutting down on March 4. CEO George Harrap explained:\n","\n","This decision was not taken lightly, particularly due to the excellent performance we have seen since the release of our Cash Point product late last year which has seen 400% MoM growth.\n","\n","There will be limited services between now and the end of March 4. The CEO added that customers can contact the company directly and request a withdrawal “if their Bitspark account or DEX wallet (with sparkdex assets) still has a balance.” He clarified, “Liquidity will remain on the Bitspark markets until 4 March and the final ZEPH buyback will be an order on the order books as of today.” After March 4, account logins will be disabled for a period of 90 days.\n","\n","Company Says Business Was Going Well\n","\n","Prior to this shutdown announcement, Bitspark had been working on launching several projects. On Dec. 27, the company highlighted in a year-in-review post that it had 144 trading pairs in 12 currencies and had issued stablecoins in HKD and PHP. In addition, it claimed to have had a steady stream of inbound customers from over 30 countries. “Next year, as we integrate with ERC20, Bitspark will be the primary provider of cash-to-crypto services for everything related to the Ethereum network, including hard wallets like Trezor and the global DeFi movement,” Bitspark wrote.\n","\n","Harrap noted that his company was “the first company to ever do end to end remittances via bitcoin in 2014,” adding that it was also “the first exchange in Asia with 20+ tokens (2014), the first [with] stablecoins for exotic currencies, first exchange in Asia with insurance coverage (Bitgo) and the only cash-based fiat on/off ramp in crypto.”\n","\n","Founded in Hong Kong in 2014, the company operates a web-based platform for sending and receiving payments using cryptocurrency. “We were the first in the world to send a cash-in, cash-out bitcoin transfer between Hong Kong and the Philippines – it was the first use case the industry saw of crypto being used for utility above all else,” its website details.\n","\n","Coronavirus and Protests Not to Blame\n","\n","In his Tuesday announcement, the CEO divulged the reason for shutting down. He wrote, “Unfortunately due to internal restructuring that hasn’t worked out, and a decision taken by shareholders internally, we have made the decision to close our doors.” He elaborated:\n","\n","While the HK protests and now virus epidemic haven’t affected us much, it hasn’t helped either.\n","\n","Businesses in Hong Kong have been suffering from a number of factors, weighing down on the region’s economy. Not only are there ongoing protests, but there is now also the coronavirus scare that has driven many investors out of the area. The number of coronavirus cases has grown to 24,536 worldwide, with 492 deaths reported as of Wednesday.\n","\n","Last week, the South China Morning Post reported that banks in Hong Kong are closing up to 30% of branches as a public safety measure. For example, Bank of China will close 49 branches, Bank of East Asia 20, HSBC 20 premier and four business centers, and Hang Seng 18 branches and 10 MTR outlets. Flights to Hong Kong are also being suspended. American Airlines and United Airlines, for example, announced on Tuesday that they are suspending flights from the U.S. to Hong Kong until Feb. 20 due to a drop in demand as the coronavirus spreads.\n","\n","Do you think Hong Kong crypto businesses are much affected by the coronavirus outbreak and ongoing protests?

the daily and weekly charts are signaling strong bullish momentum.\n","\n","Bitcoin could test the psychological resistance of $10,000 in the near term. Pullbacks, if any, could be short-lived.\n","\n","While bitcoin’s rally has gathered pace in the last 24 hours, other major cryptocurrencies have put on a better show.\n","\n","Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, found bids near $9,100 during the Asian trading hours on Wednesday and rose to a fresh three-month high of $9,755 during the late U.S. session.\n","\n","The convincing break above $9,600, a level from which bitcoin turn lower earlier this week, has revived the immediate bullish view aborted by Monday’s doji candle.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,615, representing a 4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.\n","\n","The crypto market leader, however, is outshone by other top 10 alternative cryptocurrencies (or “altcoins”), according to CoinMarketCap.\n","\n","For instance, ethereum’s ether (ETH) is currently reporting a 9 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s offshoots bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) are flashing double-digit gains, and litecoin (LTC) and EOS are up at least 5 percent each. XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, is up just 0.75 percent.\n","\n","Notably, ETH is trading well above $200 for the first time since September and has gained 63 percent so far this year. Other top coins such as LTC and EOS are reporting 78 percent gains on a year-to-date basis. By comparison, bitcoin is underperforming with a 34 percent gain.\n","\n","Some lesser-known names including ontology (ONT), Qtum (QTUM), and waltonchain (WTC) have also risen more than bitcoin since the start of the year. As a result, bitcoin’s dominance rate – its share of the total crypto market value – has dropped to a seven-month low of 65 percent.\n","\n","The Intermarket performance is suggestive of a bitcoin rally that is, in part at least, being fueled by increased demand for alternative cryptocurrencies.\n","\n","Most of them are denominated in bitcoin. So investors tend to buy bitcoin first and then rotate the money into alternative coins, causing bitcoin’s price to rise relative to the dollar.\n","\n","From a technical perspective, bitcoin’s rally looks to have legs and further gains could be in the offing. That could only bode well for broader markets.\n","\n","Daily chart\n","\n","Bitcoin jumped 5 percent on Wednesday, engulfing the price action observed in the preceding seven days and a sign bullish sentiment is quite strong.\n","\n","Further, it closed (UTC) Wednesday above the lateral resistance of the Nov. 4 high of $9,586, establishing yet another bullish higher high.\n","\n","Lastly, the cryptocurrency convincingly breached Monday’s high of $9,615, invalidating bull fatigue, signaled by that day’s doji candle.\n","\n","All in all, the bulls look to have reinstated their dominance and could soon challenge the psychological resistance of $10,000.\n","\n","Notably, there is no major resistance lined up between the current price and $10,000 that could cap upside. The 14-day relative strength index is still holding below 70, meaning the market isn’t overbought and there is room for further price gains.\n","\n","Dips, if any, could see support at the ascending, or bullish, five- and 10-day averages currently placed at $9,412 and $9,396, respectively.\n","\n","The overall bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above the higher low of $8,213 created on Jan. 24.\n","\n","Weekly chart\n","\n","Bitcoin witnessed a bearish channel breakout four weeks ago.\n","\n","The MACD histogram is now beginning to print higher bars above the zero line – a sign of the strengthening bullish momentum. The RSI is also hovering in the bullish territory above 50 and pointing north.\n","\n","Overall, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to the October high of $10,350.\n","https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/06/crypto-entrepreneur-finally-gets-4point5-million-meal-with-warren-buffett.html\n","https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/06/crypto-entrepreneur-finally-gets-4point5-million-meal-with-warren-buffett.html\n","['Alex Crippen']\n","2020-02-06 00:00:00\n","In a Facebook post , Sun, founder of the Tron cryptocurrency platform, said he and several of his guests had an \"Amazing dinner w/ Warren Buffett finally!\" It included a photo of Buffett and Sun posing along with four other guests.\n","\n","Cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun finally got his $4.6 million charity auction dinner with Warren Buffett last month.\n","\n","Justin Sun had a charity dinner with Warren Buffett along with Sun's guests.\n","\n","Sun also posted photos of gifts he presented to Buffett including one bitcoin , \"safely stored\" in a Samsung Galaxy Fold. \"Since I gifted him this #Bitcoin, $BTC has increased 16%!

But in an order this week, incorporating her reasoning from a Jan. 28 hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Chris McAliley said UnitedCorp’s lawyers at Akerman still have a long way to go to make a case. The judge dismissed the case without prejudice, giving the company until Feb. 28 to file an amended complaint but warning that she doesn’t yet see how the alleged scheme impeded competition.\n","\n","UnitedCorp CEO Benoit Laliberte told me the company fully intends to accept Judge McAliley’s invitation to address her concerns. “This industry needs the U.S. justice system to start applying laws,” he said.\n","\n","The company, represented by Akerman, claims that an international coalition - Chinese cryptocurrency mining hardware specialists, crypto software developers, a Tokyo-based Bitcoin investor and the operator of a well-known Bitcoin exchange – conspired to “hijack” the Bitcoin Cash network. UnitedCorp had invested heavily in 2017 in both hardware and software to run data centers mining for Bitcoin Cash. In 2018, the Bitcoin Cash network was scheduled for an upgrade. The crypto community referred to the upgrade as a “hard fork”: The protocols, or “node” that UnitedCorp (and many other miners) used were not compatible with another widely used node for mining Bitcoin Cash. Under the guiding principle of cryptocurrency and blockchain – which relies on the theory that decentralization prevents corruption of the market – data miners were to pick their preferred node for the network upgrade, allowing the community to decide the future of the network.\n","\n","But according to UnitedCorp’s complaint, the defendants rigged the process. The company claimed that Bitcoin investor Roger Ver and his company Bitcoin.com “rented” Chinese servers to tilt the competition. The suit additionally alleged that cryptocurrency developers then set up “checkpoints” to lock in that preferred node, preventing other users from controlling the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, or virtual ledger, and averting future “hard fork” upgrades. To cap off the alleged scheme, the complaint said, the key Bitcoin exchange Kraken sided with Ver. The form of Bitcoin Cash that had been mined by UnitedCorp ended up being delisted from the Kraken exchange.\n","\n","UnitedCorp claimed the purported scheme violated U.S. antitrust laws and a variety of Florida laws. The company also argued that the alleged conspiracy made a mockery of the crypto tenet of decentralization. “Making a centralized checkpoint that destroys the core principle of decentralized consensus was a significant and fundamental change to the blockchain,” the complaint said.\n","\n","All of the defendants who were properly served with the complaint moved to dismiss the suit. I’ll home in on the motion filed by Bitcoin.com’s Ver, because his counsel Ian Simmons of O’Melveny & Myers took the lead for defendants at the Jan. 28 hearing before Judge McAliley. (O’Melveny also represents one of the developers that allegedly created a checkpoint to lock out UnitedCorp’s node. The Bitcoin exchange operator Kraken is represented by Kobre & Kim. The Chinese server defendants grouped under the name Bitmain have Jones Day.) Ver’s filing argued that UnitedCorp’s complaint is completely devoid of specific evidence that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy. There’s no assertion that they even communicated with one another about the “deeply implausible” scheme alleged by UnitedCorp, Ver said. The more plausible explanation for the success of the protocol they supported is that all of the entities named as defendants acted independently to assure the future of the Bitcoin Cash node they preferred. “This is what competition is about,” the brief said.\n","\n","At the hearing before Judge McAliley, O’Melveny’s Simmons provided a metaphor for the Bitcoin Cash “hard fork.” He described a group of 100 pioneers trekking together until they come to a mountain. Twenty members of the group decide to try to dig their way through the mountain. The other 80 opt to go around. That’s what happened when Bitcoin Cash miners picked between the node favored by UnitedCorp and that preferred by Ver: They voted with their feet, and more picked to travel Ver’s route.\n","\n","And according to Ver counsel Simmons, the ultimate evidence against UnitedCorp’s antitrust theory is that its Bitcoin Cash node is still operating. The currency isn’t listed on the Kraken exchange, but it’s still out there, Simmons said. “We now have more blockchains, more diversity in the marketplace than we had before,” he told the judge.\n","\n","The O’Melveny lawyer specifically argued that UnitedCorp can’t show a per se violation of antitrust law because its allegations didn’t match case law on what constitutes overtly anticompetitive conduct, like price-fixing, market allocation or bid-rigging. UnitedCorp itself, he said, described its case as the first of its kind – the first attempt to police a cryptocurrency market for allegedly anticompetitive conduct. Almost by definition, Simmons said, a novel antitrust theory can’t be a per se violation.\n","\n","Simmons said the complaint also failed to meet the criteria for showing an antitrust violation under the rule of reason. UnitedCorp, he said, didn’t plead a relevant product or geographic market, didn’t allege that the defendants controlled a relevant market and didn’t allege a restraint on competition. “They’ve alleged greater diversity in competition,” he said. “They’ve alleged more voice, rather than less voice. There’s not a diminution with the fork.”\n","\n","UnitedCorp counsel Brian Miller of Akerman harkened back to Simmons’ pioneer analogy to explain why the alleged scheme was anticompetitive. What Simmons didn’t mention, he said, was that one group of pioneers – like Ver and his alleged co-conspirators – brought in a squad of Chinese workers to help them blast through the mountain, and then set up a roadblock on the other side to block the pioneers who traveled a different route. With those two steps, Miller said, Ver and the other defendants boxed out competitors like UnitedCorp.\n","\n","At the end of the hearing, Judge McAliley told UnitedCorp’s lawyers that she “didn’t see how” they could plead a per se violation of federal antitrust law, in part because the industry is too young to provide context for the suit’s allegations and in part because they had not plausibly alleged that the defendants were acting in parallel. She also said she needed a better explanation of the relevant market and for why the rental of Chinese servers was anticompetitive. “I don’t think you have facts that plausibly establish harm to competition,” she said.\n","\n","UnitedCorp CEO Laliberte said he and his lawyers are confident they can make their case in an amended complaint. He was encouraged, he said, by Judge McAliley’s thorough preparation for the hearing and deep interest in the case – which is just what cryptocurrency needs. “This is the future of money,” he said. “The decentralized environment is brilliant but you need laws … We need a chance for the court system to set some rules.”\n","https://cryptobriefing.com/bakkts-bitcoin-payment-horizon-buyout/\n","https://cryptobriefing.com/bakkts-bitcoin-payment-horizon-buyout/\n","['Mike Dalton']\n","2020-02-06 20:10:32+00:00\n","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.\n","\n","Share this article\n","\n","Bakkt is planning to purchase Bridge2 Solutions, a customer loyalty and rewards service, as part of its plans to offer a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-powered payment app in the near future.\n","\n","The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) revealed details in a Feb 5. press release:\n","\n","When Bridge2 Solutions ultimately joins Bakkt, the strategic combination will accelerate the development of the Bakkt consumer application, which will provide digital asset aggregation, conversion and payments through a single platform for consumers around the world.\n","\n","This acquisition is part of Bakkt’s shift toward consumer services.

Anything less would be considered a “failure,” they said.\n","\n","In an “Ask Me Anything” Reddit discussion held Wednesday, the Eth 2.0 team said the network won’t launch until three clients can run testnets consistently for a minimum of eight weeks. AMA participants included ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Eth 2.0 researchers Danny Ryan and Justin Drake.\n","\n","“I have 95% confidence we will launch in 2020,” Drake wrote.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","Eth 2.0, the next iteration of the world’s leading smart-contract blockchain, promises higher transaction throughput and a new security model under Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Often called Serenity, Eth 2.0 has been in the works since ethereum’s launch in 2015 but has been slow to get off the ground due to the highly technical nature of the endeavor.\n","\n","The launch for Eth 2.0 was first slated for January 2020 and then an undisclosed date in Q2 2020. Developers are now eyeing the network’s fifth anniversary, July 30, 2020, for Eth 2.0’s debut. “Phase 0 will certainly launch in 2020. Audits are out and testnets are getting stronger every week,” Ryan said in the discussion thread. “I don’t see a reality in which Phase 0 does not launch in 2020.”\n","\n","Ryan and Buterin said they believe Eth 2.0 could deploy Phase 0, the Beacon Chain, which acts as a general manager of Eth 2.0’s PoS system, on only two stable clients. Other Eth 2.0 researchers are opting for a more conservative approach, however.\n","\n","At the time of ethereum’s debut in 2015, the Parity client launched after Geth, leading to the validator set swinging disproportionately toward the latter client, at an 80-20 tilt, Drake said. “Parity never managed to catch up with Geth,” he added.\n","\n","Regardless of the launch date, Phase 0 and Phase 1 are 99 and 90 percent complete, respectively, Ryan said. Phase 1 will link ETH holders who have staked their assets to the Beacon Chain, joining the ribs to the backbone of the new network.\n","\n","Third-party code audits and testnets – such as a lite client capable of being run on an Android smartphone demoed by Ethereum developer Nimbus on Tuesday – remain the outstanding tasks, Eth 2.0 researcher Diederik Loerakker said.\n","\n","Spring cleaning\n","\n","The coming months should also feature one major update for ethereum coin holders looking to participate in Eth 2.0’s launch: staking contracts.\n","\n","As a PoS network, asset holders are rewarded for pledging their coin holdings to protect and validate the network. Eth 2.0 will require 32 ETH, currently valued around $6,400, to participate as a validator.\n","\n","Contracts for staking ether (ETH) are under audit with an announcement expected this spring at a major ethereum event, Ryan said. The team said the number of validators could run into the millions with one researcher claiming up to 10 percent of ether’s supply, which has a current market cap of $23 billion, could be staked on Eth 2.0.\n","\n","Finally, the Eth 2.0 team continues to examine how to package the current ethereum network, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network, into Eth 2.0.\n","\n","Dubbed “Eth 1.5”, two options have been proposed: transitioning Eth 1.x into “stateless clients,” as detailed in a December blog post from Buterin, or merging Eth 1.x into the Eth 2.0’s Beacon Chain “as is.”\n","\n","In short, the current ethereum blockchain can either be trimmed into digital receipts proving the authenticity of old PoW transactions or Eth 1.x can work within Eth 2.0 through interoperability bridges until the new chain is fully built out.\n","https://www.coindesk.com/blockstack-nodes-will-be-paid-in-btc-not-stx-to-secure-the-network\n","https://www.coindesk.com/blockstack-nodes-will-be-paid-in-btc-not-stx-to-secure-the-network\n","[]\n","2020-02-06 16:00:11+00:00\n","Blockstack is giving its long-term holders a new way to earn bitcoin.\n","\n","Announced Thursday, the decentralized-web startup is rolling out a consensus mechanism that essentially presents a fresh use case for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency.\n","\n","When version 2.0 of Blockstack’s Stacks blockchain comes out, miners on the network will need to post BTC to mine a block. That BTC will then get shared with nodes maintaining a copy of the ledger.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","“We accept bitcoin as the most secure blockchain in the world. We accept a world where this will continue to be the case,” Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk in a phone call.\n","\n","The Stacks blockchain, which aims to put user data in the hands of users, is designed so apps can be built without central data storage. Apps can point to where to look for user data, and these pointers are stored on the Stacks blockchain. STX tokens are needed to participate in the chain.\n","\n","To prevent spamming, or Sybil, attacks, all cryptocurrencies require some cost for writing new blocks. Bitcoin did this first by essentially requiring miners to spend electricity to participate, with its Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. By requiring miners to buy bitcoin and turn that over to the network to participate, Blockstack thinks it has found an ample cost to help prevent malicious entries.\n","\n","How it works\n","\n","Called Proof-of-Transfer (or PoX in the new Blockstack white paper describing the mechanism), the new consensus protocol has two kinds of participants: miners and stackers.\n","\n","“PoX can help to solve a bootstrapping problem for new blockchains,” the white paper states. “Participation rewards in a separate, potentially more stable, base cryptocurrency can be a better incentive for encouraging initial participation than offering participation rewards in a new cryptocurrency.”\n","\n","Miners write blocks and earn STX tokens in exchange for their BTC – at a rate of 500 STX per block. That BTC will be distributed among the stackers, who will be keeping a copy of the blockchain and also voting on which version of the chain miners should mine on.\n","\n","Blockstack distinguishes this new approach from Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because node participants don’t have to put any of their assets at risk to participate, beyond the opportunity cost of agreeing to lock up their STX for some set amount of time.\n","\n","“Proof of Transfer is a proposed design that uses Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) to launch new blockchains that are anchored in Bitcoin’s security,” Blockstack wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance. “Further, PoX can give incentives to earn Bitcoin rewards to participants of such new blockchains. Such Bitcoin rewards were not possible before PoX. These rewards can potentially be used for use cases like consensus participation, ecosystem developer funds, incentives for specific players, etc.”\n","\n","To serve as a stacker won’t be cheap, though. It will take roughly $10,000 in STX to participate, Ali said, but like other chains with similar arrangements users won’t need to actually have that much. They can delegate to a service that maintains the node, in exchange for agreeing to lock up STX in collaboration with the node operator.\n","\n","Tezos has this with its “bakers” and EOS has effectively turned staking eos to vote for validators into a money-making proposition as well, as we previously reported.\n","\n","What’s new with PoX, though, is participants in the network locking up the native token don’t earn the native token for doing so. They earn BTC.\n","\n","“I think the market and the entrepreneurs are starting to recognize that bitcoin is the strongest computing network in the world and therefore you can build things on top of it,” Anthony Pompliano, partner at Morgan Creek Digital, told CoinDesk.\n","\n","But, given the rough outline of the proposal, Pompliano wasn’t sure the bitcoin community would get behind it.\n","\n","What’s in it for miners?\n","\n","Mining the Stacks blockchain will be possible with a normal internet connection and computer, Ali said. Miners will just need to watch the price of STX and the price of BTC to assess whether continued participation fits their risk profile.\n","\n","“In our process of mining, the miners can model PoX mining as almost as an exchange,” Ali said. This should have some sort of arbitrage advantage early on but if all goes well that difference should shrink as participation increases, he added.\n","\n","Miners’ income opportunities will also go up when Blockstack is ready to release its smart contract language, Clarity. Once miners activate it, they will start earning smart-contract fees. Ali argues Stacks may be attractive for developers looking to use smart contracts because they will be able to get extremely precise cost estimates for their code.\n","\n","Blockstack will not participate in mining. The current plan, Ali said, is that once 20 miners activate the new version of the software, Blockstack 2.0 will go live. Miners will continue to have the ultimate decision about upgrades on the network.\n","\n","The current version of Stacks operates atop bitcoin with the vision to eventually migrate out as its own PoW chain. This completely changes with version 2.0.\n","\n","“With this thing, we basically need to never migrate from bitcoin,” Ali said.\n","https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitcoin-ira-reports-11-6-average-net-return-for-self-directed-investors-in-the-first-month-of-2020--300999997.html\n","https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitcoin-ira-reports-11-6-average-net-return-for-self-directed-investors-in-the-first-month-of-2020--300999997.html\n","['Bitcoin Ira']\n","None\n","LOS ANGELES, Feb. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Bitcoin IRA, the world's first, largest and most secure digital asset IRA technology platform that allows clients to purchase cryptocurrencies, gold and other digital assets for their retirement accounts, today announced that its clients are seeing strong returns by adding cryptocurrency to their retirement accounts.\n","\n","In just the first month of 2020, the average return for all clients who purchased cryptocurrency anytime in January 2020 was 11.6%.

It could have important implications for the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n","\n","RSK is a smart contract platform attached as a sidechain to the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. It uses a wrapped version of Bitcoin called rBTC as its native token. Users acquire the token by depositing BTC into RSK’s bridge wallet, which works as a two-way peg.\n","\n","The team has now opened a similar bridge for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows a two-way transfer of any token between the RSK and Ethereum ecosystems. This means that Ethereum users can transact with wrapped representations of RSK’s rBTC and RIF tokens, thus gaining indirect exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The same goes for RSK users, who are exposed to Ethereum-based stablecoins such as DAI.\n","\n","How does it work?\n","\n","When a user deposits a token from either blockchain to an address provided by RSK, an equivalent amount of the appropriate Side Token is minted in the other chain. The Side Token is written according to the ERC-777 specification, a newer token standard that is backward-compatible with the highly common ERC-20 specification.\n","\n","Any standard token on either blockchain can be ported to the other through the bridge. The total supply does not change from this operation, as the original tokens are locked up until their mirror image is redeemed.\n","\n","Cointelegraph reached out to Adrian Eidelman, RSK Strategist at parent company IOVLabs. He explained in more detail how the bridge works, revealing that the current system is not yet fully decentralized.\n","\n","Eidelman said that to connect the two blockchains together, a federation of “well-known and respected community members” oversees the peg process. The procedure is triggered when developers on either chain interact with the bridge smart contract. Using Ethereum as an example, he explained what happens:\n","\n","“The original tokens will now be locked on the Ethereum chain, and an “event” is created. At this point, the federation initiates the bridge and sends the information to the RSK chain. Once 50% or more of the federates have voted for the same transaction — the bridge on the RSK chain creates RRC20 tokens for the same amount locked on Ethereum.”\n","\n","The team does not consider this a fully decentralized measure, but Eidelman reassured that the system should reach “full decentralization” by the end of Q3 2020.\n","\n","Potential for Bitcoin DeFi\n","\n","The DeFi movement is largely limited to Ethereum and its token ecosystem, where it recently surpassed $1 billion in locked assets. ETH is used as the main collateral asset to generate the DAI stablecoin through its complex lending system. Nevertheless, Bitcoin-based DeFi is often considered DeFi’s next frontier. In a November 2019 interview with The Spartan Group, MakerDAO’s founder Rune Christensen said:\n","\n","“When it comes to a solid decentralized collateral, I think ETH is king. The only thing that can come close to ETH in terms of its importance is of course Bitcoin.”\n","\n","But Bitcoin has very limited smart contract functionality, which severely limits this use case. Christensen noted that porting Bitcoin into Ethereum would allow for it to be used as collateral, pointing to existing solutions such as Wrapped BTC (WBTC).\n","\n","However, WBTC’s transfer process is custodial, instead of being a decentralized atomic swap. He explained that “it is essentially impossible to build more decentralized cross-chain solutions.”\n","\n","The only available solution, according to Christensen, is to have many providers of Bitcoin on Ethereum:\n","\n","“The way that we have to try to solve that with Maker is rather than just for WBTC to be the sole source of Bitcoin on Ethereum, we want to have hundreds of different versions of wrapped Bitcoin.”\n","\n","Thus the release of RSK’s Ethereum bridge could be an additional step toward Bitcoin-collateralized DAI living on Ethereum.\n","\n","Though Maker is the biggest decentralized stablecoin provider, it is not the only one. Money on Chain is a similar project built on RSK, which uses rBTC for collateral. The project already expressed interest in using the RSK bridge to enter the Ethereum ecosystem.\n","\n","RSK also sees a potential use case for Ethereum DeFi to transfer to its platform. Eidelman claimed that the Ethereum market is “experiencing many difficulties,” pointing to higher fees and lower capacity. The project sees itself as an extension of Bitcoin, which it believes is the “strongest ecosystem in the blockchain space.” Despite the close association, RSK is still its own network.\n","\n","Bitcoin DeFi could be close, but it seems unlikely that it will be based on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n","https://www.coindesk.com/rsk-launches-interoperability-bridge-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum\n","https://www.coindesk.com/rsk-launches-interoperability-bridge-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum\n","[]\n","2020-02-07 10:06:40+00:00\n","The parent company behind the bitcoin-based smart contract platform RSK has launched a token bridge joining it to ethereum.\n","\n","Gibraltar-based developer IOV Labs said this week its newly released interoperability bridge would allow users to cross RSK- and ethereum-based digital assets, including ether and ERC-20 tokens, across the different protocols.\n","\n","When a user transfers tokens, the bridge’s smart contract locks the originals and mints a corresponding amount of new tokens on the other chain. Using the system, ether-based tokens can be transformed into RSK’s RRC20 tokens, which conversely can be turned into ethereum ERC777 tokens.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","Interoperability protocols make it easier for projects to operate on different blockchains. Decentralized apps (dapps) can cater to a broader base of users, who would otherwise remain siloed in closed networks, and projects can leverage specific characteristics of different blockchains simultaneously.\n","\n","“Interoperability has been a cornerstone of the RSK vision from the start,” explained Adrian Eidelman, RSK Strategist at IOV Labs. “We believe being able to offer Bitcoin’s benefits to Ethereum users and to connect these respective developer communities is a crucial step for the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.”\n","\n","There are other protocols offering interoperability between bitcoin and ethereum: Wanchain launched a token bridge between the two networks in 2018. Edelman told CoinDesk that while Wanchain focuses on connecting blockchains by being a “middleman,” RSK is different in that it actually combines the networks, allowing both ecosystems to leverage the other’s strengths.\n","\n","Bitcoin stablecoin protocol Money on Chain, which uses bitcoin as collateral for new tokens, has already said it will use the new RSK bridge to cross its stablecoins onto the ethereum ecosystem. The project’s co-founder Max Carjuzaa said the new interoperability would combine the security and “global recognition of Bitcoin with the vibrant DeFi ecosystem currently developed in Ethereum.”\n","https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/bitcoin-and-crypto-guide/top-10-cryptocurrency-gurus-they-shaped-the-bitcoin-and-blockchain-space/\n","https://cryptobriefing.com/largest-cryptocurrency-liquidity-provider-taps-security-firm-fireblocks/\n","https://cryptobriefing.com/largest-cryptocurrency-liquidity-provider-taps-security-firm-fireblocks/\n","['Paul De Havilland']\n","2020-02-07 15:04:21+00:00\n","Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.\n","\n","Share this article\n","\n","Digital asset storage, transfer, and issuing platform Fireblocks has announced today that it is partnering with B2C2, the world’s largest cryptocurrency liquidity provider.\n","\n","Fireblocks Focuses on Institutional Clients\n","\n","B2C2 will deploy Fireblocks to protect billions of dollars in digital assets and secure more than 10,000 OTC trades daily.\n","\n","Utilizing Fireblocks’ API, B2C2 can now securely and instantly execute large value settlements with its institutional clients.

It hit us that making rewards cash-like would be a step in that direction.”\n","\n","As reported this week, ICE agreed to acquire Bridge2 Solutions, a provider of loyalty solutions for merchants and consumers. When Bridge2 Solutions ultimately joins Bakkt, the strategic combination will accelerate the development of the Bakkt consumer application, which will provide digital asset aggregation, conversion, and payments through a single platform for consumers around the world, the company said.\n","\n","Now, ICE revealed more details. Bridge2 operates a range of the country’s biggest loyalty redemption sites, which “hold a combined total of USD 60 billion ready-to-go rewards,” Fortune reported.\n","\n","And ICE plans to develop an app with Bridge2 that would do away with credit card providers and banks, in favor of sponsor-issued digital credit cards that carry a merchant’s brand.\n","\n","The companies say they are “testing a pilot program” for the app, which will be called Loyalty Pay. The app could allow users to claim rewards in four different categories.\n","\n","An image provided to the media outlet by Bakkt shows a mock-up for a potential Loyalty Pay wallet, which shows a user’s funds divided into four sections, one of which is labeled “crypto.” The other three are “cash, “rewards” and “in-game” (likely currencies and tokens that can be used to buy in-game items and upgrade characters).\n","\n","Source: a screenshot\n","\n","Fortune wrote,\n","\n","“Folks could not only make purchases with the app using cash or bitcoin but also seamlessly transfer money from one category to another. “\n","\n","In a recent earnings call, Sprecher stated that “the next big hurdle for the company will be getting the app into consumer hands.”\n","\n","It would mean that a share of the \"USD 60 billion ready-to-go rewards,\" held by Bridge2, might be eventually converted into cryptocurrencies.\n","\n","The CEO also said that Bakkt would be “looking at consumer adoption more than revenue or expense” in 2020, and enthused that Bridge 2 “has a revenue stream both from trading and from the operation of all these rewards programs for 4,500 companies.”\n","\n","He added,\n","\n","“[The focus will be] not so much revenue and bottom line. It is broad adoption, I think, for 2020 that we'll be looking toward.”\n","\n","The CEO opined that a number of firms that run rewards programs were keen to attract younger customers – and could be keen to use crypto rewards as an incentive. He claimed that he was having “conversations across a broad range of industries” on the matter.\n","\n","Sprecher said that companies were now asking themselves if “more millennials can be attracted to” Bridge2 partner companies “by virtue of having cryptocurrency in their ecosystem.”\n","https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pawnhubio-becomes-hong-kongs-first-fully-licensed-crypto-lender-301001221.html\n","https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pawnhubio-becomes-hong-kongs-first-fully-licensed-crypto-lender-301001221.html\n","[]\n","None\n","HONG KONG, Feb. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Hong Kong-based crypto lending firm PawnHub.io is the first company of its type to obtain a license from the Government of Hong Kong.

This week a digital token, Trump 2020 with the symbol TRUMP, launched courtesy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n","\n","FTX says the new token will work like a futures contract, allowing traders to take long positions (Trump wins) or short ones (total loser).\n","\n","“TRUMP expires to $1 if Donald Trump wins the 2020 U.S. presidential general election, and $0 otherwise,” FTX says in a posting on its website.\n","\n","Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy\n","\n","Some online sites, such as Oddschecker.com, have set up venues to bet on the coming election, which is shaping up to be historic: Trump is expected to be the first incumbent president to face voters following an impeachment trial. The president was acquitted Wednesday by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate of impeachment articles brought by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.\n","\n","But the new FTX contract might represent the crypto industry’s first attempt to cash in on the polarized voter climate surrounding Trump’s 2020 prospects.\n","\n","Theoretically, the token’s price should track roughly in line with the perceived odds of a Trump victory.\n","\n","“If you think there’s a 52 percent chance of Trump winning, then TRUMP should trade at $0.52,” according to FTX. “Buying below there would be good, as would selling above $0.52.”\n","\n","The token, which went live earlier this week, is currently trading at 62 cents after Trump’s acquittal, implying a 62 percent chance he’ll get four more years in Washington.\n","\n","FTX is owned by a parent company based in Antigua and Barbuda, according to the firm’s website.

(Bitcoin is up 36 percent so far this year to about $9,800, after the price nearly doubled in 2019.)\n","\n","“The risk profile of TRUMP is different from BTC,” according to the website. “It has significantly higher chances of making a large move (to $0 or $1).”\n","https://cryptoslate.com/btse-leaves-dubai-for-british-islands-why-crypto-businesses-still-havent-found-their-regulatory-utopia/\n","https://cryptoslate.com/btse-leaves-dubai-for-british-islands-why-crypto-businesses-still-havent-found-their-regulatory-utopia/\n","['Jonnie Emsley']\n","2020-02-07 09:30:02+00:00\n","Crypto exchange BTSE has shifted its operations out of Dubai, claiming that regulators in countries with “non-permissive legal systems” are holding back the mass adoption of cryptocurrency with their inaction and broken promises. The move comes as the latest in a global game of musical chairs by crypto businesses, who have little choice but to relocate in the face of regulatory uncertainty.\n","\n","The spot, futures, and fiat-crypto/crypto-fiat exchange have now joined Tether, Bitfinex, and other firms headquartered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), on account of BVI’s having a “permissive legal system” that is “more welcoming to innovation,” BTSE Co-Founder Jonathan Leong told CryptoSlate. He elaborated:\n","\n","“Regulatory uncertainty is holding back cryptocurrency progress in countries with non-permissive legal systems. Exchanges have to plan ahead and it’s pretty difficult when a jurisdiction has unclear rules and regulations. Malta, for example, made a lot of promises and in the end their framework was very narrow and not particularly useful. These are the greatest barriers to more infrastructure being built to support and encourage long-term mass adoption of crypto.”\n","\n","A post on the BTSE blog said the exchange had endured nearly two years of regulatory uncertainty in Dubai before the decision was made to pull the plug, after regulators failed to deliver on a long-promised legislative framework for cryptocurrencies (a framework that had originally enticed the startup to set up shop in the UAE in March 2018). The exchange has been “gradually transitioning” to the BVI since October 2019.\n","\n","Regulators failing to deliver the goods\n","\n","Leong said exchanges could not plan ahead in jurisdictions with “unclear rules and regulations,” and pointed to Malta — widely held up as one of the world’s most progressive regulatory regimes for blockchain and crypto—as an example of a place that had “made a lot of promises” but ultimately failed to deliver. The BTSE blog post stated:\n","\n","“As many in the cryptocurrency space are well aware, crypto regulations are far from stable and often very uncertain, even when regulations in a region have already been formed. Malta presents an example of a country that was once hailed as a new crypto haven, but has made little regulatory progress.”\n","\n","The tiny island nation began championing itself in 2018 as “The Blockchain Island” after passing a set of bills regulating cryptocurrencies and the companies that deal in them and attracting two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges by daily volume, Binance, and OKEx, into setting up their operational bases in Malta. By early 2019, exchanges based in Malta accounted for the majority of crypto trading volume globally.\n","\n","Related: Prime Minister of Malta: Crypto is the Inevitable Future, ‘Blockchain Island’ is a Calculated Risk\n","\n","But despite the Maltese government’s beckoning stance as a crypto utopia, there have been signs that crypto businesses are facing a different reality down on the ground.\n","\n","In March last year “dozens” of crypto firms told the Times of Malta that they had been unable to open bank accounts on the Mediterranean island after having shifted operations there, with banks explaining that cryptocurrency was outside their “risk appetite.”\n","\n","Then in August, Zebpay, one of India’s top crypto exchanges, allegedly shuttered its Malta headquarters just 11 months after having shifted to the Mediterranean island and moved operations to Singapore.\n","\n","Shortly after in October, another exchange, Bittrex, announced it would be moving its headquarters from Malta to Liechtenstein. While no official explanation was given, the move came just weeks after the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) said it would start actively monitoring crypto exchanges for anti-money laundering (AML), and days after Bittrex suspended operations for customers based in 31 countries, many of which are deemed high-risk by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n","\n","The MFSA would look to have its hands tied with the broader AML crackdown on crypto seen in financial strongholds like the U.S. and U.K., however, highlighting a sobering reality: we are still waiting for a progressive and conclusive directive on cryptocurrency from a major power.\n","\n","Get an edge on the cryptoasset market Access more crypto insights and context in every article as a paid member of CryptoSlate Edge.

More “normies” might use bitcoin if the user experience (UX) was better, if – in Silicon Valley tech speak – they were “delighted” to use the apps and felt “empowered” by them, she argued.\n","\n","Jin’s comments at the two-day event spoke to the difficulty of moving the needle on crypto adoption, even with 11 years under bitcoin’s belt.\n","\n","“Bitcoin UX improved a lot [over the years]. But there are ways we can improve that to push bitcoin even further,” Jin, Blockstream’s director of UX, said. She argued that most developers try to build an app with the features they want themselves, which isn’t necessarily what the average Joe is looking for.\n","\n","UX is often overlooked in bitcoin’s often very technical community. Jin argued that bitcoiners are fascinated by the new currency for a variety of reasons: monetary revolution, technological exploration and getting rich. (She’s in it for all three, she said.)\n","\n","“I’m trying to help fix the user experience here because if we don’t do that, these three things can’t happen,” Jin said.\n","\n","Less-confusing bitcoin accounts\n","\n","With the halving around the corner, it could be a particularly good time to focus on improving bitcoin’s user experience.\n","\n","If the price goes up (which is still a big “if” that people are debating profusely), it could bring in a lot of new users, as is the pattern for bitcoin over the past decade.\n","\n","“Think of it like ‘Hungry Hungry Hippos,'” Coinfloor exchange founder and CEO Obi Nwosu said in a panel, referencing the 1980s children’s game. “When it comes, each exchange will be trying to get as many customers as possible. We need a service that deals with their requirements,” he added, nodding to Jin’s talk.\n","\n","One little-known proposal discussed at the event was to make memorizing bitcoin addresses as easy as memorizing a phone number.\n","\n","Right now that’s far from the case. Instead of being fewer than 10 digits, bitcoin addresses, where bitcoin is stored and transaction IDs are long, random strings of letters and numbers.\n","\n","“There is no way anyone can memorize it – unless you’re someone who memorizes digits of pi for fun. These IDs are always communicated by copy and paste,” bitcoin developer and educator Jimmy Song said.\n","\n","That’s why, when he saw a proposal for EasyPaySy posted to the bitcoin developer email list, he was intrigued. EasyPaySy allows these accounts to be represented in a much easier form, as short and human-readable as a phone number or as readable as an email address.\n","\n","This approach isn’t without downsides.\n","\n","It would require more data to be stored on the bitcoin blockchain (the more slimmed down, the easier it is for more users to run). Plus, users potentially have to spend more time backing up such accounts. One attendee argued that the debacle involving economist and bitcoin critic Peter Schiff recently “losing his bitcoin password” showed that taking care of one’s bitcoin is already hard enough as is for many people.\n","\n","Still, Song argued that the benefits might outweigh the disadvantages.\n","\n","Attendees of 2020's Advancing Bitcoin conference. (Photo by Alyssa Hertig for CoinDesk)\n","\n","From the bottom up\n","\n","But user-facing improvements aren’t the only changes being considered. Many UX improvements start at the lowest levels of the bitcoin code.\n","\n","The faster developers can build new features, the faster they can bubble up to users. This realm of UX problems was probably the biggest focus of Advancing Bitcoin.\n","\n","One such improvement revolves around “testnet,” a network that’s like a dummy clone of bitcoin where developers test their apps and new bitcoin features to get a better idea of how they’ll work in the real world.\n","\n","Bitcoin Core contributor Kalle Alm has been building SigNet, an alternative that he describes as “testnet, but without all the broken parts.” The network is notoriously unreliable and “reorgs” all the time, an event where transactions that were considered legit for a short time, aren’t anymore. This bump is much less common on the real bitcoin network.\n","\n","Plus, there are people mining testnet coins and earning no money from it, since the mined dummy coins are supposed to be free. Alm argues there isn’t a point to this, since decentralization, achieved with the help of mining, isn’t really required on testnet.\n","\n","“I don’t even know what [testnet miners] are doing. No government is gonna come in and say, ‘Give me the test coins!'” Alm said.\n","\n","With these problems fixed, Alm thinks SigNet could play a big role in testing network-wide features added to bitcoin. For example, developers could soon use it to test Schnorr and Taproot, a privacy and scalability-focused bundle of changes that’s been making progress this year.\n","\n","But SigNet is just the tip of the iceberg. New bitcoin smart contract language Miniscript, unveiled last year, was the subject of several talks at the conference.

Asian nations have a high degree of technological prowess and great enthusiasm for cryptocurrency and blockchain projects.\n","\n","Many Asian nations are home to some of the largest crypto-markets, along with some of the most forward-thinking crypto-asset friendly regulations. Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong have all passed legislation to make their jurisdiction more appealing to internet money-startups.\n","\n","Pawnhub’s foray into crypto-lending could be huge. The crypto-lending industry has become one of the fastest and most profitable sub-sectors of the overall crypto-asset investment climate of the last 2 years.\n","\n","Pawnhub was able to secure a government license in Hong Kong, as well as announced that they will be partnering with a leading US crypto-asset custody firm, in order to offer insurance of up to $100 million, anywhere in the world, to cover their client’s Bitcoin holdings.\n","\n","Digital currency lending has been growing at an alarming pace, however, it is still very tiny when compared to traditional lending markets.

And unlike the average, fickle altcoin project, Decred’s message has been clear since 2016: Be a better Bitcoin.\n","\n","But how close has it come to achieving this objective? Crypto Briefing asked two of the protocol’s most active researchers to find out.\n","\n","A 10,000 Foot Perspective\n","\n","The hybrid consensus mechanism used to mine each and every Decred (DCR) token is one of the protocol’s strongest selling points.\n","\n","Enthusiasts have indicated time and again that this mechanism is more secure than networks using exclusively one or the other. Understanding how it operates is relatively straightforward.\n","\n","Like Bitcoin, miners in the Decred network work to produce blocks. Unlike Bitcoin, Decred’s blocks must be again verified by stakeholders, or in Decred parlance, PoS ticket holders. These tickets can be purchased with DCR tokens in an open auction. Every Decred block announces 20 tickets for sale.\n","\n","At the time of press, one ticket currently costs an estimated 135.11 DCR, or ~$2,868. Token holders are allowed to bid on as many tickets as they can afford.\n","\n","To participate, DCR holders must first wait for the Decred network to announce an open bid on a ticket via users’ wallet software. Interested parties then place their bid and wait for the miners to include it in an upcoming block. The bid joins a pool of bids for the same 20 tickets.\n","\n","Ticket holders still need to wait 24 hours before using their ticket to vote on an incoming block, however.\n","\n","Five PoS tickets in the network are pseudo-randomly selected to validate a mined block. Three of them must validate the block mined for the block to be attached to the blockchain. If this validation fails for whatever reason, the blocks must be mined again.\n","\n","If successful, then the block reward is split three ways: 60% to miners, 30% to winning ticket votes, and 10% to the Decred treasury.\n","\n","One can think of Decred as having added a functional social layer on top of the mining protocol. Token holders, or those most incentivized to benefit from a healthy network, can actively participate in the project’s security. It is in their best interests to behave honestly because it is also the most economically sound choice in this network.\n","\n","Thus, attacking the Decred network is slightly more complicated than a brute force 51% mining attack. Malicious agents would need both a majority of the hashing power and the majority of the tickets in the network.\n","\n","Assuming the cost of mining equipment, market cap, and hashpower is the same as pure-play PoW networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, one analyst, Zubair Zia, concluded in 2018 that “Decred would be ~22 times costlier to attack than Bitcoin and ~9 times more expensive to attack than Etheruem.”\n","\n","The above outline is only the foundation. Since launching this hybrid consensus mechanism, a lot has been added to Decred in the past four years.\n","\n","Decred’s Governance Experiments\n","\n","“I only found Decred in early 2018, so I can only really speak to the past two years,” said Permabull Niño in a Twitter conversation with Crypto Briefing. “The biggest thing for me is how much has been built in that time, which was an extended bear market.”\n","\n","My crypto investment philosophy summarized in a graphic, and why I'm only willing to hold BTC and DCR. Dominant coins within a certain ledger assurance model will be the big winners is my bet pic.twitter.com/JKgMAqtklw — Permabull Niño (@PermabullNino) December 21, 2018\n","\n","More than armchair crypto analysts, both Permabull and Checkmate have been hard at work researching, documenting, and getting the word out about all of the developments happening in Decred. The two have been so prolific, the Decred community has practically employed the duo to be its spokespeople.\n","\n","In the same year that Permabull began digging into the nuances of the cryptocurrency, Decred launched Politeia. The initiative offers additional powers to ticket-voting stakeholders beyond helping with block confirmation. Indeed, the entire vision of the project, not just its security, has been handed over to the community.\n","\n","Stakeholders can lance proposals for 0.1 DCR, and the rest of the community can vote and discuss the proposal through the Politeia portal. Like proposals, it costs 0.1 DCR to create a Politeia account. This cost is in place to prevent the rise of sock puppets and other forms of spam.\n","\n","Proposals fall into two broad categories — those that looking for voter support to make a change to the protocol, or those that hope to draw funding from the Decred Treasury.\n","\n","The latest proposal, for instance, is for a research grant to fund the work of Checkmate and Permabull.\n","\n","“The goal is to build more charts on metrics that are specific to Decred,” Checkmate said in an interview with Crypto Briefing. This data would then be used to better understand Decred’s behavior as well as offer investors a more comprehensive understanding of the project.\n","\n","Checkmate added:\n","\n","“I believe [Decred is] the most important coin next to Bitcoin and want to explore what the data indicates and what the fundamental potential of the project is.”\n","\n","To complete the task, Checkmate, along with Permabull, has asked the community for $17,500 for roughly eight months of work. Critically, this is the second proposal of the same nature; Checkmate asked for $12,000 in July 2019 for similar work. The community voted 92.3% in favor to pursue the research at that time.\n","\n","The first proposal was also an opportunity to corral some of the more active members of the Decred community. This includes Richard Red, Murad Mahmadov, Zubair Zia, and others.\n","\n","Once a proposal is approved by the community, the requisite funds are drawn from the treasury. If one remembers earlier, the treasury is replenished with 10% of the block reward each time a block is mined and validated by voters. At the time of press, the treasury holds 643,405.27025766 DCR, or $13.7 million.\n","\n","Successful proposals have been wide-ranging, too. The community voted on whether to hire Wachsman, a blockchain-focused marketing agency, for instance. Other proposals have included creating video content, developing Decred-integrated ATMs, performing a bug bounty, and setting up a Decred-native decentralized exchange (DEX).\n","\n","As for 2020, Permabull said that he is most excited about the upcoming DEX. “I think a lot of people are sleeping on its potential and over time it will become a key piece of crypto infrastructure,” they said.\n","\n","For Checkmate, Decred is ahead of most other projects entering the decade. “As for fundamental potential of the project, the biggest narratives coming up are privacy, Chainalysis, KYC, security in the face of expanding derivatives (ability to short and 51% attack), funding, and governance,” they said. Concluding:\n","\n","“Decred has solved these issues long before they showed up elsewhere. So far, betting against convention has paid off.”\n","\n","But is it better than Bitcoin yet? The question isn’t yet relevant, according to Permabull.\n","\n","“When Decred is larger in scale, the comparison between it and Bitcoin will be more appropriate.” Instead, Permabull takes solace in another thought. They said:\n","\n","“Bitcoin changed the way I look at money, and Decred changed the way I look at cryptocurrencies.”\n","\n","Whether it will eventually outpace the premier cryptocurrency is pure speculation. But as many throughout the crypto space experiment with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and the challenges of governance, one may not need to look much further than Decred.\n","https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/conflicts-interests-emojis-and-20-crypto-jokes-5723.htm\n","https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/conflicts-interests-emojis-and-20-crypto-jokes-5723.htm\n","['Sead Fadilpašić']\n","None\n","Let's recap what happened in this crypto week. Total value locked in DeFi hit 1 billion! The public war-of-words between the co-founders of the IOTA Foundation took a fresh turn, Bitspark will close due to internal issues despite reporting positive results, but the first phase of Ethereum 2.0 is most likely coming this year. While Mike Novogratz believes ETH, XRP and many other alts are in their 'proving phase,' and Celsius CEO gave three reasons why Bitcoin might reach USD 30K in 2020, we discussed why ICE's acquisition of eBay would be relevant for crypto, and Binance co-owned FTX added TRUMP-2020 futures market. Meanwhile, billions of dollars could be converted into BTC, ETC will have two parallel upgrades, and a lawyer warned not to get too excited about Crypto Mom's ICO plan.\n","\n","What else happened? The South Korean central bank is launching a second CBDC team in what appears to be a direct response to China’s plans to issue a digital yuan, while the banks and financial services providers are turning to blockchain, and the country is inching closer to crypto tax legislation. The head of the Russian Duma’s digital economy commission insisted that crypto and blockchain legislation will be in place before the year’s end, and American Fed said it's looking into the possibility of CBDC issuance. Meanwhile, fourteen of Japan’s biggest banks and securities companies will begin running a pilot for a blockchain-powered inheritance platform. Traditional financial advisors are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about digital assets, and Sony showed their interest in security tokens when they made an indirect, undisclosed investment in Securitize. Meanwhile, North Korean hackers used LinkedIn and Telegram for their USD 7 million DragonEx hack, while MLB players are allegedly among the victims of American crypto fund scam.\n","\n","And more things happened.

Specifically, Coinbase suggests that the premier cryptocurrency will take a massive step towards that end in just 93 days.\n","\n","Many analysts already call Bitcoin ”digital gold”\n","\n","This is not the first time that analysts refer to Bitcoin as ”digital gold”. In fact, the premier cryptocurrency is routinely said to be a digital equivalent of that precious yellow metal. The reasoning behind this is that Bitcoin, much like gold, provides a stable store-of-value.\n","\n","As such, the asset class is able to weather periods of market volatility and uncertainty. Numerous investors also suggest that Bitcoin is a modern store-of-value and, put simply, ”digital gold”. With that said, Coinbase now joins the chorus of those hailing Bitcoin as digital gold and says similarities are increasing.\n","\n","This news came in a Coinbase blog post on February 7th. In it, and in an accompanying tweet-storm, Coinbase went all out promoting Bitcoin as ”digital gold”.\n","\n","Bitcoin halving will make Bitcoin more like digital gold than ever\n","\n","Interestingly, Coinbase also goes into the statistics as to why Bitcoin is approaching a status of digital gold. Additionally, Coinbase also hails the upcoming Bitcoin halving as a critical step towards truly becoming digital gold.\n","\n","The Coinbase post looks at when the gold standard was broken in 1971. Since then, the dollar’s value relative to gold has fallen drastically, which the following chart demonstrates. The value of gold in dollar terms, on the other hand, has risen roughly 4,000% since 1971.\n","\n","Moreover, the key reason as to gold’s enduring and increasing value is its scarcity, and difficulty to acquire (mine). The scarcity of gold means that governments around the world can’t just produce more gold. Instead, gold has a finite supply, and only 190,000 tons have ever been mined.\n","\n","Much like gold, Bitcoin also requires mining and is intentionally scarce. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity actually decreases. This is due to Bitcoin’s ”halving” processes, which take place every fourth year.\n","\n","What will the Bitcoin halving do to the Bitcoin price?\n","\n","Bitcoin’s next halving event will take place on roughly May 14th- or in about 93 days. Many analysts suggest that this occasion could drive the price of Bitcoin higher than ever. The following chart shows the price performance of Bitcoin over the course of the last two halving events.\n","\n","One analyst has said that the halving will lead to a Bitcoin price of $55,000. Just a few days ago, another said that Bitcoin’s halving will boost the premier crypto’s price to $30,000 in 2020.\n","\n","A popular model for measuring how supply rate over total supply affects assets is the ”stock-to-flow” (S2F) measure. What’s more, the Bitcoin halving will effectively double the S2F ratio, due to cutting new supply in half.\n","\n","In conclusion, the Coinbase post points out that Bitcoin’s halving in roughly 93 days will likely make the premier crypto more like ”digital gold” than ever before. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin also comes with a long list of technological advances that make it more efficient than gold.\n","https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/fintech-myths-and-misconceptions-around-p2p-crypto-dealing-in-india-4922471.html\n","https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/fintech-myths-and-misconceptions-around-p2p-crypto-dealing-in-india-4922471.html\n","['Nilanjan Dey']\n","None\n","Nischal Shetty\n","\n","As we live in an era of ‘Fake News’, myths and misconceptions can be seen easily building all around us. Unfortunately, such Fake News can also be found spreading around the cryptocurrency market in India. To give you a contrast, the global market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is more than $250 billion, up from around $190 billion during the beginning of this year. In fact, even the lowest market capitalization after the infamous crypto crash was $102 billion (December 2018).\n","\n","This is when Fake News has eroded substantial investor sentiment from the market. Cryptocurrencies experience volatility just like fiat currencies, however, they are more robust given that they’re backed by technology. Its market capitalization is growing and the only way it has to go is the way up. Just try and imagine its true potential if the crypto market also gathers the support of regular investors. It will be simply remarkable.\n","\n","\n","\n","Crypto trading is illegal in India: This is the biggest myth that circulates within our country around crypto trading. It is false because there’s no regulation at all on cryptocurrencies in India. The Government of India is yet to come up with laws around cryptocurrencies and until then, Indians are free to own and trade in cryptocurrencies. It’s true that the RBI doesn’t allow Indian exchanges to hold bank accounts. But this doesn’t make crypto trading illegal because the power to legalise or criminalise something lies with the government. This particular stance of the Reserve Bank of India’s dates back to 2018 when it disallowed people from depositing in INR. It was an arbitrary measure taken without any prior research or consultation of industry players. Moreover, this move is being challenged in the Supreme Court.\n","\n","\n","\n","So, let us have a look at some of the myths and misconceptions around crypto dealing in India, especially the ones around P2P trade:\n","\n","2. You can be defrauded in a P2P trade: In P2P trade, the INR transaction happens between two individuals, i.e., the buyer pays directly to the seller’s bank account. So, there is a popular myth that despite transferring the crypto (or the money), the other person might not fulfill his/her obligation. This is also not true. In order to check this, the exchange keeps the cryptocurrency in an escrow account and transfers it only when the transaction is confirmed. Even if any dispute arises between the transacting parties, it gets easily resolved.\n","\n","3. P2P is slow and complicated: Well, it’s not. WazirX, for instance, has the world’s first auto-matching P2P engine. So, the interface and experience are similar to the trading exchange. Any transaction takes around 15 minutes on average to get completed.\n","\n","4. P2P is unsafe: Another myth is that the P2P trade is unsafe and there are no measures to guarantee the credibility of traders. Again, this is just a myth. Crypto exchanges have KYC-verified traders, so you know you’re dealing with legitimate traders. Also, an organization (such as the exchange itself) acts as escrow, thereby ensuring that the funds aren’t transferred until the seller confirms receiving the payment.\n","\n","Cryptocurrencies became a global fad over the yesteryears. And why wouldn’t they? Their sheer ingenuity as a novel tech-driven tender and the revolutionary technology backing them, i.e. blockchain, have fueled this trend. These reasons are perhaps why the cryptocurrency market continues to receive high footfall of everyone from technocrats to the general masses. If you have been avoiding the burgeoning market because of these myths and misconceptions, maybe it is time for you to reconsider your decision.\n","https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/02/08/crypto-exchange-kraken-reveals-serious-bitcoin-wallet-flaw/\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-futures-markets-trump-wins-election/\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-futures-markets-trump-wins-election/\n","[]\n","2020-02-08 16:20:57+00:00\n","Cryptocurrency Futures and Prediction Markets Show Trump Wins the US 2020 Election\n","\n","In less than 270 days the United States will have its 2020 election and millions of people worldwide will be betting on whether Donald Trump is reelected. Cryptocurrency participants are currently wagering their digital assets on the election outcome, where the odds on prediction markets and betting sites indicate Trump will likely win.\n","\n","Also read: New Regency Television Wins Screen Rights to Onecoin Story – The Missing Cryptoqueen\n","\n","Crypto Traders Are Betting Donald Trump Will Win the US 2020 Election\n","\n","Whether you love him or hate him, Donald Trump gathers a lot of attention and the U.S. will be facing another presidential election soon. On February 6, the crypto trading platform FTX Exchange revealed a futures contract based on the 2020 U.S. election results. FTX is letting traders who do not live in America the chance to purchase short and long positions on Donald Trump winning the election in November. The exchange launched a token called TRUMP to represent the futures agreement. (TRUMP) is a futures contract on FTX,” the company noted. [The token] expires to $1 if Donald Trump wins the 2020 US presidential general election, and $0 otherwise.”\n","\n","At the time of publication, each token is trading for $0.62, which means as of today the odds are in favor (62% chance) of Trump being reelected, according to FTX traders. The exchange FTX is not the only business running the odds and placing bets on the 2020 U.S. election. Gambling operations and bookmaking sites all over the internet are offering people the chance to bet for or against Donald Trump this year. For the most part, the odds across the board look to be in favor of Trump winning. For example, US-bookies.com disclosed at the end of 2019 that bookmakers in the country say Trump will win the election. The company researches and tracks bookmaking and gambling operations located in the U.S.\n","\n","“Over the past week, Mr. Trump went from 1/1 to 10/11 to win the 2020 Presidential election,” the company stressed. Just recently the head of public relations at the UK bookmaking firm Paddy Power, Lee Price, also explained the odds are in favor of Trump winning again. “This time, he’s odds on, so, more likely than not to be reelected,” Price said.\n","\n","Trump Bets Using the Prediction Market Augur and Gambling Sites That Accept Crypto for Election Wagers\n","\n","Cryptocurrency users are also leveraging the prediction market Augur built on the Ethereum blockchain to bet on the election. With the Augur platform, users can create prediction markets so people can utilize the software in order to predict certain outcomes. One popular Augur market called “Who will be the 2020 Republican Nominee for president?” has $20,594 at stake and ends in nine months. According to the Augur platform, there’s a 95% chance Donald Trump will win the election in 2020.\n","\n","This particular Augur market is a multiple-choice market and the website predictions.global explains “this is the predicted and winning choice.” Additionally, the second most popular prediction market on the Augur platform is also about the 2020 election. The question is: “Will Donald J. Trump be elected and be inaugurated as President of the United States for the 2021-2025 presidential term?” Augur’s prediction declares 55% say “yes” Trump will be elected and inaugurated again this year.\n","\n","Besides the new FTX TRUMP futures contracts and the bets on Augur, a slew of online betting sites that are hosting election wagers also accept digital currencies for betting. Sites like Betmoose, Fairlay, Mybookieag, Sportsbookag, Vegaselectionodd.com, and Oddsshark will allow registered users to bet on the U.S. 2020 election by leveraging $5 to $5,000 worth of cryptocurrencies. Most of these websites also show that Trump is favored to win and other candidates with decent odds include Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren.\n","\n","What do you think about cryptocurrency participants betting for or against Donald Trump winning the 2020 election?

It involves the use of a physical key to reinforce 2FA, hardening your online accounts from attack. In this guide, we’ll explain how to use a Yubikey to lock down your exchange account, email account, and other valuable online accounts.\n","\n","Also read: German Economy in Risk of Recession Amid Weak Demand, Tariff Threat, and Epidemic\n","\n","\n","\n","U2F Is Physical 2FA for the Security Conscious\n","\n","If you’re at heightened risk of online attack, say, cos you’re a sysadmin or cryptocurrency trader, you should take steps to secure your accounts. Most bitcoiners already use 2FA, such as the Google Authenticator app, to secure their crypto accounts. U2F takes that to another level by mandating use of a physical key that is inserted into the USB port of your device, or held in proximity to your smartphone if it’s an NFC key. Even in the event of malware being installed on your computer, or your 2FA recovery codes being stolen, a U2F key should keep attackers at bay.\n","\n","For the purposes of this guide, we’ll be using a Yubikey, one of the most popular devices on the market. (Google, for its part, also recommends the Feitian keys.) Manufacturer Yubico boasts “Zero recorded account takeovers in 11 years” because “the physical key requires a human touch and cannot be remotely hacked.” Lose your key, however, and things get a little complicated, since unlike Google Authenticator, Yubikeys don’t come with recovery codes. We’ll troubleshoot that problem shortly, once we’ve covered the basics.\n","\n","One Key to Secure Them All\n","\n","Yubikeys retail for around $50 apiece and, like hardware wallets, are best ordered direct from the manufacturer to prevent tampering. Yubico supplies a range of keys including a Nano version whose compactness makes it suitable for leaving permanently plugged in to the USB slot of a trusted desktop computer. The 5 series is the range that most consumers will opt for. They’re designed to secure Google, Microsoft, Github, Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter, and Lastpass accounts, as well as various crypto related platforms.\n","\n","Yubico works with Binance, Bitfinex, Bitmex, Kraken, and hundreds more companies across dozens of industries. Attend any developer-oriented crypto conference and you’ll see U2F keys plugged into laptops and dangling from keychains worn by delegates. You don’t have to be in charge of your team’s Github repo to warrant a Yubikey, however – simply holding crypto on a centralized exchange can be cause enough. Plus, in an era of NFC, biometrics, QR codes, and contactless payments, it feels badass to be carrying a physical key with magical powers.\n","\n","Using Your U2F Key\n","\n","If you’re intent on locking down your accounts with the aid of a Yubikey or similar U2F device, the first place to start is your email. If you’re a Google user, the Advanced Protection portal will guide you through the process. Other email providers including Protonmail also support the U2F protocol.\n","\n","Next, you should secure your cryptocurrency accounts, including any exchanges you trade on, in the same manner. Add a Yubikey to your Binance account, for instance, and you’ll be prompted to plug it into your computer every time you log in or withdraw. It effectively replaces the 2FA you will have been using up until now.\n","\n","If you’re wondering what happens if your U2F key is lost, broken, or stolen, many sites will let you pair multiple keys, providing redundancy in the event of key loss. Unfortunately, Binance is not one of them. Lose your key and you’ll need to initiate Binance’s account recovery process, which may take a few days to complete and will require alternate verification.\n","\n","U2F keys aren’t perfect, then, or to be more accurate, there are situations where their security model comes at the expense of convenience. If you’re intent on using one, though, that’s a sacrifice you’ll be willing to make in the quest of greater security. Where possible, pair two U2F keys with each of your online accounts, and keep your master key securely stored on a chain at all times. Once implemented, using a U2F key every time you log in will become second nature.\n","\n","What’s your experience of using U2F keys? Would you recommend them?

These professionals all come from differing backgrounds—one person might have come from working in development, whilst another from economics, or a director from an executive corporate environment, but one thing they all have in common is their imagination and willingness to think outside of the box. Each of our heroes are united by that rare quality of being visionaries with the ability to spot and seize and act upon the technological opportunities of the future. For each of them their victory is to analyse, to innovate, to build, and to implement an effective action strategy for success.\n","\n","Today, we’ve gathered the top 10 most influential people in the cryptocurrency market—the creators of the largest projects that have influenced the development of the entire industry.\n","\n","Satoshi Nakamoto\n","\n","The creator of Bitcoin\n","\n","Age: Unknown\n","\n","Rocking in as the undisputed number one on our list is ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ the creator of Bitcoin, and the most mysterious personality in the cryptocurrency industry. Indeed, not only does nobody know whether it is one person, or a group of developers, the very fact that of whether this legendary figure actually exists has often been called into question. Is Satoshi Nakamoto just a pseudonym?\n","\n","Be that as it may, it was ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ who developed the Bitcoin protocol and created the first version of the software.\n","\n","Of course, there’s a wealth of speculation as to real identify of ‘Nakamoto,’ and several theories have come to light to unmask him. Indeed, as we seek to unmask his true identify, let’s take a look at the two leading suspects.\n","\n","Nick Szabo is one of the rumoured candidates for the ‘Nakamoto’ crown. Szabo is a well-known cryptologist and lawyer, the developer of smart contract technology, the Bit Gold algorithm of decentralised virtual currency and the publication of which appeared just a few short months before Nakamoto's article on Bitcoin.\n","\n","Craig Wright is one of the most scandalous candidates for being the real Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2015, this Australian entrepreneur told the world that it was he who created the unique technology and filed more than 150 patent applications for the authorship of distributed registry technology, smart contracts, and six cryptocurrencies. In his favour, the patents were undisputed, and this didn’t lead to any legal consequences.\n","\n","Vitalik Buterin\n","\n","The founder of Ethereum\n","\n","Age: 26 years old\n","\n","Buterin gained his fame as the creator of the world's second-largest digital currency in terms of capitalization: Ethereum. Buterin is a true child prodigy: at the tender age of just 7, he wrote his first computer game using Excel macros! Then, aged 10 he studied C ++ and began developing full-fledged games. Blockchain arrived into his life in 2011, and by 2013 he’d already realized the shortcomings of Bitcoin. This gave him the idea to create his own unique cryptocurrency platform, and by 2014 he had funded and launched his project Ethereum through an online crowd-sale.\n","\n","It can be said that it was Buterin who indirectly initiated the ICO (initial coin offering)-hype, made the Ethereum code open-source (made it available to the general public). This allowed hundreds of developers to write their own projects on the Ethereum blockchain, while saving resources and time. Tokens created on Ethereum are called ERC-20 (Ethereum Request For Comments and 20)—today there are more than a thousand.\n","\n","Pavel Durov\n","\n","The founder of VK and Telegram\n","\n","Age: 35 years old\n","\n","Pavel Durov is the talented Russian entrepreneur and the developer best known for founding the social networking site VK, and then later Telegram. At just 22 years of age, Durov had already launched his social network VKontakte, but at 28 he was forced to leave the project due to disagreements with shareholders. This allowed him to focus on Telegram—the messenger that brought Durov worldwide fame. By the end of 2017, Telegram was already worth more than $1 billion, which made its creator a dollar billionaire.\n","\n","Until 2018, the name of Durov wasn’t associated with cryptocurrencies, however, in that Telegram announced the development of the Telegram Open Network—a secure embedded proxy and blockchain platform anonymizer. Durov plans to launch messaging and data storage services on it, as well as payment tools in his own cryptocurrency of the GRAM project. They will also add the ability for developers to create their own applications. 2018 also marked the time when the messenger attracted $1.7 billion from more than 170 investors for the development of new two projects: the Gram cryptocurrency, and the TON blockchain platform.\n","\n","Changpen Zhao\n","\n","The founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance\n","\n","Age: 43 years old\n","\n","The Chinese Canadian Changpen Zhao is one of the most prominent figures in the crypto industry. He’s the founder and CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, as of April 2018, an international cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in Hong Kong. Changpen Zhao is better known in the cryptocurrency community as CZ. And, CZ has an enormous following. His Twitter account has almost half a million crypto zombie followers who feast on reading his hundreds of articles and posts and hanging on his every word. With an estimated net worth, according to the Forbes rich list, of $1.2 billion, Zhao earned his first billion dollar in less than six months and is today one of the richest representatives of the crypto industry.\n","\n","Since the beginning of his career, CZ has specialised in trading—he first worked in the IT department of the New York Stock Exchange, and then moved on to Bloomberg to develop a service for traders. Thanks to the experience of the fundraising, it took the Binance exchange only 180 days to become the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Today, according to the exchange’s blog, the average daily trading volume of Binance is $2,852,591,354, with more than 15 million traders from around the world trading on the exchange. Additionally, Binance is one of the few exchanges that provides margin and futures trading services.\n","\n","Brian Armstrong\n","\n","The co-founder of Coinbase\n","\n","Age: 35 years old\n","\n","Brian Armstrong is the founder and CEO of Coinbase, a California cryptocurrency exchange. Brian has been interested in development since his high school days—as a teenager he studied the Java and CSS programming languages, and then, having received two degrees in computer science and economics, he worked as a programmer for major companies.\n","\n","In 2012, after receiving venture capital funding, he launched Coinbase—one of the world’s first cryptocurrency exchanges. Today, Coinbase is one of the most popular platforms for exchanging fiat money for cryptocurrencies. Traders can buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether and Litecoin using their regular bank cards. In August 2017, when cryptocurrency fever first swept the world, the mobile version of the Coinbase exchange in the AppStore became the most downloaded application in the US.\n","\n","Brandon Chez\n","\n","The CEO and founder Coinmarketcap\n","\n","Age: 33 years old\n","\n","Brandon Chaz is a 33-year-old US programmer, and the founder of Coinmarketcap, the largest online cryptocurrency aggregator. This site consolidates data from all exchanges and based on this data determines the value of cryptocurrency. Users can learn basic information about cryptocurrencies: capitalization, price, number of circulating coins, trading volume in 24 hours, percentage of price change per hour, 24 hours, and per week.\n","\n","The name of Brandon Chez is associated with the largest crash in the cryptocurrency market in history. On January 8, 2018, almost all cryptocurrencies fell in value by 15 per cent or more, and the market capitalization decreased by $100,000,000,000. Chez was figured as the culprit; it turns out that on February 7, his Coinmarketcap excluded data from South Korean exchanges without warning, the prices of which are consistently above the world average, and resultantly, the value of Bitcoin fell, pulling down all the other cryptocurrencies along with it.\n","\n","Charlie Lee\n","\n","Litecoin creator\n","\n","Age: Unknown\n","\n","Charlie Lee is a talented programmer and computer scientist from Japan, an iconic figure in the crypto industry, and the creator of the third cryptocurrency in history: Litecoin. Before Litecoin, Lee worked as a developer for Google. He learnt about blockchain in 2011 by reading an article on Bitcoin. The innovative technology was incredibly interesting to him, and he immediately bought one Bitcoin for $30. In that same year, in October 2011, Lee created the open source cryptographic protocol Litecoin, an early Bitcoin spinoff of Altcoin, and also got a job at the largest Coinbase exchange. In the summer of 2017, Charlie Lee left Coinbase and completely focused on developing Litecoin.\n","\n","The main purpose of Litecoin is payments on the Internet. In addition, like Ethereum, on Litecoin’s blockchain developers can create their own applications.\n","\n","Alex Reinhardt\n","\n","The Founder of PLATINCOIN\n","\n","Age: 38 years old\n","\n","Alex Reinhardt is a serial entrepreneur, and venture investor from Germany. Alex is the founder of more than 10 projects in the IT and fintech industries with a total capitalisation of over €200 million. In 1996, when Alex was 15 years old, his family emigrated to Germany and lived on social security benefits for the first few years. None of the family knew German, so they faced many challenges, were living hand to mouth, and facing a difficult future. It was Reinhardt who pulled the family up by the bootstraps and used his charisma to help him to urgently learn to speak the German language. The rest, as they say is history, and by the 11th grade, in 1998, Alex had begun to earn thousands of marks by selling products to German pension funds. Between 2002 and 2013, he was involved in attracting investments in start-ups and young companies, and in just over 10 years he’d raised more than €500,000,000 for them.\n","\n","In 2015, he survived the betrayal of partners who had effectively bankrupted his business. Huge debts and the necessity to pay bills became a call to action, so by using all his experience and innate talent as a salesman, as well as his brilliant experience in crypto trading, Alex launched his most successful project to date—PLATINCOIN. PLATINCOIN is a global cryptosystem that includes more than 10 high-tech products and services. The audience of the company's product audience is more than 500,000 people around the world, and every day there are more and more users.\n","\n","The main goal of all PLATINCOIN products is to make cryptocurrencies accessible to every user in the world and give people a simple tool to enter the financial market, which today is more than 2 billion people are deprived of.\n","\n","David A. Marcus\n","\n","Libra director, and the former president of PayPal\n","\n","Age: 46 years old\n","\n","David Marcus is an American entrepreneur born in Paris. Since April 2012, David has been the director of PayPal. In August 2014, he became the vice-president of messaging products at Facebook where he heads the Facebook Messenger unit. In parallel with his work on Facebook, David actively studied blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and in 2017 became a member of the board of directors of the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. Since 2018, David has been responsible for the Facebook blockchain business, and since June 2019 he has headed the Calibra project.\n","\n","Calibra or Libra is a new cryptocurrency developed by Facebook and other companies. Libra is perhaps one of the most controversial blockchain projects, and opinions are divided about it. On the one hand, some sees the Facebook initiative as a threat to the anonymity and decentralisation of the blockchain, whilst, on the other hand, others see it as the long-awaited breakthrough for the technology.\n","\n","According to a white paper published in the summer, Libra is a global currency based on blockchain technology, the value of which is tied to a basket of real world currencies (for example, US dollar, euro, Japanese yen). The cost of Libra is equal to the weighted average exchange rate of these currencies. The initial issue of Libra is scheduled for this year in 2020.\n","\n","Roger Ver\n","\n","CEO of Bitcoin.com\n","\n","Age: 40 years old\n","\n","Roger Ver is a true crypto world legend. Known as the ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ for his promotion of Bitcoin, Roger made his first profit by buying and reselling hard drives on his summer school holidays. The business grew, and in 1999, Ver launched an online personal computer accessory shop, which he still runs to this day.\n","\n","When Roger Ver found out about Bitcoin in 2011, he started investing heavily in technology and also began conducting educational activities. He posted advertisements on roadside billboards and posted them on the Internet, he lectured to schoolchildren and distributed free tokens. It was then that he earned the title of the ‘Bitcoin Jesus’.\n","\n","Ver is quite the colourful character, and between these two stages of his life, Ver spent 10 years in prison for illegally selling explosives, ran for the California State Assembly from the Libertarian Party, left the US for Japan, and renounced US citizenship.\n","\n","In the crypto community, Roger Ver is known as an ardent supporter of Bitcoin Cash: one of the famous forks of Bitcoin. Right after the spinoff, Roger announced that this digital asset was developing exactly along the path that was originally intended for Bitcoin. His main bugbear with Bitcoin is what he claims is its too small block size and his gripe with the low transaction speed.\n","\n","And remember, cryptocurrency: ‘It’s money 2.0, a huge, huge, huge deal.’ —Chamath Palihapitiya, venture capitalist\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/banks-germany-crypto/\n","https://news.bitcoin.com/banks-germany-crypto/\n","[]\n","2020-02-11 04:00:10+00:00\n","40 Banks in Germany Declare Intent to Offer Crypto Services Under New Law\n","\n","More than 40 financial institutions in Germany have reportedly declared to the country’s financial regulator, BaFin, their interest to offer cryptocurrency services under the new German law.

The spokesperson, however, would not comment on the number of banks that have submitted this expression of interest.\n","\n","The new German Money Laundering Act which went into effect at the beginning of the year allows financial institutions to offer their customers cryptocurrencies alongside traditional investment products, such as stocks and bonds.\n","\n","Expressions of Interest to Offer Crypto Services\n","\n","BaFin explained that companies will not receive an immediate acknowledgment of receipt or an assessment of the information submitted on their expression of interest.

The SEC will argue that entrepreneurs from the encrypted messaging app Telegram breached securities laws when they raised nearly $2 billion to develop a new blockchain platform. Telegram will counter that it wasn’t required to register its offering – and that the cryptocurrency tokens investors will receive are not in the SEC’s purview. Blockchain industry groups, as I told you last month, filed amicus briefs in the case, pleading with the SEC to provide clearer regulations for digital assets and to set out a better-defined path to launch blockchains.\n","\n","It turns out that at least one SEC commissioner agrees with a lot of what Telegram and its backers have said.\n","\n","Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.\n","\n","Last week, Commissioner Hester Peirce delivered a speech at the International Blockchain Congress in which she acknowledged the “regulatory Catch 22” for legitimate developers who want to build cryptocurrency networks without running afoul of U.S. securities laws. \"The SEC’s approach in these cases has made it extremely difficult for a company to distribute a token without running into a charge that the company is engaged in a securities offering,\" the commissioner said.\n","\n","Peirce proposed a new enforcement regime in which the SEC would grant network developers a three-year safe harbor to establish active, decentralized trading of their cryptocurrency tokens, according to a written version of the speech. Peirce’s plan would allow developers to raise capital by offering tokens to investors and would permit secondary transactions without treating the tokens as securities – exactly the rules that Telegram and the blockchain industry groups are pushing in the case before Judge Castel.\n","\n","Commissioner Peirce did not mention the Telegram case in her speech, but Telegram’s lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom certainly took note of what she said. On Thursday, Telegram filed a letter to Judge Castel, alerting him about the speech and hinting that Peirce’s comments will figure in the company’s defense.\n","\n","An SEC spokeswoman and Telegram counsel Alexander Drylewski of Skadden declined to comment on what impact, if any, Commissioner Peirce’s comments will have at next week’s hearing. But Judge Castel is clearly mulling the appropriate regulation of cryptocurrency: In an order issued last Thursday, he invited the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to opine on its role. Telegram has argued that cryptocurrency tokens should be regarded as commodities subject to CFTC regulation, rather than securities under the SEC’s jurisdiction.\n","\n","It’s easier to understand the issues at stake in the Telegram case when you know some of the facts. Telegram’s founders believed they could develop a blockchain network that would be faster and more secure than Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose currencies have become so widely circulated that the SEC doesn’t regard them as securities. To build the network, Telegram conducted two private offerings to sophisticated institutional investors, raising $1.7 billion. In exchange, investors were slated to receive 2.9 billion digital tokens, known as Grams, that would eventually be used on the Telegram platform.\n","\n","Telegram acknowledged that the contracts it offered to investors were securities, but it contended that its private placement was exempt from the SEC’s registration requirements. The company believes that Grams themselves are not securities. The whole point of the Telegram blockchain network, according to the company’s motion for summary judgment, is to create a new, widely circulated and decentralized digital currency that will function, like every currency, as a medium of exchange. Telegram said it has strived to reassure the SEC that Grams are not securities but has been stymied by the commission’s ill-defined standards for digital assets.\n","\n","The SEC, meanwhile, sued Telegram in October to halt the launch of the blockchain platform before Grams could begin trading. According to the commission’s summary judgment brief, Grams can’t be disentangled from the investment contracts between Telegram and its investors. Under the U.S. Supreme Court’s definition of a security in 1946’s SEC v. Howey, the digital currency is a securities, like a stock certificate. So every transaction involving a Gram, in the SEC’s view, is subject to securities laws and must be conducted by a broker.\n","\n","The two sides disagree on whether Telegram truly intends Grams to be so widely traded that the company and its investors won’t retain control of the market. The SEC said that Telegram planned to retain about 2 billion Grams, which would give the company the ability to affect the tokens’ market value. Telegram has said that its goal is an independent market and that it’s willing to assuage the SEC’s concerns. In fact, Telegram contends, it tried to work with the SEC in advance of its anticipated platform launch, but instead of providing guidance, the commission sued. (The SEC has said that Telegram only started talking to the commission after the SEC began investigating Telegram’s private offering.)\n","\n","A centerpiece of the preliminary injunction hearing next week will be whether the SEC has provided clear rules for blockchain developers. Telegram has asserted an affirmative defense that the SEC’s view of digital assets is so imprecise that the company did not have constitutionally sufficient notice that its offering and anticipated launch of Grams trading was problematic. The SEC has moved to strike that defense, pointing to evidence that Telegram tinkered with its plans to avoid triggering securities laws.\n","\n","Commissioner Peirce most definitely didn’t say the SEC’s guidance is unconstitutionally vague, but she did say that the commission’s rules are very difficult for legitimate entrepreneurs to navigate. “When we see people struggling to find a way both to comply with the law and accomplish their laudable objectives, we need to ask ourselves whether the law should change to enable them to pursue their efforts in confidence that they are doing so legally,” Peirce said in last week’s speech. She highlighted criticism that the SEC has “elided the distinction” between investment contracts to raise the capital to create a cryptocurrency network and the token that will subsequently trade through the network, citing the “disastrous consequences” when the SEC conflates tokens and investment contracts. That is precisely the argument that Telegram is advancing.\n","\n","Obviously, Peirce is just one SEC commissioner and her proposed safe harbor for cryptocurrencies is still just an idea. Even if the SEC eventually adopts a version of Commissioner Peirce’s three-year pause on enforcement against blockchain developers that satisfy conditions intended to protect investors, it will be too late for Telegram, which is hoping to persuade Judge Castel to allow its platform to launch right away. But I have no doubt that Peirce’s speech will crop up at next week’s hearing. It’s not every day, after all, that an SEC commissioner essentially echoes the arguments of an SEC enforcement target.\n","https://coingeek.com/list-or-die-when-will-crypto-exchanges-see-the-light-on-bsv/\n","https://coingeek.com/list-or-die-when-will-crypto-exchanges-see-the-light-on-bsv/\n","[]\n","2020-02-10 13:00:08+00:00\n","TLDR: It doesn’t matter because tokenization on BSV is the future.\n","\n","Economic reality is starting to catch up to digital asset exchanges that continue to refuse to list Bitcoin SV (BSV). Bitcoin has defied those who colluded to kill it, becoming the fifth highest such asset by market cap in January 2020, third largest by market cap after removing Ripple which isn’t even a public blockchain and Ethereum which was pre-mined and is now moving to Proof of Stake. “List or die,” wrote Bitcoin investor Calvin Ayre, signaling the market would eventually punish those who willfully refuse to acknowledge BSV’s value.\n","\n","Cryptocurrency exchange customers will increasingly demand to know why they can’t either trade BSV or claim BSV ownership from their pre-fork BTC or BCH balances. Should exchanges continue to refuse, they may face a reputational or legal backlash.\n","\n","Not only is BSV the globally dominant platform in the world for all types of utility, its also the market leader for capital gains so far this year and predicted to also be for the rest of the year and its 3rd in the world for market cap for real public blockchains. List or die. — Calvin Ayre (@CalvinAyre) February 8, 2020\n","\n","But it’s about far more than listing a single asset. With the activation of Bitcoin v1.0.0, or “Genesis” at the start of February 2020, Bitcoin gained full power for use as a platform for tokenization. Should projects begin to build legal and tradeable digital tokens on a platform that actually scales, Bitcoin will present serious competition to today’s popular platforms like Ethereum and EOS.\n","\n","If (or more like when) that starts to happen, continued refusal to list BSV will disappoint far more customers than just BSV traders. Will today’s exchanges change their course, or will they be replaced by a new, more legally compliant, breed?\n","\n","A few days ago, we looked at the decisions of exchanges like Binance, Kraken and ShapeShift to “delist BSV” in 2019. There were also others that never listed BSV at all, but were happy to snatch the coins themselves after the blockchain forks while denying their customers any access to them.\n","\n","When these exchanges delisted Bitcoin BSV nearly a year ago, they expected the sharp drop in active price speculators would crash the price and eventually kill the coin. While there was an initial price drop, the longer-term strategy didn’t work: not only is the BSV price now higher than it was in April 2019, it’s the #5 digital asset by market cap on popular trading data sites. At one point, its market cap surpassed BCH.\n","\n","The exchanges that scorned BSV have put themselves in a difficult position. Should BSV achieve its stated goals, traders will want to know why it isn’t listed on the exchanges they use. The exchanges will need to address their concerns somehow, or risk losing valuable customers to other platforms. A thriving market for tokens based on BSV smart contracts will only exacerbate their woes, by creating an economy that potentially far exceeds Bitcoin’s market cap.\n","\n","What token trading really should be\n","\n","BSV proposes a different kind of token model. Unlike the shady “ICO” model of the past few years, tokens would represent actual legal assets, including company shares, national currencies, or ownership of any other valuable asset. Their value won’t be speculative, but based on the real market value of the underlying assets they represent.\n","\n","That’s how Bitcoin BSV sees token trading in the future. Exchanges wishing to trade these digital assets will need to act responsibly and ethically, as will the token-based projects they list. There will be increased scrutiny from authorities like the SEC and CFTC—good news and potentially large profits for exchanges that follow the law, but bad news for those who wish to continue acting as “bucket shops” or unregulated casinos. Regulators are unlikely to look favorably at exchanges who colluded to destroy the market value of their users’ assets.\n","\n","Whether the exchanges mentioned above delisted BSV based on ideology or for business/financial reasons, as of 2020 their decisions have backfired. It’s not too late for them to change their ways, even if they have to eat some humble pie in the process.\n","\n","New to Bitcoin?
